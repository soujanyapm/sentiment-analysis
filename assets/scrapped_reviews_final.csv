"Absolutely love my new pieces! I bought both the climbers and the cuff pictured because I liked the look so much, and they work just as wonderfully together on my ears. Beautiful jewelry!"
This picture does not do it justice. I got the earrings and two ear cuffs. My oh my they are beautiful! I‚Äôm so excited to wear these!!
Absolutely gorgeous! I‚Äôm in love with my new set! Fast shipping too! I would definitely buy from here again!
"This came out wayyy better than I expected! I used these ear climbers for my wedding and they were super cute. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because I lost 1 ear climber at the end of the day. :( I know I had put it on correctly and tightened it, but it didn‚Äôt hold up. Otherwise, the earrings are still great!"
Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!
"Ah beh, questo √® per me! √à davvero molto carino, ben fatto ed √® resistente. √à un oggetto particolare con colori vivaci, proprio come in foto. Ma non immaginatevi una cosa vistosa. Si fa notare con delicatezza. E di questi tempi anche i colori aiutano lo spirito! Dei venditori sono ugualmente entusiasta."
"I‚Äôve been searching for Ear Crawlers that speaks to me, and I cannot believe this is the most beautiful set, and my very first pair of Ear Crawlers that I finally found. They are exquisitely made and stunning! This is truly an artist at work....packaged very nicely...I am thrilled and will always appreciate them. Thank You..."
"I love love love it so beautiful, I have received many compliments. Shipping was fast considering it came from a great distance."
I really really love this earrings :). They look nice on my ears and I got compliments on how lovely it looks. Thank you very much :). Highly recommend.
"Vielen Dank f√ºr diese tollen, einzigartigen Ohrringe. Die Verarbeitung und Qualit√§t ist super, und au√üerdem ging der Versand richtig schnell, hat keine Woche gedauert."
They are stunning! I have pretty sensitive ears. The weight nor the material irritate them. Will stay in place pretty well. Highly recommend.
"Amazing! Te color violet is gorgeous, and they're very comfy. Totally worth it!"
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
Purchased 2 different earrings as shown on photo. Dainty but sparkly with a secure back fastening. Looks beautiful on the lobe or on the helix. Good communication from seller and well package for transportation. Comes with certificate. Would purchase again.
"5 stars üåü for my Moon üåô phase silver earrings ‚ú®üôè!! I love them !! I love the Moon üåôüíõ!!! These earrings capture all the phases of the Moon üåô. Thank you for shipping, packaging and delivered on time üëçüèªüòâ!! They arrived safely after a long journey to the UNITED STATES üá∫üá∏!!! Thank you. Constance from Iowa ‚òÆÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è."
"These are beautiful! They were a Christmas gift for myself. I do wish the wire fit a little tighter to my ear; because my earlobes are thin, they tend to drop instead of climb. But even then, I still love the way they look!"
Absolutely stunning ear climbers! I will say it's not super mask compatible. It accidentally fell off when I went to take my mask off and if I hadn't paid attention I would have lost it. If you aren't clumsy like me that might not be a problem! :)
"I love these earrings so much! They arrived earlier than I expected, which was a plus because I wanted to wear them straight away! I've been wavering about purchasing them for a while and I'm so glad I finally did! I wear them in my second piercing while I wear my starbursts in my first and I feel so cosmic when I do! These are great and just as cute as expected."
"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
"My package arrived today and it's exactly what I expected!! The earrings are easy to put in. While they represent the moon, they are also perfect for the upcoming North American solar eclipse. Thank you!!!"
"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
"I love them so much; I didn't understand how to put them on at first, but it took me less than 2 minutes. If they feel loose, I can just squeeze them a bit. I would definitely buy more, plus they came in the cutest little corkscrew bottle ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"These are lovely! I wasn‚Äôt sure how they would look since most of the pictures were of the climbers in the lower lobe / first piercing hole and I planned on wearing them up higher. (Plus my second piercing spot there is really, really old so it‚Äôs lower than I‚Äôd like now) but they still work and look beautiful. It‚Äôs nice having something a little different! Nice color and great quality, too."
"Got so many compliments on these earrings. Love them and for the price, super great! Highly recommend"
"This is the second pair of ear crawlers I bought from VermeilSupplies, and I was not disappointed! My favorite thing about these crawlers is that they stay in place perfectly - not too tight, and I don't find myself having to inch them back into place throughout the day."
"Love these earrings so much, I just ordered a second pair. Good quality and good price. Had some trouble with shipping (item didnt arrive) but seller shipped a second pair at no extra charge. The earrings are a perfect size. :)"
Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho! I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes.
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"I saw this design in an Etsy promotional email, and I knew I had to have it! It's the first earring with a jacket that I had ever seen, and I love how delicate it looks. People say it looks like spikes, but it looks like a star with its beams of light to me. I love it so much. The earrings and the jacket are both well made and sturdy. Despite being based in Spain, they shipped quickly and arrived within a week!"
"These are beautiful earrings that give just enough interest to an outfit. I love wearing them with just regular tees or with casual dresses. I got them in gold and they perfectly complement my boyish pixie cut. Lalia quickly shipped my purchase the day after I ordered them, but because she's based in Spain, it took about a week and a half to get to the U.S. (just to give you a heads up). The earrings are well worth the wait though, I promise!!"
Absolutely love the cuffs! They are the perfect size. They stay on my ear. I have worn them overnight and they are still on in the morning! The earrings are a different story. They look exactly like the picture but they are so long. They actually slide right off my ear and just dangle which looks terrible. I would recommend getting the shorter ones. But they are very dainty and seem well made. Very happy.
Albina makes such beautiful pieces- I absolutely love my ear cuffs and ear climber. She was so kind in her customer service as I needed to exchange sizes and she was so helpful and quick in shipping the right sizes out and letting me do so! I will definitely be ordering more pieces from her in the future. If I could give her a 100 star rating I would! Just lovely all around!
"omg I love my pair. I went to my 6 moth oncology appt and my oncologist remarked on them, so I am ordering a pair for her"
"This set of earring is the best. I love them! They fit perfectly and also the gold coating is a strong one (I recently made a bad experience where I also bought earrings, but the coating came of after 4 days of wearing them!) Its always risky to purchase things over the internet, but not with this seller. I put all my trust in her and I am going to purchase even more from her. Highly recommended =)"
Perfectly beautiful earrings! I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
These are absolutely stunning and surpassed my hopes and expectations by far. Absolutely love them.
"This seller provides excellent customer service. My earjackets were lost in mail & a replacement pair arrived in the blink of an eye. I love these. Really. See my 2nd review, I bought another pair!"
"Unique! Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides. still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
Love them! Great quality and I get so many compliments. Shipped promptly and even with COVID delays still managed to get here in time for holiday season. Will definitely be ordering more pieces.
Absolutely love these earrings. Haven't taken them off since i got them. They are truly beautiful. Just want them in gold now!
"Such a beautiful set of earrings, I‚Äôve been on the hunt for earrings which look very sophisticated and these are perfect! They fit so well and do not fall off the lobe. This is my new fav seller and I‚Äôll definitely be buying more jewellery soon!"
Absolutely LOVE it! I‚Äôm addicted to this beautiful jewellery. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend. Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address. She caught it very quickly and then changed my address. I received them and worth a purchase. Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy. Dorothy Calgary
"Love these mandala earrings: delicate design, light and comfortable to wear. Sent quickly, boxed for safety, arrived safe! Highly recommended!"
Perfectly beautiful!
"Tr√®s jolie, juste la couleur qui est diff√©rente de l‚Äôimage, je croyais qu‚Äôelles √©taient or mais en fait elles sont argent."
Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
Beautiful earrings. Make me feel like a star and great colours!
Absolutely love these earrings! They are the perfect size and very unique! Wish I had bought a few more. They shipped right away but took about 2 months to receive due to covid (sat in US customs for a month). Definitely would recommend!
my order arrived today and as always the pieces are so beautiful. the lotus flower jacket earrings had to be replaced since i lost one. i love my new anklet and the half moon necklace is absolutely stunning. the gift was so unbelievably sweet of you dear inali. thank you so much.
Absolutely stunning! I have to say that there is nothing that you don't do beautifully! These earrings are modern but still very dainty and beautiful. I am a forever customer and HIGHLY recommend you to anyone looking for beautiful jewelry!!
Absolutely love the Lotus jacket! Super worth it and very fast shipping!
"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
"YES...buy the ring! I too was hesitant to purchase such a high end item online, so I did research, even contacting other reviewers here on Etsy about their purchases. Lena is AMAZING to work with. After choosing the band I wanted, Lena found (and sent me a video) of three different center stone options to fit my budget. The ring was estimated to be finished in 1-2 weeks, but it took three weeks because of Covid (understandable delay.) Before shipping, Lena again sent a video showing the finished product. The ring was shipped from Israel on a Thursday, and I had it in my possession in America on Monday! The ring is absolutely gorgeous. The color and sparkle of the diamonds are amazing. My wife and I are both very happy with this purchase. We will not hesitate to purchase more jewelry from Lena in the future."
I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)! Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
"Words can‚Äôt even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I‚Äôm so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience!"
Des bijoux simples et originaux. Parfaits pour des petits cadeaux √† se faire soi-m√™me.
"Envoi soign√©, boucles d'oreille tr√®s sympa !"
boucle doreille tr√®s jolies !
Simple et √©l√©gante. C‚Äôest parfait.
"I was so pleasantly surprised when I received these because they were more detailed and beautiful in person than what I saw on the picture. Unfortunately for me they didn‚Äôt fit my ears right, I have small ears so I‚Äôm not surprised, and when it reached out to the seller to ask for a return the customer service was phenomenal and the process was super easy. Even though this pair of earrings didn‚Äôt work out for me I will be looking for another pair through this seller"
"it fits well, especially the cuff. its snug but doesn't hurt, plus it's pretty!"
"Gorgeous earrings! A little tight, but easy to pull looser."
This mismatched pair of butterfly earrings is divine. They shipped and arrived quickly. Thank you!!!
I love ear climbers and this one of my favourite in my collection as it‚Äôs really elegant and makes a statement at the same time.
Love !!!! My 5th order!!! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Mom loves it a lot! This such a cute and fashionable style, good for everyday wears. Great quality ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Super cute and edgy! A cool on piece to add!
"Elegant design, perfect size for earlobe with only 1 piercing. My daughter loves her new pair of climbing earrings. I appreciated that Maya contacted me with a potential delay - it all worked out perfect."
"I got the silver ear crawler and I love it so much, it looks beautiful and it fits just right! Five stars for sure!"
So beautiful!!!! These are my first pair of climbers and will not be my last. They came in 4 days and I could not be happier!
"Absolutely stunning! Wore these for my wedding, they were very comfortable, unique and beautiful."
Shipping was delayed due to Covid and the seller went above and beyond to let me know. Jewelry looks a little smaller in person but is delicate and dainty. I get so many compliments when I wear them.
"These are beautiful. I love jewelry that is just a little different so these fish are great. The one gold one in with all the silver, so unique. Worth the wait (about a month) to get them from Germany"
"I love these earrings! Because of the climber design, I can wear them 24/7, even during sleep without getting poked. I also appreciate the mixed metals so I can pair with gold or silver."
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE these rings!!! It couldn‚Äôt have fit my existing ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù wedding band set anymore perfect!!! I also received earrings which are adorable as well!!! I may have to add to my collection now! Thank you!!!!
"SO cute, love them. Thank you for allowing me to be able to pick different letter to represent each of my babies!"
"Great quality, shipping time was off by almost a week but it‚Äôs the season!!! We‚Äôre decent size not too big but perfect for my 10 yr old initials!"
Love them üòç
Love love love!
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"I love these earrings! They are gorgeous and unique and sooo sparkly! They fit perfectly, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day! These earrings have the clamp on the back for the upper part of the earlobe so if your ears are small or not shaped right these might not fit great. Fast shipping and they were exactly as described. Thank you Iloniti!"
Absolutely gorgeous. She is so helpful and sent me earrings with boxes and bags. These are even more beautiful in person since she uses really great quality stones
"OtisJaxon is my new BFF. These are So Cool! Really beautiful, lightweight and comfortable to wear, shipped super quick -- can't ask for more! Love you OJ"
My wife loves anything I buy from Otis Jaxon! Their circle motif earrings are just beautiful- and each new pair is a guaranteed hit with my spouse. Thanks for making the most important person in my life happier!
"I'm very happy with these earrings and they look exactly like the picture. I get lots of compliments on them! They're simple, yet catch the eye because they are unique."
I just love them and have had lots of compliments already. Also great customer service from the seller üôÇ
"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. Thank you! ‚úåüèºÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
My new fave earrings! My hair is really short its not easy to have statement stud earrings that aren't bulky or childish. Love these!
Gorgeous earrings. Delicate and pretty. Love them. Will order more..
Tr√®s joli petit bijou que j'ai re√ßu avec plaisir. C'est un tr√®s joli travail qui correspond tout √† fait √† ce que j'attendais. Merci beaucoup !
I love it so much! My Atlantean pendant is so beautiful and great quality! I wear it every day and always get compliments on it. Thank you!
"Just recieved it today and i love it! It took about 3 weeks to ship to the US. I got the gold udjat bracelet and it is gorgeous. Light weight, nice to wear. And fits perfectly since I have smaller wrists. Love it and highly reccomend!"
"Bague vraiment tr√®s belle. Mr Michel Comte est accueillant, √† l'√©coute, disponible par t√©l si besoin, mais r√©alise surtout un travail d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. J'ai √©t√© bluff√© rapport qualit√©/prix. Sinc√®rement, cette bague et moi sommes maintenant ins√©parables, et je suis tr√®s heureuse de l'avoir command√© √† cet homme passionn√© par son m√©tier. Savoir qu'elle a √©t√© faite mains et non pas √† la cha√Æne la rend d'autant plus belle, pr√©cieuse et magique √† mes yeux. Je la recommande, et vous recommande cet artiste . Vous pouvez commander les yeux ferm√©s. Merci √† Vous Mr Comte."
"These are so great! I purchased a pair for my 20-year-old daughter and 17-year-old grand-daughter. They are NUTS over them. They are so adorable that I wish I'd gotten myself a pair! Gracy was so sweet, as well. I live in Michigan, so it took 3 weeks to arrive. Unfortunately, at Christmas, my package sat in US Customs for nearly 2 weeks!"

"Gorgeous earrings and absolutely amazing service! Delivery was much faster than expected and i received the earrings in a super cute little box, with personal handwritten messages AND a really pretty ring with my initial on it as a free (!) surprise gift. I love both the earrings and the ring, and wear them a lot, and can't praise Henju enough for the customer service. Will defo buy more stuff from her! :)"
"For international shipping, these earrings arrived very quickly! :) Love the minimalist design of these earrings! Fun to wear and not sharp. Looks just like the photo! Thank you!!"
"I love my ear climbers! They are som comfortable and exactly what I was looking for in my second hole. I used to not be able to wear earrings in the second hole because they would get irritated from the backs. So this solved my problem because there is no ‚Äòback‚Äô, it just slips on and stays put! I keep them in at all times, have had them a month now and haven‚Äôt taken them out once! I do live in USA and because they originate and ship from Spain it did take almost 2 months to get them in. So just a heads up the shipping took quite a long time! But I did eventually receive item and seller was very helpful in making sure they were received."
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love these earrings. More beautiful then pictured. Arrived very fast and had great communication with Shop. Highly recommend. A+ quality.
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
Beautiful earrings! I got many compliments.
"Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!"
"These are so pretty! They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy. They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone. I just wish they had more colors!"
"Absolutely love! Have been looking for ear climbers, and the look and quality are excellent"
"These earrings are so light and pretty. Simple, yet eye catching and trendy. Love them!!"
Absolutely love those earnings!!!! I was looking for something unique and I found it. They are nicely made and come in adorable packaging that can also be storage box for them. I love the fact that you can rotate tiny wind mills like you would in real life :) Overall fast delivery. Top notch. I recommend the seller.
I am absolutely in love with these! They're exactly as I imagined. I would definitely buy from this seller again!
So special!
"Such cute earrings! I ordered silver, however when I received them they were gold with purple pinwheels. However I just bought some paint from Ben Franklin and painted the pinwheels blue and the sticks silver, to match my wedding colors. n nThe pinwheels actually spin - SO CUTE! Love these earrings. n nAlso fast shipping. Great work! :)"
"Exactly as described and pictured. The seller was prompt to respond to my questions, make the bracelet, and ship my order. I am very happy with the quality of the materials and craftsmanship. I love this bracelet that I had made to celebrate my son's birth."
"Tr√®s belle bague, fine et raffin√©e. Un vrai travail de cr√©atrice et de joaillerie, qui conserve la beaut√© des mat√©riaux brut. Je suis tr√®s contente de mon choix."
"I just adore everything about this cool ring. Awesome design, really beautiful tourmaline with so many shades of forest green. I love the vibes of this gorgeous ring... A million thanks to a very talented artist!"
Je viens de recevoir ma bague pour mon anniversaire et... Quel cadeau ! Puret√© des lignes et magie de tourmaline...
"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all. I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
"Wowee, the hype is real. Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites. The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone. Very well made. Shipped crazy fast. Love this shop."
"Earrings came about 1 week after placing order (5d to CA). They're very pretty and unique, I'll definitely order again from this shop. Came with 2 pairs of rubber backings- perfect because I promptly flung one of the backings into the nether regions of my bathroom upon trying them on. Fits perfect. The bars are large, if you want a daintier look maybe go with a different stud combo (ie the leaves with a smaller bar)."
"These are even more gorgeous in person! Lovely packaging, timely delivery, and quality pieces! Couldn't be happier!"
Beautiful earrings as pictured. I do have a slight allergy to certain metals so I can‚Äôt keep them in too long. This is not the seller‚Äôs fault. She did amazing work! Thank you!
Arrived on Time! Love them! The are just the right size and stay on securely.
Terrific earrings. I missed wearing earrings but I wanted a pair that wouldn‚Äôt get caught in the ear loops of my Covid masks. These are perfect.
"I absolutely love them! They fit so well, and haven't fallen out since I put them in"
"Absolutely LOVE these! So unique :D Had some compliments on them too. I also suffer with allergies to nickel, chrome and gold and these are fine because they are as they say, silver Great service, thank you!"
"My ears have always been really sensitive to metals and these earrings are not only BEAUTIFUL, but they're treating my ding dang sensitive-as-heck ears very well. I love this simple, elegant design and I'm going to buy more pairs. Thank you!"
"I bought this as a gift and it is beautiful, and the packaging is so cute! Vera was very helpful and kind - I'll definitely be buying from her again!"
"Fast shipping, cute packaging, nice earrings! Will probably buy more from here one day."
"WOW! I love it! This is the first ear climber I've ever had and I was worried about the fit- This came in and I popped it on so easily. It feels very secure without pinching me and I can't even tell I'm wearing it. I also got the dark pearls with gold drips and am equally impressed with those. The seller was very forthcoming about how the shipping ended up being delayed due to world events, and I never felt worried about it."
"This earring is so cool! I love it. The quality and craftspersonship is wonderful. They packaged it with great care for shipping. Included a cleaning cloth and how to care card. The jewelry box it came in is lovely, unique looking and perfect size for storage to keep it safe from being bent. I will definitely order from Mariejune again."
"The design is really beautiful. I'm so happy with this purchase. Seller was sweet and communicative. When it was going to take a little longer to complete, she messaged me with a new ship date. In total, it took about a month from purchase to receipt. I'm ok with this since lead times and shipping times were warned ahead of purchase due to the pandemic."
"Love the look, love the quality, look the packaging Edit update: so many compliments on this jewelry üò≥üò≥üò≥‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Delicate and beautifully hand made, these were shipped quickly and securely! Maybe it is just my curved earlobes, but the triangle ear jackets weigh next to nothing so they may not hang straight downwards. Your ears may differ. Thank-you for the earrings."
"The earrings are beautiful and unique - I get so many questions and compliments about them, I am definitely purchasing from AIRlab again."
"These are my new favorite pair of earrings! They seriously go with everything. They were packaged securely and arrived in as timely a manner as I could have hoped, given that they came from another continent. I don't buy much jewelry, but I can definitely see myself buying more pieces from airlab!"
The earrings are fabulous! Greatly appreciate their simplicity & minimalistic nature. Thank you!!! <33
Wirklich sehr sch√∂ne und fein gearbeitete Ohrringe! Shop Inhaberin ist auch wirklich super nett und bei jeglichen Problemstellungen leicht zu kontaktieren und √§u√üerst hilfsbereit! :)
"Anja kept me in the loop with Covid shipping to the United States, and creates absolutely beautiful items! I love the ear crawlers, and they fit with no issues!"
I love these ear crawlers from LOVEYOURDIAMONDS. This was an amazing purchase.
"fast shipping, high quality earrings. beautiful, looks great. just love it!!! tnx"
First time buying crawlers. I first received them and they are very pretty! I put them and and discovered that I have fluffy earlobes and I was able to have a larger size made and now the fit wonderfully!! I absolutely love them!!
They are so pretty. I was surprised how easy they were to put in. They look adorable on me ?? Thank you Amy
Received in two days! Came in a small box wrapped in ribbon. Very happy with the size and quality.
Love my ear climber! It Came fast and with directions :). Looks exactly like the picture and fits very snug! Will be ordering more !
"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great! I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect! Fast shipping too.
"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding. You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way. Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great. I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm. You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
Love this earring it's extremely dainty for a bigger piece completely in love with it! Will definitely be using again in the future
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"Favoriting the shop and on the look out for new designs. Not as rose gold as I thought it would be but i loooove the look of it :) It's pretty comfortable and so far it feels nonexistent on my ears. I have incredibly sensitive ears as well, so that's saying a lot."
Shipping and response time was great. These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs ‚Äì I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it.
Elles sont tr√®s belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au d√©but mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
Beau produit. J'ai de Beaux commentaires sur mes boucles D'oreille minimalistes. Je les Aime beaucoup et le service est top!
"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all. Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
Love these little earrings! Have had many compliments on them. Took a little while to get here from Lithuania but worth it!
"These earrings are very well made and I love that they are so different. Shipping was prompt and all is well....including all the compliments I get. Thank you so much. Deb Lanigan ,, 5stars...easily"
Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
They look exactly the way I wanted them to. I'm really happy!
"magnifique de tr√®s bonne qualit√© , c‚Äôest la deuxi√®me paire que j‚Äôach√®te car j‚Äôen avais perdu une mais je ne regrette pas mon achat."
Die Bestellung wurde schnell geliefert. Die Verarbeitung ist sehr sch√∂n. Die Steine sitzen gut in der Fassung drin und sind abgerundet. Das Haar verf√§ngt sich nicht darin.
"Very special piece! Perfect size, excellent craftmanship!"
These earrings are really cute. I like the way they hug my ears and the rose gold is perfect blend! Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well.
"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."
"Shipped quicker than I thought! Only got the right silver one, but now I might have to get the left one too"
"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care! Thank you!!"

Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
Super pretty earclimbers and a perfect size too. Thanks!
The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics; easy to put on and keep on."
"Gorgeous, good quality and unique, just as I've come to expect from ShlomitOfir. Thank you so much."
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."

Love. Love. Love. Perfect size.
lovely set if earing for my mum she was very pleased and is excited to wear them thanks üòä
Brilliant product and the presentation was lovely. Comes in its own box which is a great
"Gorgeous, just like the photo so not disappointed, arrived in a beautiful gift box which is a lovely touch. Would highly recommend."
Preciosas! Delicado motivo bot√°nico. Muy favorecedoras. Las compr√© como regalo para mi hija preadolescente y han tenido un gran √©xito :)
"Very happy with my order! The earings are lovely and very good quality. The necklaces are very pretty too, I really love them though I find the chains a little short (especially for the moon necklace which seemed longer on the pictures)."
"These are so pretty and seem like they're good quality! They look great in, and I've gotten tons of compliments. There is another review that rated these as low quality (gave them low stars) because they tried to bend the back hook around to get them into their ears. However I don't think the back is made to do this - I fan-angle them around a bit to get them in my ear and into place without bending the back hook, which is completely possible, it just takes a couple seconds. I love these and would highly recommend them."
I've been looking for Laurel leaf styled earrings for the longest time and these are exactly what I wanted! The design is small but detailed and beautifully made. The back is sturdy too - they were comfortable to wear all week and I never felt like they would fall off. Definitely a favourite!
"These are the second pair of ear crawlers I have purchased. After the quality and comfort of the first I knew I wanted another pair. They are as beautiful in person. This seller has amazing things. If you‚Äôre considering buying, you should, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"Got these for me and my girls for the wedding, they are perfect! Got them in rose gold and silver and they are so pretty and light."
These are so cute! Such a statement piece. I am not big on giant hoops or gaudy jewelry. These are so nice and elegant they go with everything!
"Love these!! Shipped super fast and arrived safe & sound in a cute little bag. I got the rose gold ones colored ones, and they go great with the rest of my rose gold jewelry collection. Thank you!!"
"The owner is fantastic. The item was out of stock, I messaged her about it and she gave a quick reply as to availability along with regular updates about when she would have new stock ready to ship. Really nice and courteous. I have to say my greatest concern going in was that the earring would not be as described/pictured. Now that I've received them I am really impressed. Definitely sterling silver 925. And very dainty and subtle. Really beautiful work by owner, and okay delivery time considering I live in Sydney, Australia. Have been getting so many compliments, will definitely shop here again. Thank you so much."
I am OBSESSED with these!! They are beautiful. The ear jacket is only slightly curved so if you have a very round earlobe like me it won't fit perfectly flush under there but I think it still looks good. Shipping was fast. Thank you!!
"These earring jackets are GORGEOUS. I actually wear the jacket with my own diamond studs and have received many, many compliments on them. They are tiny and sparkly and look like the real thing, not CZs at all. Very pleased!"
"These earrings shipped so fast, arrived in the sweetest packaging with a handwritten thank you note, and are just AWESOME. Exactly as pictured. If you're concerned about the drop length of the earring and if it will fit your earlobe, don't worry- they are adjustable! Great purchase, great shop- will be back for more!"
I love them!!! I love this style so much!!!! Great job!!!!!
"Stunning detail, just an absolutely gorgeous piece!! Worth every penny, nickel, quarter and dime."
"The item shipped really quickly! I love them, they're really detailed!"
"I'm so happy with these earrings, they are absolutely stunning!!"
"They‚Äôre incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don‚Äôt start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don‚Äôt tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they‚Äôre incredible earrings and I‚Äôm so glad I ordered them!"
"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
"This was my second purchase of these earnings as when my daughter saw them she wanted some! They arrived promptly and were beautifully wrapped in recycled material. They are much sturdier than I expected and i have not taken them out since i got my first pair about a month ago which means I have showered, slept and gone swimming with them in (probably not a good idea but I'm lazy about changing my earrings). I love them!"
Super fast delivery and gorgeous product. I love them!
Je suis tr√®s satisfait de cet achat qui est un cadeau pour ma s≈ìur. Le bijou m‚Äôa √©t√© envoy√© tr√®s rapidement (malgr√© les conditions actuelles) et les contacts ont √©t√© tr√®s agr√©ables. La qualit√© est superbe et conforme aux attentes. C‚Äôest fin et c‚Äôest tr√®s joli. Je recommande !
"Love my necklace. It's perfect. Definitely get one. Everywhere I go, people ask about it. ü•∞"
I loved it! I get so many compliments ü•∞
"Bijoux tr√®s joli ! La longueur correspond exactement √† mes attentes, le cristal est vraiment magnifique, le fil tr√®s discret et l'attache nickel ! Je ne peux que recommander ! La cr√©atrice et vendeuse est tr√®s attentionn√©e."
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. Thank you, Jen!"
"Beautifully made, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. I will definitely buy more"
Beautiful earrings and the maker was very helpful and quick to respond.
I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice. The hammered details are absolutely lovely too."

International shipping a little delayed because of COVID-19 and the holidays but WORTH THE WAIT! I can't believe how fine and delicate these are. They glisten and these look and feel handcrafted with love. Highly recommend!
"These are exactly what I was hoping for! Love them, and love the sizing options...they fit me perfectly!"
"Exactly as pictured, beautiful in person :) Love them!"
Very cute and unique!
"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response."
These earrings are beautiful! They look amazing! The overseas shipping was really fast too. Thank you.
Super cute! It took kind of a long time to get here but it was worth the wait!
I love the look and style. Well made and worth the wait.
I LOVE these earrings!!! They‚Äôre so cute and go with a variety of outfits/styles.
Love them!
"Love, love these earrings! They came in a simple and elegant box and tissue, ready as Christmas presents. They arrived on time with no problems. The earrings are beautifully created, simple and elegant in design. The amethyst gives them a colorful touch. Beautiful work. Thank you!"
"Good quality earrings, very elegant and arrived in good time. My only criticism is the presentation - they came just in a card sleeve.. So now I have to find a nice box to present them in. Apart from that, very happy. Thanks"
"I love this Ear Rings they are so beautiful! Thank you for your Service! Sincerely Yours, Catharina Hassid"
"I love my super chic ear pin climbers. They are well-made, and were packed so sweetly. I'm a regular LITTIONARY customer and will continue to be after this purchase!"
Love these! They are very dainty and a perfect for my second holes. Different and subtle. I slept in them even. Very comfortable. I'll be back for more styles! Thanks!
They are small and absolutely perfect. Exactly what I was looking for when I don't want to clash wearing silver and gold jewelry (I hate doing that). They shipped extremely fast!

Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
Trop mignonnes !
"Si d√©licates, fines et jolies!"
These are beautiful! The seller was amazing and happy to make custom alterations. Wow.
"So comfortable and its perfect size!!! So pretty, too!"
Unique.
Pictures gave excellent idea of how it would look in ear. Easy to put on and all day comfortable. Love how it looks.

"Gorgeous, just like the photo so not disappointed, arrived in a beautiful gift box which is a lovely touch. Would highly recommend."
"Stunning, just stunning. Almost 20 years ago I saw my first ear climber and thought it was the prettiest thing I had ever seen. It has taken me this long to purchase a pair. Again, I'm in love. I will definitely buy more ear climbers! Thank you for an awesome product!"
"These earrings are gorgeous! I find I have to adjust them quite a bit on my ears, but this is only because I have very small earlobes! It does not make me love them ANY LESS!! I will continue to wear them, and they are seriously so stunning on!!"
They look absolutely beautiful!! My girlfriend loved them and when I asked the vendor for tracking as the order took maybe 13-14 days to get here she responded in less than 24 hours. Like I said shipping took awhile but it‚Äôs still 5 stars as usps is fucked right now and that‚Äôs not the vendors fault. Would definitely buy from this vendor again!
The opal earrings are gorgeous! They sparkle so much! I will definitely buy more!
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
This is so pretty! The earring fits perfectly in my tragus and the flat back is easy to put it and remove. I requested a custom length and Rosec Jewels was able to accommodate. Very happy with the purchase!
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!

Beautiful piece. Thank you so much.
"These earrings are absolutely stunning! Quality craftsmanship and even more gorgeous in person. I am not one to leave reviews, but this earrings were totally worth the wait. I am so delighted with this purchase and this seller! I loved all the little details in the packaging too. It is obvious that the Artikats truly cares about the details from start to finish."
"Love it! Just got one side, so I can use some of my other singles on the other ear. :)"
I love these! They are very unique and well made. I just placed another order for the Leaf Climbers and matching ring. Love this shop!
Very lovely. I had them resized and they turned out beautiful. The delivery was fast too. :-)
The seller is very nice. I love the earrings so much. They are very beautiful and in perfect condition. Secured package and fast delivery. Thank you so much! Will come back to shop again!
Love the beads. Very light amber. It was fun looking forward to getting them and very fun getting them. Now I am combining some of the large beads with another string of yellow amber beads and it is looking good. Best Wishes to you always Natalie. You light up the universe with Joy.
"Beautiful lace and even more than expected, thank you very much!"
Beautiful brooch. Perfectly packaged. Thanks!
Very cute and unique earrings!
Very pretty. My daughter loved them.
Very cute and very comfortable!
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
"Received my earrings very quickly, as promised. I love them."
"Very happy, earrings are beautiful, wish I had ordered a pair for myself. Good communication and shipping."
"This is second pair I have bought, first were a gift, this pair for me. Beautiful earrings."
They are beautiful. Sit perfectly against the ear. Super quick delivery. Very happy with purchase.
"GORGEOUS! I can't say enough good things about these ear crawlers. I bought them to wear in my second piercing hole along with a pair of gorgeous raw pearl drop earrings that match these to a tee. Shipping was quick, and they were delivered in the cutest package."
I love these so much!! So beautiful and well made. I get so many compliments whenever I wear them. Excellent customer service too üòäThank you so much!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ú®
I would totally recommend this shop and seller! The sellers (Tiffany and Micah) are two of the nicest sellers on etsy and very attentive to my order! I bought my earrings during the holidays and it was shipped fast and it arrived even faster. The moonstone earrings are beautiful and very well-made. They are delicate and feminine yet very sturdy. The stones and metal are of the best quality.
"Tiffany is amazing- communicative, helpful and even made me a smaller earring to accommodate my tiny ears hahaha. The earrings are so beautiful and I get tons of compliments on them! Thank you Tiffany!! üíé"
They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product... sherry
"These are beautiful and so unique. I didn‚Äôt realize quite how the back went, and worried that it might slide around but when it came I realized the worry was unneeded. They are so cool, and I get tons of compliments on them."
They are stunning I‚Äôm obsessed!
Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!
Absolutely love these gorgeous earrings - they are simply perfect. I chose pink and orange and the colour combination is beautiful. They are really different and I plan to order more. The packaging is also really cool! Delighted with this purchase and the seller was extremely helpful too - very happy!
Love them üß° ‚ú®
"These earrings are so unusual, they look even prettier in real life. The seller was very helpful, delivery was very quick and I'll definitely be ordering more of these in different colours."
"My mom loves these shooting star earrings. Also, the package arrived quickly (from the UK) in spite of all the challenges folks are facing with these days - thank you so much and appreciate your effort!!"
Best jewelry ever! I love this look. I get sooo many compliments. I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers. I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful. I sleep in them too no problem. Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.
"Love them! Simple, something I can wear everyday to add a little touch. Especially since Covid, I‚Äôve been wearing absolutely no jewelry/earrings. So I like that I can look nice without being over the top. Definitely want these in the gold."
these are so cool!! i've been looking for some unique gold pieces to change up my ear jewelry and this is exactly what i was looking for. easy to put in and look very nice!
"I had such a great experience with the owner! She's so sweet and considerate. The original earring was too long, so she was willing to ship me a new earring with a shorter length. I highly recommend this store to anyone. I never leave reviews, but she just went above and beyond!"
"These earrings are stunning!! I have quite small ears, so the bottom jewel doesn‚Äôt sit close to my ear but it looks cute despite! I was so glad these earrings are true to being ‚Äòdainty‚Äô as these were the perfect size for my tiny ears! Will buy from again in futureüíú"
"Very pretty earrings that match exactly with my ear! The crystals are really shimmery, definitely recommend!"
"Came well packaged with my wee 3 stone triangular studs. Discreet, pretty and versatile. They go with just about anything. Thank you."
"¬°Preciosos, finos y elegantes! Han sido un regalo de Navidad para mi sobrina, y no se los ha vuelto a quitar :)"
"I have ordered a pair of ear climbers from this artist before, was only ordering for the left ear this time to mismatch with the moonstone studs I also ordered, but Ara sent me both left and right climbers... so sweet! These climbers are fabulous and with a little bit of practice they become easy to put on. Beautifully made."
"I orders two earrings and here is the picture for ones with dragonfly. The mono phrases- They are just damn great! It looks like Ara has worked on customer issues as the handles on my earrings seem superb (does not seem at all like they are going to come off as I read in some previous reviews). One seems to be a bit tight and hurts the ear if is kept too long, but I will just adjust the handle carefully, it should do the trick. In general they are a bit different from what I imagined and I am very hard to please client and do not leave 5 stars in general, but this item is really good and has the subtle ornamented silver that gives other qualities. Comes with a cute bottle that I was happy to receive even if the earrings did not fit so Ara added extra packaging. And a nice polishing cloth too. Thank you and good luck!"
"I LOVE them!!! Shipping took some time but that is to be expected since they came from the Manila, Philippines and I live in the USA. It was defiantly worth the wait!"
These ear climbers are even more gorgeous in person. They are worth the wait. Thank You
This worked perfectly in my cartilage piercing! I am so happy with the design :)
"Super unique design, love it!!!"
Just as beautiful as pictured!
Very cute earrings!! Love them!!
"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop ü•∞, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again üòÅ"
Just arrived 3 minutes ago. Wow! Just beautiful! Many thanks. Constance
Magnifique... un rendu au top. Ce bijou va vite devenir une pi√®ce phare de ma collection ! ‚ú®
My wife loved these earrings!! High quality work and even more beautiful in person.
"I just received the cuff earring. It‚Äôs dainty and beautiful! So pleased. Highly recommend. Working from home, so nice to get this package delivered today from Israel!"
"Amazing! Such sparkle and so very comfortable. It's elegant, sexy, and fun all at once. Very well made and seller is wonderful to communicate with; it also arrived practically overnight - Thank You!"
Love my ring exactly what I wanted. Super fast work & shipping.
The necklace is beautiful! I received it in no time. Service was impeccable and just perfect. Best Xmas gift.
Even prettier in person and arrived super fast. Liked them so much that I bought another pair of earrings in a different color
"Lovely earrings! They are delicate, very elegant and so original, though a bit smaller than expected. They come in their own little box. I get hundreds of compliments when wearing them!"
"Just beautiful! More than I could have hoped for. Be aware if shopping from UK there is a customs duty to pay, but they are worth it!"
Thank you so much for all the amazing pieces.
"I ordered these lotus jacket earrings is silver and rose gold. I. Am. Obsessed! I constantly get compliments! Get yourself a pair, you will not regret it!"
"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."
"They‚Äôre exactly as described! SO PERFECT, I‚Äôm obsessed. It was delivered so quickly too in protective packaging."
I‚Äôm in love with the earrings! Exactly like the picture and you can take off the lotus part whenever you want and just wear the stud.
"I had not considered a pair of ear climbers before spotting these... something about the shape in the photo just spoke to me, and they are every bit as beautiful in reality. I have a fairly neutral skin tone but tend to wear silver. I bought these in the hammered gold because I reckoned this would give a softer glow of gold, which it does (and it was an occasion for spoiling myself). They feel superb in the hand and look gorgeous on. More of a subtle and elegant touch than a statement piece, I know I am going to get loads of use from them. They shipped much faster than promised too."
These are even more beautiful in person. I got two pairs. One yellow gold (left) and one white gold (right). Both hammered. The hammered effect makes the light hit them at different angles and gives them a little sparkle. They can be dressed up or down. The shop owner is amazing and communication is fantastic! Highly recommend!
I wore these beautiful earrings for my wedding and they were perfect. She made sure I had them in time and I received so many compliments. I love that I will definitely wear them over and over too. Can be dressed up or dressed down!
"High quality, arrived fast, SO cute in person. Perfectly dainty, sophisticated and unique. I wear them everyday and get tons of compliments. They're my new favorite pair of earrings! :) Thanks MUKA."
IN LOVE! These are so flipping cute and I get so many compliments!
"Earrings are absolutely beautiful and Inali was so incredibly sweet and accommodating when the US postal serviced seemed to misplace my package. She runs a fantastic shop and I highly recommend supporting her work. Thanks again, Inali! xx much love."
Loved these earrings!
Lovely simple design.. Will wear often. Long time to ship and slight imperfections in silver coating.. but overall very nice. Thanks!
"These are super cute, fit nicely, are easy to use, and got lots of compliments! The packing was safe, and the shipping was very fast. When I had a question about the item, the store owner replied very promptly. Be advised that the two ""jacket"" sections are textured on the same side (not mirror-images of each other), so when you flip one to wear it, they are slightly different. Also, the earrings I received look more like gold cylinders (about 3mm high) rather than the dimpled, button-like ones in the photo. This was totally fine for me, and I am very happy with my purchase, but if you have questions about the set, just ask the seller! She's very friendly and quick to get back with you. Overall, I love this set and feel pretty wearing it. :)"
"These are so fun!! They are definitely big which means they don't pair easily with other large earrings, but if you're buying them to be the statement piece (which is what I did), then they are perfection! Definitely my current favorite earrings! And easy to use with a mask!"
"Love these! Have received a lot of compliments on the unique design. The post and circle appears to be a slightly different email material than the petals, but not noticeable from anyone else's perspective."
Love these! First time trying this style and I‚Äôm addicted. These are simple and elegant.
These were beautiful and look real - were beautiful to wear on my wedding day!
Gorgeous!!!! The pictures did them justice and they're perfect for my wedding!!
So cute!! Got a lot of compliments! Easy to put in too and great quality!!
The earrings I bought looked exactly like the picture and are beautiful! Seller was quick to answer my question and I got my order quick!
"These are even MORE beautiful in person! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!!!! I can't believe how pretty they are, even in their own simplicity! Thank you so much!"
I absolutely love my new earrings! Dainty and adorable. I get lots of compliments on them. They shipped very quickly and I couldn't be happier! Thank you very much!!!
Sorry no photo but I GET sooooo many compliments on these understated but totally groovy earrings. THX!!
Bought these ear jacket earrings with the lotus studs. They are even more beautiful than the pictures show. Love them!
"These are literally so beautiful. I don't spend very much money on jewelry in general because I tend to lose it, but these just felt so special. They look great and feel great. I can't say enough good things."
"Beautiful piece of jewelry, shipped quickly! And the seller customized the size for me. Definitely recommend!!"
"Holy moly these are cute! Very dainty and different, exactly what I wanted. Seriously quick shipping too. I'll definitely be a return shopper."
"Cute sterling silver earrings that look exactly as pictured! Can swap in different studs, if needed. Peek out from behind the ear the perfect amount."
Love these! Thank you for the upgrade to a better material! I will probably be a repeat customer in the near future :)
"The x is much smaller than the picture suggests. It‚Äôs maybe the size of a pencil eraser. It‚Äôs kind of hard to see. Maybe these models just have tiny faces and ears, but i was expecting the earrings to be larger."
"Fast delivery, great quality. I gave four stars because the earrings is smaller than I understood from the photo. Maybe my ears are big? Very happy with this shop, I recommend it!"
Exactly what I was wanting for my industrial piercing. I even asked to have the earring be a bit longer and my request was granted. Exceptional work for such a minimalist piece. Thank you!!
Just what my daughter wanted!
Simple yet eye-catching and stylish. I work with a lot of people and bountyful has been the praise. I love these too!
"I love these earrings! They're super versatile and can be worn dressy or casual. I also love that I can just wear the main bar only if I want, so it's like getting two pairs in one."
"These are so nice on. First time wearing ear jackets and they were a bit fiddly to get on but practice makes it easier. Really understated, modern look. Love them!"
I love these earrings and have had so many compliments on them. They are different and fun. Shipping was great.
"Muy bonitos, y muy faciles de llevar"
"I wanted a delicate, minimalist, unique pair of earrings to wear on my wedding day. These are perfect! I can't wait to wear them :)"
Such a simple style but also very unique. I get so many compliments on these. Love them! Thank you!
My ear climbers are elegant and a bit sassy. I get lots of compliments. The short climbers are a perfect size for my small ears and are very comfortable to wear. I love them! The international delivery and correspondence was very quick. I'm already trying to work out my next Glamrocks Designs purchase - thank you!
"These are super cute - they were a tiny bit wider than I anticipated but not significantly. Since these were my first pair of ear crawlers it took me a few times to get the hang of putting them in, but I've gotten better at it each time. I've gotten so many compliments on these.. wish I had bought more :)"
Bellissimi orecchini! Spedizione rapida e puntuale!
Beautiful and dainty! I love these!
"Entspricht ganz den Produktbildern, tolle Farbe und Qualit√§t"
"These are very pretty earrings, and the seller is responsive to messages. I instantly had an allergic reaction when putting these on. I have never reacted to sterling silver before."
They are just as described on website. Nice size too. Like the 14kt gold.
"Great product it‚Äôs 14k marked. Great quality, will definitely purchase again."
"This chain is absolutely stunning! It‚Äôs so dainty and delicate and it‚Äôs so brilliantly shiny. I ended up giving my mom the 18‚Äù chain for her mother‚Äôs day gift and I just ordered another 20‚Äù chain for myself. The quality of the product is absolutely amazing and the pricing is unmatched! The seller, Sara, responds to messages quickly and she is so kind! I am a forever customer of OnTheRocksUSA."
"I purchased the necklace in 16in and wanted it to lay right at my collar bone and I got the length perfect. This necklace is so dainty but sparkles and shines so nice and is a very attractive piece to have. I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt let this item sit in my cart. The price was great and the shipping was very quick. I will be wearing this everyday, it feels strong for me to be able to. The necklace I purchased is the top one (and the bottom one is in 19inches just in case you wanted to see the length difference)"
LOVE! Ordered these for my wedding day. Super boho and simple - exactly what I was looking for. Shipped extremely fast and seller was great to work with :)
Very happy with my new earrings! Looks just like the picture. Received it fast.
Muy bonitos. Son mis preferidos para lucir en estas fiestas.
Love the earring and the communication with the shop owner is beyond amazing! Highly recommend for the quality of the pieces she has!
Quality is better than I‚Äôd hoped for. Shipping was incredibly fast. I‚Äôm in love with the look but the ear climber may not lay flat against your ear. Or maybe I just have a weird ear. I still love it. Will definitely be buying more from this seller.
"LOVE THESE! I purchased as a set, order came quickly. Ignore red in photo, I'm still piercing my setup of lining my ears with diamonds. These were a great touch!"
Okay so I‚Äôm obsessed with this earring!!! I had to change the backing in order to have it lay flat on my ear comfortably. I have sensitive ears and couldn‚Äôt tighten the original backing too much. It‚Äôs perfect!
"I love these earrings so much, I had to purchase 2 full sets to get this look. (My ears match)WORTH IT. Customer service is amazing, and items came very fast. When I am ready to add more diamonds, this is where I will purchase!"
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"The earrings are exactly what I wanted. I needed amethyst ones which the seller was able to accommodate. I would 100% recommend jewelry from this seller. The earrings are beautiful, and I was also able to use the studs for my engagement pictures."
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
These earrings are simply gorgeous and more than I could have hoped for. I definitely will be buying more from Miriam!
Perfect! Looks amazing on my giant earlobes and my daughter's nearly no lobes.
"These have been my favorite purchase on Etsy so far! They are absolutely stunning and I get compliments all the time when I wear them. They look to be very high quality, not cheaply made. You will not be disappointed!"
The most amazing Jewellery. So original and Edgy. Lots of people admire these amazing pieces
"These are amazing earrings! Mine are even better looking than the photo! The quality of craftsmanship is excellent, and the style looks great on the ears! These are my favorite jewelry purchase ever, from anywhere, aside from my wedding ring ;)"
Such quick shipping! Love I get to wear such cool earrings on my very sensitive ears! They are soooo well made!
These are so cute! I love them. They are well made and I received compliments :)
These earrings are stunning! I cannot wait to order again from this shop. Beautifully crafted - a true work of art.
Les boucles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√© Merci
"Exactly as described and pictured. The seller was prompt to respond to my questions, make the bracelet, and ship my order. I am very happy with the quality of the materials and craftsmanship. I love this bracelet that I had made to celebrate my son's birth."
"Tr√®s belle bague, fine et raffin√©e. Un vrai travail de cr√©atrice et de joaillerie, qui conserve la beaut√© des mat√©riaux brut. Je suis tr√®s contente de mon choix."
"I just adore everything about this cool ring. Awesome design, really beautiful tourmaline with so many shades of forest green. I love the vibes of this gorgeous ring... A million thanks to a very talented artist!"
BEAUTIFUL earrings! I love these earrings so much! I wore them in my wedding and received so many compliments. The sparkles were gorgeous. I technically didn't wear them as intended with the climbing style because I realized that personally I have pretty small ears and when I put them on as so the earrings kind of flared out. So I switched sides with the earrings and allowed them to hang down. They were beyond expectations and SO beautiful. I would highly recommend these earrings and shop to anyone looking for the perfect amount of sparkle and beauty!
I wore these as MOH at my friend's wedding. Absolutely loved them!
The earrings are amazing!! I love them. Great quality. I wanted them in silver rather than gold and they were made exactly as I requested.
The earrings are really lovely! Looks exactly like on the pic even more beautifully!. I am really happy that I chose them. Thank you ! :)
"I LOVE these ear jackets! As soon as they arrived, I switched out what I was wearing for these, and I've barely taken them off since! They are very well made, and I just love the look. I measured my ears to ensure these would fit (well, I had a helper). They sometimes fit a little longer than pictured, but if I push the bottom against my ear, they look as pictured. Either way is great - don't hesitate! Virginia, thanks for making these for me!"
"Beautiful handmade earrings. My earlobes are kind of small so the ball spheres hang down a little lower than shown in the picture, but they are really cool anyway. The seller kept in touch with me about shipping when the wait was a little longer than expected. Thanks!"
"I absolutely love Virginia's designs - they are simple, elegant, striking, and unique all at once. I purchased several pairs of earrings because I just couldn't pick a favorite. I cannot wear any of them without getting compliments. I'm sure I'll treat myself with more her beautiful pieces in the future and will recommend this shop to anyone who asks in the meantime. Thanks so much!"
Fab!
"Magnifique boucles d'oreilles, livraison rapide, parfait:)"
Elles sont parfaite! D√©licate merci pour la qualit√© du produit.
"Got it for a friend for her birthday, she loved it! Will definitely be purchasing from this store in the future."
"Absolutely perfect as our engagement rings. The seller was beyond wonderful, communicating every step of the way and just being so sweet and supportive. They fit beautifully, the mix of gold and silver creates a unique kind of warmth, and they‚Äôre completely comfortable to wear. We honestly couldn‚Äôt be happier. Very sincerely recommend this wonderful artist for high quality jewellery and perfect customer service üíú thank you so much."
Custom necklace Ali made.for me with kuem boo gold on some of the silver nuggets. I left the choice.of which nuggets to accent up to her... The effect is breathtaking (pic does not do them justice)! The necklaces are totally separate so can be worn together or individually/various combos. I got the combination of lengths pictured.on the model. Bc the two longer ones don't have a clasp suggest being careful putting them on as the medium just makes it over my head LOL.
What an amazing ring. Absolutely beautiful and a perfect fit. I love the flash of gold on silver. It's everything I wanted in a ring. It's definitely a statement piece. I love it. Thank you so much.
"Dans une tr√®s jolie bo√Æte, j‚Äôai d√©couvert ces tr√®s belles boucles d‚Äôoreilles, tr√®s bien proportionn√©es, aux formes harmonieuses, fines et tr√®s originales. Merci et f√©licitations Ali."
absolutely love my earrings they‚Äôre beautiful! I‚Äôm usually super allergic but I can‚Äôt even feel these. Also arrived really quickly üíì
love these so much!!
Love!
"Really dainty and elegant, really love these! My first ever pair of earrings! Shipped quickly and arrived before expected date."
"Wow! I ordered this diamond sun ray‚òÄÔ∏èring in rose gold. I thought I would wear it on my pointer finger as an accent for showier rings on my actual ring finger. Wrong! This is a STATEMENT ring! An absolute stunner! ü§© It is gorgeous, and .31 ctw of diamonds is actually a lot of diamonds for this setting. The ring is super sparkly and definitely draws attention.üåü From a practical perspective, you should be aware that the sun rays that extend out horizontally (at the base of the ring) are pretty long. In my photo, you can see they actually extend out a bit past the width of my finger. Because of that, I won‚Äôt be wearing this ring while playing the piano or being active, but man, what a gorgeous piece! ü§ó"
"OMG, these earrings are sooooooo bada$$!!! I searched high and low for a triple spike earring and am thrilled to finally have found these through Etsy. I ordered a 10 mm, 14 k gold pair. The quality is unreal. They are solid gold and feel very sturdy and the clasp feels very secure. The polish is beautiful too! So shiny! Honestly, they exceeded my expectations. I have never written a review on Etsy before this one, but this item deserves it and more! I can not praise them enough‚Äì‚Äì‚Äìboth product and seller‚Äìtop-notch. Look no further. You will not be disappointed!"
"Wow. These are definitely better quality than I expected. I custom ordered these with a 5mm bar and they are perfect for my thin ears. I'm glad, because these have weight to them and would easily sag if they were not snug fitting. The screw on these is long and goes all the way into the ball. Very secure but remember that new piercings do not like externally threaded anything. I highly recommend these. The stones are exactly the same as my moonstone pendant (my birthstone). I love yellow gold jewelry with my warm skin tone and these seriously go with almost everything I have. Pictured are just a few examples. They also blend beautifully with my opal hoops. They are not cheap but you are getting what you pay for here. I was pleasantly surprised. I will update if they tarnish or fall apart, but I am definitely not expecting it."
"Super pretty with a touch of fierce. I got the 10mm and it's a perfect, snug fit in my lowest lobe piercing."
"Ganz liebevoll gestaltete, hochwertige Schmuckst√ºcke! Selbst in der Verpackung und den Infos zu den einzelnen Teilen (inklusive Silberputztuch) steckt Arbeit dahinter. Der Versand war flott und auch der Kontakt total nett. Bestelle bestimmt wieder ü§© Vielen Dank!!"
Superliebe Verk√§uferin und die Ohrringen sind ein Traum:-) Sogar die Verpackung ist toll und wahnsinnig liebevoll gestaltet! Kann den Shop zu 100% empfehlen!!!
Die Ear Crawler sind total Klasse und super schnelle Lieferung. Werde auf jeden Fall wieder vorbei schaun.
"Perfect earrings, well made, good quality. The only point is excessive packaging, I would prefer to receive all buckets and letters electronically."
"La qualit√© des bagues sont top ! La livraison a √©t√© super rapide, et l‚Äôemballage est super mignon !! Je recommande"
"GemAndZen was recommended to me as a store by a friend, I discovered an incredible world. today my wonderful shamanic drum arrived in Italy in a very short time, perfectly packed. Drum vibrations are magical as well as being beautiful and well done! thanks Michel for your kindness and professionalism. This is just the first of a long series of things that I will buy!!! ü•Å‚ú®merci ‚ú®"
"El√©gant et raffin√©. J'aime beaucoup! C'est un cadeau mais je recommanderai pour moi. De plus, livraison tr√®s rapide, ce qui est tr√®s agr√©able, particuli√®rement en d√©cembre!"
"Exactly as pictured, I got the pink ombre one. Luckily it arrived safely in one piece, but I feel that it could have been wrapped a little more carefully."
"J'ai achet√© des boucles d'oreilles cerises, elles sont tr√®s belles! Merci √† Fran√ßoise pour son beau travail!"
The earrings are just as pictured - Beautiful!
"Achet√©es pour un cadeau, je n'ai pas regrett√© mon coup de coeur, belle couleur, pas trop imposantes elles se font n√©anmoins remarquer. Merci √©galement pour l'emballage cadeau soign√© et les petites attentions, l'exp√©dition rapide, et le cadeau a fait mouche, je n'en doutais pas. Une bonne adresse du Nord de la France qui vaut le d√©tour ! Bravo et encore merci Fran√ßoise !"
Petit cadeau qui a bcp plu √† mon amie. Je recommande...
These are absolutely beautiful. I have received so many compliments. Well made jewelry. Beautifully packaged. Will definitely buy again. I already have my eye on some other items from CaitlynMinimalist. üòä
"I love these!!! Great customer service, too."
I‚Äôm not sure how to get these earrings to stay on !
The necklace is perfect! I put 3 initials and hearts in between each one. It came packaged in an adorable box too! I will definitely be recommending this shop to my friends.
"I got these earrings for my wedding day. I tried them out during my bachelorette and found them very uncomfortable, but realized it was because had tightened the little knob on top too tight. I wore them for my wedding day, from 11AM to 12AM, and let me say I didn‚Äôt even feel them (I tightened the knob the right amount that time). Everyone loved them so much! They are beyond gorgeous and so edgy. I got the pair so my mom and I could each wear one. I‚Äôve kept on using them for outings and everyone is always complimenting me on them! Arrived within a couple of weeks, which is a plus! Love them!"
I purchased the crystal and emerald ear crawl earrings for my daughter to wear on her wedding day in September. They're beautiful and she loves them. It took some time to receive them from Israel but they did come sooner than predicted.
"Stunning earring, we are a shop that start work with Maya Valentino, the quality and service is great! Thank you Tommy!!"
Absolutely beautiful!
The photos don‚Äôt do any justice to the earrings! The are drop dead gorgeous! Super fast shipping!
"Beautiful earrings! I haven't tried them on (they're a gift), but they are prettier in person - picture doesn't show them off nearly enough!"
"My package got switched up in the mail, Cathy was super friendly and got it straightened out right away. The earrings are beautiful and well made!"
So pretty! Many compliments. Fast communication and shipping by seller üåûüíï
The seller was extremely pleasant and easy to work with. They answered all my questions. I was confused by the shipping but it came at a good time. Thanks!
Want them in silver too now!
Loved the look online. Just think it's over priced for the quality of product that arrived. My backing fell off before I could even get to wear the earrings.
"These came fast in the mail, but they don't stay up on my ears like they were shown in the photo because they're too heavy :("
Super cute and super dainty! I‚Äôm always afraid it‚Äôs going to break though because it does get bendy very easily. Also! This was by far the fastest shipping I have received from an Etsy shop! Thank you!!
Shipping was FAST. Very fast. My order shipped the very next day after purchase. The star ear climbers are so cute! They‚Äôre my new daily wear. And the feather charm is perfect for my charm bracelet. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è will def order again.
I love it!
I LOVE this star earrings but the back push is I guess not fitting enough because they‚Äôve fallen out of my ears twice already üò≠ so I have purchased it for 3 times now because they‚Äôre so cute! So make sure to change the back push with something that fits
"I love these earrings!!!! At first they didn't stay in a climbing position but that's because I got the 7 stone climbers and my upper ears are both thin and narrow. I have issues with all climbers because of my ears. I worked with the store and she was amazing to work with. Margay walked me through how to adjust them and they work!!! They stay in a climbing position! I love these earrings, great quality, super great customer service and fast shipping. Will be purchasing from this shop again for certain."
"This shop is AMAZING!! The original climbers were about 2 stones too big, and they offered to make me a new set with 2 less stones. And now they are PERFECT!! I will definitely buy more items from this shop because they obviously care about the happiness of their customers. Thank you so much for being so awesome!!!!!"
I am obsessed with these!! Thank you SO much! üí´üí´üí´
"Love love love my custom ear climbers! Super helpful shop. Wonderful customer service, and beautiful product. Many thanks!"
I bought the rose cold constellation earrings as a birthday gift for my sister and she absolutely loved them. Sophia also answered all of my questions promptly and was very accommodating. I also received the earring sooner than expected. Very happy with my purchase :)
Beautiful earrings!! They look even more amazing in person! Very fast shipping! Will certainly be ordering more :)

"I love it!...might want to pierce the left just to wear another one of these. Just a suggestion, maybe a shorter post with a smoother/screw clasp...but still love what I got!"
"I absolutely LOVE this item! I've been looking for a more fun item for my cartilage piercing and j have finally found it. Great material. Very awesome artist too- I goofed and ordered the left earring when I needed the right, and she was so open to the exchange and it was super easy. Thanks Melanie!!"
"Beautiful earring, very well made. I had to send back to get the post moved down to sit better in my ear. Melanie was more than happy to fix my earring. She was fast with applying to message and fast shipping. I will definitely be ordering more jewelry from her"
The package is wonderful and thoughtful. This cartilage earring is by far the best earring i bought. It is not heavy and it looks good. Thank you
"For the second year in a row, I purchased earrings from OSingulierBoutique, the pieces inspired by the tiny Greek islands of Amorgos (last year's purchase) and Koufonissia , (this year's purchase) - both places which we visit on our trips back 'Home' to Greece. The pieces are made well, durable, look beautiful, and best of all: They truly do remind us of our favorite places. The deep turquoise blue and gold in the Amorgos piece clearly take inspiration of the island, it's so obvious I can envision it. The same for the bright blue/greens of the Koufonissia piece! the color of the Aegean Sea hitting the beach, and the bright white golden color of the sand are spot on. If a Patmos inspired piece is made, we'll take it!"
"Bijoux cr√©atifs de toutes sortes, de toutes formes, mati√®res eclectiques. Tr√®s agr√©ables √† porter, finit magnifiquement une tenue. De plus j'adore la fermeture de celles-ci. On en redemande toujours plus, jamais rassasi√© car beaucoup de renouvellement. Vite allez y !!!!"
BO Magnfiques encore plus jolies en vrai que sur la photo. Je les ai offertes et elles ont fait un tabac. Envoi rapide et soign√©. Communication tr√®s facile avec la vendeuse.
"J ai re√ßu mes boucles d oreilles tr√®s rapidement. Sur photo, elles √©taient tr√®s jolies, en r√©alit√©, elles le sont davantage. Tr√®s l√©g√®res, color√©es, tr√®s bien emballees et avec go√ªt! J adore!! Merci"
"These are my absolute favorite pair of earings!!! I love them and have gotten so many compliments on them!!! The packaging was so beautiful as well, I wish I could post noimore photos. You won't regret ordering these beauties!!"
"I received so many compliments on my earrings and recommended this store to all of my friends. The design is modern, chic and dainty at the same time. Great quality from a local business (I discovered upon receipt just how close we are!) :-)"
Really love my new earrings. I love that they are light weight! I contacted the seller and she was quick to answer my questions and even added in some care instructions. Super happy and highly recommend.
My new fav earrings! I love how you can mix and match and swap them around with other earrings for different looks.
Amazing! Perfect for my geology/petroleum engineering major! She loves them. Arrived from Maylasia 2 days after shipping. Couldn't believe it
Love love love love love!!!!
so beautiful im in love with both pairs of ear climbers. thank u so much I will be ordering from here again! thank u for dealing with me and my crazy ü§™a**..lol
These are beautiful! I get lots of compliments. They are so comfortable in your ears. They look gorgeous up or down. Iwill be buying more from this shop.
"These ear climbers are perfect. They do have a little weight to them. If they slip, follow the instructions given on how to secure them on your ear lobes. They are so beautiful, I wear them all the time! Shipping was fast and secure. Will order from this shop again."
Loved it!!
Was just what I wanted. Very delicate. I am receiving so many compliments!!
"I love my new ear climbers! They came in a lovely little package, tied with a bow! They are beautifully made!"
"Beautiful craftsmanship, they look just like the photos! I'm finding it a bit uncomfortable to put them in my ears, but I guess that probably just takes some practice (this is my first pair of ear climbers). They were carefully packaged and shipped quite fast. All in all, I would buy from this seller again. :)"
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! Took me a bit to get them in place the first time and adjusted to my ears but now they sit comfortably and are a breeze to put in. I would highly recommend them!
Love these! Not gaudy and adds interest to studs. Light and move beautifully
"Amazing packaging, very creative and eco friendly. These jackets are great for wearing with any studs, haven't tried them slipped onto climbers yet but I can see them being amazing for that as well. Very tempted to get the longer pair as well."
I really like these. I would be interested in similar items with more/longer strands.
Bought these for my daughter and she's thrilled with them. I have to admit they do look good and will add variety to her ordinary studs. Thanks Tanglemoss.
"Love this ear crawler and all my pieces from Vintage Acorn. Well crafted, friendly seller and was able to pick up at my convenience!"
My wife loved these. They‚Äôre easier to put on than other ear climbers and look great.
Love these earrings! They are the perfect size. Also shipping was incredibly quick!
Exactly as pictured! Great presentation- small package took a bit of time due to the pandemic affecting shipping (but to be expected). I‚Äôm stoked.
The photos don‚Äôt do any justice to the earrings! The are drop dead gorgeous! Super fast shipping!
"Beautiful earrings! I haven't tried them on (they're a gift), but they are prettier in person - picture doesn't show them off nearly enough!"
"My package got switched up in the mail, Cathy was super friendly and got it straightened out right away. The earrings are beautiful and well made!"
So pretty! Many compliments. Fast communication and shipping by seller üåûüíï
"Love these! I was a little nervous by looking at them that they‚Äôd be hard to put in, but that‚Äôs not the case at all. They are delicate and pretty and I forgot I actually had them in until I got complimented several times!"
"These climbers are stunning! Very lightweight sterling silver too! I don't feel as though they would slip down my ear at all! Very happy with my purchase, thank you üòä"
Beautiful ear clips!! Very satisfied!
"Truly beautiful, came quickly. Thanks!"
"Product received in a reasonable amount of time. Seller was cordial and let me know when they were likely to ship. Shipping and tracking information accurate. Product the size indicated with good detail. Despite the size they have a little noticeable weight which is often a good sign. Good quality, fits well, and sits better. I recommend this one!"
They are so pretty I absolutely love them can‚Äôt wait to wear them soon ü¶ã
"This ring is absolutely beautiful! Packaged professionally, and the shipping was extremely fast! Customer service was top notch, can‚Äôt say enough great things about this experience. I will definitely be purchasing more jewelry from this shop!"
The items were amazing üëè. I love butterflies ü¶ãso it was just what I was looking for.
"This was my first pair of ear climbers and I love them! I'm in the states so it did take close to a month to arrive, but worth the wait."
Gorgeous! She loved them. She went to the restroom at the restaurant to put them in. Great quality! Very sturdy but feminine!
Love them I haven‚Äôt taken them off!!
Magnifiques boucles d‚Äôoreilles! Trop contente de mon achat ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Very cool!! I wish my ears were still pierced as I would have kept them for myself!! Thank You
Beautifully crafted. Shipping was fast and well packaged. Thanks for great work and lovely ear sweeps.
Lots of compliments! Great product!
Smooth transaction. Love them so much.
"Earrings are so much more pretty in person. Excellent seller with good communication. I‚Äôm happy, thank you :)"
I have come to admire this very different style of earring. Quite stunning in person. I purchased to coordinate with the equally gorgeous Sapphire Blue bracelet in this order. High quality creation.
"wow! all I can say is these are wonderfull. I tried them on and my twin sister went screaming to her computer to see what else you guys have. love,love love them"
"Previous ratings were right, even more stunning in person. Lovely stones, lovely craftsmanship."
perfect wedding shower gift for the bride for her honeymoon
"Exceeding my expectation. Perfect size, good quality, with a replaceable filter, a nicely-knitted bag, and a heartwarming note of thanks! I have been looking for facemasks with world map pattern. This is definitely one of the best. Love it."
Wurde als Geschenk bestellt und gleich zum Empf√§nger versendet. Unkompliziert und zuverl√§ssig. Macht weiter so!
very impressed with the quality
Je suis tr√®s satisfait de cet achat qui est un cadeau pour ma s≈ìur. Le bijou m‚Äôa √©t√© envoy√© tr√®s rapidement (malgr√© les conditions actuelles) et les contacts ont √©t√© tr√®s agr√©ables. La qualit√© est superbe et conforme aux attentes. C‚Äôest fin et c‚Äôest tr√®s joli. Je recommande !
"Love my necklace. It's perfect. Definitely get one. Everywhere I go, people ask about it. ü•∞"
I loved it! I get so many compliments ü•∞
"Love my ear crawlers! Beautiful craftsmanship! Shipped fast! Definitely will buy more sets. Just back from NGO work in Kenya, where sadly I lost my left beautiful climber. Have just reordered a new leftie. Can‚Äôt stand to be without a complete set!"
"These are beautiful!! I‚Äôve received so many wonderful compliments and everyone wants to know where I got them. They‚Äôre subtle but striking, really comfortable and came at such a fantastic price. Thank you!"
I am IN love with this gold crawler. It looks MUCH daintier on a larger ear and head but it's so unique and lovely. The LONG shipping time was worth it. I love this
"These ear climbers are simply stunning! They can accessorize both casual and formal outfits, adding an elegant edge. Shipping was very quick (much quicker than I expected). I also purchased ear cuffs from this shop. They look delicate, but are well-made and again lend some fun and edge to any outfit."
"SUPER nice, I wear them all day every day, I have to readjust them sometimes, they sometimes hang feom my ear and sometimes I shove them more towards the inside of my ear, wich hurts after a while, but this is how they naturally are on my ear (see pic) and I don‚Äòt even feel them. They are absolutelly beatiful. I Love Them! And should they ever break, I‚Äòll order them again from this seller! And they are sterling silver! I know because I am allergic to cheep (unreal) jewelry. So super good! Thanks!"
"Fantastic seller - I bought several items and they are all amazing, right down to the gorgeous packaging. These people really care about their product and even included a jewellery cleaning cloth, and a special bag for the lariat necklace. I couldn't be happier with this awesome purchase, thank you!"
"Great customer service! Bolts are a little difficult to get on, but look super cute!"
"I am so glad to find ear climbers. I can't wear dangling earrings at work and these are perfect, not to mention quirky. I love the way they look and are made. Very simple to put on. Can't wait to order more, Catherine"
"Gorgeous!! I was worried these beauties would not fit my ear shape very well because I don‚Äôt have very rounded earlobes... but I wanted to take the chance because I love the classy, minimalist look of them. They look GREAT! Take a chance, you prob love them too! Shipping was super fast, even though it was international. And the owner of the shop is so kind and gives great customer service! Gracias!!!"
Me han encantado!! han llegado el pedido perfecto y con mucha rapidez! Repetir√©!!
"I received the Silver ball ear jacket earrings. They are very well made and sturdy. The posts were fine, not too thick. And something else noteworthy is that the back part where the balls hang is adjustable. So if you're piercing hole is closer to the bottom of your ear lobe, you can adjust the back part so it doesn't hang too low. Beautiful!!"
Looove!
"It was packaged nice and was delivered to me in a timely manner. The 925 Silver is shiny and very beautiful. However, I do think that these specific ones don't compliment my ear shape very well. They also would slide off my ear occasionally throughout my day when I would wear them. *5 stars for the fast shipping, reasonable prices, and secure packaging. Definitely looking forward to trying out some other styles of earrings and ear climbers from this shop in the future."
Looove them!!
"Wow, these ear climbers are so beautiful in person! They're elegant and better than I expected. They're also incredibly light so you don't notice you're wearing them. You can sleep in them, shower in them, etc., and they stay securely in place. Also, the shipping was super fast. Thank you!"
Shipped very fast! Earrings are more of a gold color rather than rose gold but I still like them.
"Updated - Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani! Original Post July 30 ""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures. In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring. However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. Thank you so much!"
"These are so perfect! Shani was very flexible with me changing my mind and wanting two pairs at the same time and was kind enough to refund me the shipping for the second purchase so they could be sent together. Beautiful little pieces, and a pleasure to deal with Shani!"
"Really beautyful, l love them!"
"The earrings took a little while to arrive but that was expected, as they were shipped from the other side of the world. They are beautiful! I got them to go with a rose gold necklace of mine and I really like that they are unique, simple, and elegant. Thank you!!!"
These earrings are completely awesome! I ended up getting a few other pairs shown in the picture as well. Everything was presented beautifully and really high quality. Gracy was so sweet and did an incredible job making these items. I highly recommend this shop!
These earrings are easier to put on than the jacket type with a similar look. They look terrific on. I love them!
LOVE these earrings! And I was even gifted a cute letter ‚Äúe‚Äù ring complimentary with my order. Love the simple aesthetic and shipped surprisingly fast to the US!
"I can not express how much I love these earrings. I misplaced one around Christmas, and instead of doing an intense search I just went a ordered another pair. The seller is so nice and included something extra in the package and I really really appreciated that. I will be buying more from this shop in the future:)"
These earrings are perfect!! They look exactly like they do in the photos! They are delicate enough for everyday wear. I have gotten so many compliments in these! Since of my faves now!
"I love them! Very nice and great quality. And the customer service is really excellent if you need them, super reactive and flexible! Thanks a lot Catie."
I absolutely adore them! So delicate and unique. Will definitely purchase from this shop again!
"Love these! They are the perfect size to be noticeable, but not heavy at all. Arrived when expected, even with the postal delays in the States."
"I love these earrings, I have worn them everyday since receiving them. I really loved the wood display they come on too. Thank you"
"I'm wearing these a lot! And getting lots of compliments. Great quality, great design!"
Love these! So fun to wear!!!!!!
Davvero stupendo! L'ho regalato a mia moglie per San Valentino e le √® piaciuto tantissimo!
Gorgeously beautiful ear climbers. As much as I ordered few more for my daughter and myself. The note attached is heartwarming üíï Thank you!
Gorgeous glittery ear climbers! Simple to put on and looks great on the ears.
I have very sensitive ears so I‚Äôm always hesitant with new jewelry. I‚Äôve had these in all evening and I don‚Äôt have the faintest reaction! Highly recommend.
Custom made for a really good price. It's larger than I imagined which isn't a bad thing. I think Moissanite and Diamonds may be cut a little different which makes the Moissanite larger in diameter than a diamond. It's so pretty and it arrived way faster than I expected. I have no doubt my forever ring will last forever. Moissanite is very durable like a diamond. My first ring was a moissanite and looks exactly the same as it did when I bought it five years ago. Don't hesitate to buy from this shop!
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
I am so happy I went with this Etsy seller. I LOVE this ring. Had it checked to verify it is 10k and real moissanite. I can‚Äôt stop looking at it and will DEFINITELY be looking for Mother‚Äôs Day and Christmas! Thank you Harshita for answering my many questions also. I am very particular about stone size and having my rings be similar in thickness and width. Pictured is my new eternity bezel set 1.24 ctw in moissanite next to my 2 ct moissanite solitaire ‚ù§Ô∏è I love love love!!!!!
Exactly what I wanted. Thanks!
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!
My daughter adores the beautiful earing and I enjoy the superb customer service! It is the second time I did a purchase in Kivotos and I can only highly recommend it! Many thanks again!
"Exactly what I wanted. I decided to purchase one for my left ear, as well."
"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop ü•∞, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again üòÅ"
"The rose gold ear climbers are a beautiful color just as I hoped. They stay in place quite well. Sometimes my hair catches them but that's the life with a lot of crazy waves. They go up almost half way up my ear, were easy to put in and they are classy and funky with out being ""too much"" to wear to an office, interview, etc. They arrived quickly and were packaged nicely. I would purchase from Glamrock again."
Obsessed with these.
"It's beautiful, comfortable, stays in place, and exactly as pictured! It also is one of the few earrings I can wear that doesn't irritate my sensitive ears. I love it and have gotten so many compliments on it already. Thank you Kristen!"
These earrings are gorgeous! I get constant compliments on them. They require a little fiddling and squeezing to get them to stay in place.
"Best purchase I've made in a long time, quality is superb! I've worn them every day since I got them and gotten so many compliments because they are so beautiful and unique, thank you Otis Jaxon!"
"Beautiful gorgeous earrings! More stunning when seen in person than on the screen. Needless to say, very stylish when worn! Really happy with my purchase."
My favs. So gorgeous and different to everyone else. Quality is exceptional and packing is gift worthy
"The earrings arrived with scratches in the finish. Although minor, the scratches would catch the light, making them very apparent. After going back and forth with the seller, they finally agreed that I could return the item...at my own expense. Poor customer service!"
"As we explained in our messages, polished items are never going to have the perfect mirror finish due to the softness of sterling silver and the polishing materials used. Our customers usually have an understanding of this but I apologize if this was not what you have expected."
Love these! Wore them to a wedding and received so many compliments on how gorgeous they were.
"These earrings are so beautiful, also versatile. I put the hoop jacket on to dress up and where the circular studs all of the time."
"Really loved both items I purchased. Well-made and modern, simple design. I'm always on the hunt for simple daily jewelry that is different from the rest and I've found the right place!"
Received on time and very pretty! Love the polished silver!
"Beautiful as always! Shipping was reasonably fast. Each piece is so well made, I am a lifetime fan."
Super cute! They don't irritate my eats at all.
Loved these. Took a lil while to get to me but I was not in a rush. I think covid slowed transit down. But love these. No complaints
"Lil bit bigger than I expected, but I like it very much! Thank you!"
I was so excited to receive this & finally did. Packaging is cute enough & they write that they are excited and expecting to read a positive review online w/a very thick marker that isn't the easiest to read. I love the look of these earrings but they won't stay put/stay in place in one ear so will be returning.
"I love the ear climbers, very delicate and look very nice on. They also arrived quicker than I expected. I am very pleased with this purchase!"
These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! I love them! They fit nice and snug and I have had no problems with them slipping down. Shipping was super fast. Excellent work!
My package came today!!! I LOVE everything about my earrings AND the packaging is lovely!!! Thank you!!!
Great little earrings! I was nervous because I wanted to wear these in my third holes but they are small enough that they look great even that far up my earlobe without going into the part where my ear curls over. Comfy enough to sleep in (though I usually turn them face down) which is what I wanted and it was really hard to find a climber earring that didn't have a stud back. The back also is adjustable for how tight it is which is nice and no irritation from wearing them for a long time. Highly recommend!
These earrings are amazing! I didn't want anything too big just simple and dainty and these earrings are exactly that! So happy with my purchase and so happy with the quality. Thanks again!
Beautiful delicate climbers. Clearly well made. I'm so excited to have them. They didn't take long to arrive either. Love love love them. Thank you so much!!!!
Items are both as described. Love them both and am about to visit shop again!!! Thanks so much :)
Super je suis ravie. Merci
Super r√©activit√© du service client rien √† redire ! La bague est top et j‚Äôai fait aussi des boutons de manchette personnalis√©s qui sont vraiment uniques !
Un vrai bonheur cette commande ! Estelle a tout fait pour que je re√ßoive ce cadeau destin√© √† mon mari pour notre anniversaire de mariage √† la bonne date et m√™me deux jours avant malgr√© ma commande tardive. Tr√®s bonne communication et superbe article de qualit√© nous sommes ravis. Encore mille mercis et bien entendu je recommande sans souci. L'humain est primordial pour Estelle et cela devient rare
"Ich bin wirklich begeistert. Die Qualit√§t wirkt sehr hochwertig. Das Tragen der Klammer ist angenehm. Man merkt sie √ºberhaupt nicht. Ich hatte tats√§chlich diesbez√ºglich bedenken aber diese sind √ºberhaupt nicht eingetroffen. Danke! Auch daf√ºr, dass ihr das P√§ckchen mit so viel liebe verpackt habt"
"An sich sehr sch√∂ner Cliff und super schneller Versand! Hatte ihn den ersten Tag zuhause getestet, da sa√ü er gut und ist gef√ºhlt nicht verrutscht, daher den Tag darauf ""drau√üen"" abgehabt. Leider habe ich ihn dabei wohl sogleich verloren ohne es zu merken. Ich bin nirgends h√§ngen geblieben oder √§hnliches, das hei√üt er muss wohl recht locker gewesen sein oder wie kann ich mir das sonst erkl√§ren... Schade, ich hatte mich schon gefreut, ihn oft zu tragen, aber so traue ich mich nicht, nochmal zu bestellen, wenn die Freude dann nur so kurz ist, auch wenn ich es nat√ºrlich irgendwie selbst verschuldet haben muss."
Super Qualit√§t und schnelle Lieferung. Das Paket war sehr s√º√ü und mit viel Liebe verpackt!
"Ich habe das Paket leider erst 10 Tage nach Bezahlung erhalten bzw. ging es auch erst 9 Tage danach an mich raus. Der Cuff ist ganz h√ºbsch, allerdings etwas arg gro√ü."
Ricevuto oggi:bellissimo!!! L'indosso √® perfetto sul mio lobo e non si sente di averlo indosso. Molto chic!!! Lo consiglio‚ù§Ô∏è
"Exactly as described and so unique, I love it!"
These dagger earrings are so high quality and BEAUTIFUL!!!
My daughter so happy to get this we loved it x
"I love Lucie‚Äôs jewelry!! I now have two of her items that I‚Äôve been coveting (elk antler ear climbers and cedar ring) and both were shipped out sooner than expected and arrived perfectly. The quality of her jewelry is well above what I had expected, and every piece is so delicate and beautifully detailed. I will definitely be treating myself to more of her pieces in the future! Thank you Lucie!"
"I've wanted to try an ear climber for a while, but wasn't really sure how they would look on me. I decided on this gorgeous design and I'm so glad I did. I love them (I ordered the pair). They are fantastic...don't hesitate if you're thinking about these!"
Amazing! I love these. I was searching for the perfect pair of ear climbers and I found them!!! I wanted something interesting but not blingy. These are beautiful and classy with a bit of edgy. Great quality!
"Totally love this piece! It is beautiful, it holds in place, it is comfortable and I've gotten several compliments. It shipped really quickly."
Really beautyful!
"These earrings are BEAUTIFUL, so well made, really quality pieces, well worth the wait, thank you so much!!"
"Ik heb hem nog steeds niet ontvangen, had me zo verheugd om ze met Kerst te dragen ‚òπÔ∏è Finaly I received my ear-ornaments, one month to late but very wonderful and exacty as I wished."
De oorbellen zijn op tijd verzonden en met zorg ingepakt. Ook leuk gedaan een los cadeautasje. De oorbellen zijn erg mooi en conform de foto
"Conforme √† la description, je recommanderai sur cette boutique !!! Je les adore ! Je ne suis pas habitu√© √† en porter des aussi grandes et le fermoir est long ce qui est normal! Merciiiiii !"
bonjour tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles mais ne tiennent pas bien aux oreilles les embouts en sillicone glisse facilement et du coup en retirant mon masque j'en ai perdu une je suis assez d√©√ßue.
Bonjour Laurence Je vous ai laiss√© un message en priv√©.
petites boucles d'oreilles tr√®s sympas!!!
"Envoi rapide et soign√© en lettre suivie. Jolies boucles avec √©mail turquoise, tr√®s l√©g√®res, discr√®tes (petite goutte de 2cm de longueur et de 1cm de largeur). La couleur est bleu-vert (cela semble bleu en photo mais tire plus sur le vert en r√©alit√©, mais joli aussi). Je suis contente de mon achat et recommande cette boutique."
Les boucles d'oreilles sont vraiment jolies ! Colis re√ßu environ 1 mois apr√®s avoir command√©.
Beautiful little set. Sized more for a child than for an adult but the quality is amazing. Shipping was over a month from Israel to US.
I was worried when I received it and saw how to wear the ear climber... but now I wear it all the time and absolutely love it.
So pleased with this purchase.Delivered promptly.The earrings are lovely-very unusual and special.Thank you so much.
Shipment was on time I like the way they looks on my ear all my colleagues love it .they are unique design. Everybody were curious how it can be wear. They are lovely. If it had pin to lock it on the earlobe it would be fantastic
"Sono bellissimi, fanno un figurone...anche su di me che ho decisamente le orecchie piccoline! Ci hanno messo un po' pi√π del previsto ad arrivare, ma sotto natale, era prevedibile."
"Super pratique, se pose bien sur mes oreilles, j'aime √©norm√©ment... je n'ai aucune allergie avec le mod√®le argent... vraiment je suis conquise par tous mes achats..."
"Beautiful in its simplicity! Fits perfectly in the ear curves. Love it, love it, love it!"
What an amazing purchase! This climber earring is absolutely stunning. It is so much more beautiful in real life. It is such a bonus that a matching stud is also supplied for the other ear. Highly recommend!
"These earrings are truly beautiful! I ordered them for my wedding day, crystal and rose gold finish! Can‚Äôt say enough, truly perfect for my big day!"
These earrings are truly beautiful! Thank you so much! I'm soooo in love with them!!
Amazing customized earrings! Fantastic quality! Very comfortable for such a large crawler and stays in place!
"These ear crawlers are AWESOME! I'm so happy I got the pair. Murray is GREAT - so professional, responsive, and talented. So many beautiful creations in his shop to treat yourself and others to, and the QUALITY PLUS VALUE of his jewelry is UNBELIEVABLE. My favorite shop!"
"I am very satisfied with this large 14KT gold diamond climber earring. I chose to buy two to wear as a pair of earrings and they look very nice on the ears. I felt the color of the gold was very nice, not that tarnish dull look, had some slight heft of weight that you could initially feel in your hand when you first picked one or both up. The diamonds aren‚Äôt huge, dull, or yellowish cloudy and they are not chips, which I did not totally expect, but they definitely have to pass that ‚Äúquality‚Äù and ‚Äúsparkle‚Äù factor for me to keep my purchase, which I am very happy to say, and recommend this seller to anyone for being highly recommended first before spending and going to your brick and mortar stores when in reality these pieces are as well just as beautiful but by giving you a by far better value."
Absolutely beautiful!!
"Gave these feather gold earrings as a gift to the bride to wear on her wedding day. She loved them and looked stunning. They are beautiful, and exactly as described."
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
"These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)"
"I LOVE these earrings! Oak leaves and acorns are my family‚Äôs thing (because of the saying ‚ÄúMighty oaks from little acorns grow.‚Äù) so these earrings are very special to me. They are well made and beautiful! I‚Äôd buy the other earring set available too if the two earrings were mirror images of each other. Also, if there were a bar style necklace with a chain soldered to each side of this curved oak branch, I‚Äôd buy it too. I definitely recommend these earrings!"
"Charming little acorn + oak leaf earrings with lots of pretty detail! üçÇ Very sophisticated, too. Many thanks, Joanna!"
Beautiful dainty oak branches! Expertly and we'll made. Definitely my new favorites!!! A++++
I ordered these as a Thank You grift for my oldest sister/ Bridesmaid. She is incredibly picky but when I showed her these she LOVED them. They are delicate and beautiful in person. Each item is handmade and comes in an adorable package as well! Shipping was also super easy and fast!
Excellent seller! Great communication and great customer service! Ear cuff is very good quality and exactly as pictured
It‚Äôs very cute and dainty !
Me encantan! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ Los otros en la foto son de Ohana tambi√©n. I love them! The other ones in the photo are by Ohana too. I thought they were lost in transit because it went weeks without updating after leaving Spain but they arrived a day after the latest expected date. Beatriz was very nice; she told if they didn't arrive by the expected day she would've contacted the delivering company to see where it was. Definitely going to be buying more from them! The wait was worth it. I live in New York. It took a little bit over a month to get here.
Obsessed!!!
"Segunda compra con Ohana. Estos pendientes me chiflan. Son una belleza. Han atra√≠do muchas miradas en mi entorno üòÖ Para mi son unos pendientes 2 en 1 porque puedes ponerte solo la estrella superior como si fuera un brillantito o ""stud"". Envio rapid√≠simo y cuidada presentaci√≥n. Gracias a la tienda por atender mi solicitud de minimizar el uso de pl√°stico desechable en mi paquete."
These are stunning! They came in a great little box and see gorgeous in person. I highly suggest for anyone looking to give great quality earrings at a great price! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Very nice seller, unfortunately, my first parcel was lost on the way, but she helped me a lot. I appreciate it! A pair of French bulldog earrings are soooo nice and adorable!!!"
I WEAR a different combination every day <3 :D
"Wow are these gorgeous! I‚Äôm a minimalist and picky about what goes into my closet. I‚Äôve searched for a few years and finally found the perfect piece. They‚Äôre light, well-crafted, extremely stylish. Very happy customer!"
I bought these earrings during current lockdown for my Son‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs 40th birthday. Beautifully designed and made. Arrived on time. Will definitely buy from this supplier again.
It is even more beautiful in person. The pendant with writing wasn‚Äôt attached due to the jump ring not being fully closed so I placed it back on the chain and closed the jump ring (I have jewelry tools). I am in love with this piece!!
Great customer service (friendly and helpful) and prompt dispatch. The earrings are lovely and I‚Äôm delighted with them. Will definitely order again from this shop!
These earrings are just gorgeous - beautifully made and so pretty - fast shipping too - thank you again!
I asked for flat gold discs instead of the little ball studs and was accomodated! These are high quality- you can feel it in the weight of the product. They look super cool and are what I envisioned and wanted in an ear jacket set. I really appreciate the ability to set how low or high you want the jacket to be. It's bound to be as snug or as low as you want it! Thank you so so much!!
These are awesome! I love them! Very very light and comfortable. I can wear my headphones at work without the post hurting me. Lots of compliments on them too! These look WAY better than my picture shows.
Exactly what I was looking for! Love them thank you so much!
"I love these! I've always had issues with small earrings looking like they've disappeared in my ear lobe because of the shape, but these don't! They're super simple for everyday wear, but you can also use them for something a little fancier!"
"I love this earrings very much, it shipped on time; the seller is great and I definitely purchase more items from her."
"Beautiful set of earrings, you can wear it as a single stud or a jacket! I love the adjustable aspect of the jacket as well! Love it!"
Super cute!!!
Love the delicacy of this climber. My daughter wanted ear cuff climbers for Christmas; her look of delight when she realized these were waves told me we made the perfect selection.
"I love these earings. They are really well made, everything was on time and i will definetly buy more beautiful items from this shop. Sharing love and pretty things. Thank you!"
"These earring are absolutely PERFECT , I‚Äôve had other climbers that constantly fall off the ear but these stay right where you put them- so beautiful and exactly what I was expecting! Highly recommend this shop- I will be buying more from here! (Also received a promo code simply for shopping for my next purchase)"
I get so many compliments! I love These!
I ordered these as a gift and sort of waited to the last minute ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (totally my bad). I was concerned that they wouldn‚Äôt come quick enough due to COVID and possible delays. I reached out to Amy and she was super responsive and told me to place the order that night and she‚Äôd pop them in the mail the next day. My did she deliver! They got here quicker than I had hoped and are just beautiful! My friend loves them and wears them everyday as a second-hole staple. They‚Äôre so cute and extremely comfortable- you can sleep with them in. Really beautiful craftsmanship and amazing customer service. I‚Äôll definitely shop from Amy again. Thank you SO much!
Beautiful little climbers that add a lot of flair for every day looks or special occasions. Shipped and arrived incredibly fast. Thank you!
"Third purchase of these great little ear pins over the years. They are my go-to ""stud"" so they do get lost occasionally :) There are many versions of this style available on Etsy, but I find this design and execution the most-elegant. Squirrels Nest always has great customer service, can do custom design work, and ships quickly."
"Loved my first pair so much - I had to buy more! Seller was a pleasure to communicate with, not to mention unbelievably accommodating! Will definitely be buying more in the future :-)"
LOVE! I didn't realize how small it really is; I was ecstatic about how cute & little it was. Perfect fit & lovely details. Thanks!!
"I knew I would love these when I saw them on Etsy. However, I reeeeeeally LOVE them in person. They are a beautiful delicate quality of sterling silver. The price is worth it. Prompt delivery and wrapped with class and care. Very Happy.......Thank you!!"
This is so cute for the cartilage. It's dainty yet big enough to be noticed. When I first put it on it stuck out due to my ear curving and the earring being straight. The metal is thin enough that I was able to bend it slightly and now it fits perfect!
I'm so happy I decided to get this feather earring. It looks so nice in my cartilage ‚ù§ Beautifully made!
These earrings are beautiful. I wore them for my wedding and a number of people commented on how pretty and unusual they were. I was a bit worried that they wouldn't come in time but they came quickly and boxed carefully and presented well. Very pleased!
Absolutely beautiful earrings! The quality is great and the service was excellent. I definitely can't wait to add more to my collection!
"I can't wait to wear these at my 8-person wedding, and they are not so fancy that I couldn't get away with wearing them at other occasions :) Feel great on, not too snug or heavy."
Beautiful earrings very impressed with quality and service thank you
"Thank You for changing my order for me , I really appreciate it. The ear crawlers are really pretty!"
I ordered two sets of earrings and love them both! This open hoop is a little big for my ear but I just tilt it up and it works perfectly. I tried it in my first hole and ended up liking it better in my second.
These are beyond gorgeous and the perfect size! Now I don't have to take all of my earrings out every night before bed because my head isn't being stabbed by the standard posts. I'm in love and never going back!
"So comfortable and adorable for everyday wear! I was confused with how to order a pair, the seller was helpful and honest when I ordered two single hoops and refunded me for the overpayment. If you want a pair, select 2 hoops; it doesn't mean it has two hoops, it means, you get a matching pair of single hoops!"
"I love these earrings! Very dainty and modern. I love pairing the dot and the triangle together. I do find they can rotate a bit after sleeping on them, but I've worn them for a couple of weeks now and I've had no issues with them falling out at all! They stay put well and they're very comfortable to wear. I also have very sensitive ears and I've had no irritation with these! Would absolutely recommend these and get them again."
Love them!!!!
I love the earrings! They are beautiful! Now I‚Äòm hooked and need to buy more :)
"I have ruined my ears with gauges in the past, the holes are small but still too big for regular earrings these work so perfectly, they are so beautiful in person and well made!! So perfect for my wedding day. Came very quickly, my only criticism is the packaging. Could be more nicely packaged it up. But the earrings themselves were not damaged or anything at all."
Lovely earrings. Packed up in cute little boxes too. Seller had been in touch to advise about very long shipping time between US and UK which was very helpful. Package delivered safely and much quicker than anticipated.
"They are beautiful, first time wearing climber earrings but they stayed on and didn‚Äôt move all day, very dainty, sparkly and eye catching, love love love them üß°"
These ear climbers are stunning! Quick delivery also. Thank you so much!
"These are so beautiful, very comfortable wear, & unique. I love them!!"
"Beautiful, and it stays on. Great shipping time."
"absolutely gorgeous climbers! so unique, I never want to take them off!"
Thank you so much..These arrived today.They are so beautiful..Lots of love & care in these earrings..A gift to my daughter for her wedding day..I would highly recommend this store..Aya Jewellery.
This is what I sent to the beautiful creator of my bridal jewelry- Thank you so much you have truly made my day ideal and so easy with this. Your pieces are beautiful and beyond honestly. I really wanted to get your head piece too truth be told! But what you have created is magic. Just know you‚Äôre changing people‚Äôs dream since they were little because you did mine ‚ú® I am so thankful to come across her page IF YOU ARE EVEN THINKING OF BUYING. Omg let me tell you it is so stunning when you get your pieces. It matches my dress perfect but also me as well. My day hasn‚Äôt come yet but when it does and I have my photos I will most definitely share.
"Loved these! They are just as beautiful and sparkly in person. Wore them for my wedding day and plan to wear them for many more weddings/events I attend. The only issue was the size of the holes in the ear jacket itself. The earring posts only fit in some (not all) of the holes, so I couldn't wear them on the lower setting I wanted to (since only one side fit through). I wore them on a higher setting so the ear jacket sat lower. They still looked great, just not quite the look I was going for."
Very pretty ring. Just like the picture. I get a lot of compliments!
"Joli collier, tr√®s fin, et qui se marie bien avec diff√©rents v√™tements. je suis ravie de cet achat !"
Collier magnifique ! Commande arriv√© rapidement et bien emball√© Merci
"Bought this as a gift for a friend, came in good time and he loved it! Thank you!"
Bought as gifts for my daughter and nieces. Beautifully made and packaged. They love them!
Love them so much! So dainty. I‚Äôve received so many compliments. Super fast shipping too!
"Wish I could give the customer service more than five stars!.. she was so helpful and so kind!üòä Although I had a slight problem with the earrings at first, she was kind so and willing to do all that she could to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I wear these earrings EVERY day! They‚Äôre so so cute. ü•∞"
"I purchased these for my sister in rose gold, and she loved them! They are well made and just as described. My sister has her ears double pierced, so wears them in her second hole, with statement earring in her first piercing. They look awesome and now I want a pair! :) I would definitely recommend these!"
I love these! They are well made and really unique. They have become my go-to when my hair is up.
"Very pretty, good quality, fast shipping. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchases! Will definitely order again"
"I love these earrings. The level of detail is fabulous and they are lightweight, which I really appreciate after wearing them all day."
I LOVE my choker! It was shipped super quick and is great quality. I am definitely ordering another one!
"Tr√®s bonne qualit√© de fil, et la couleur est extraordinaire ! Je cherchais depuis longtemps des teintes aussi vives et lumineuses, notamment dans la gamme des jaunes et les coloris propos√©s dans cette boutique sont vraiment tr√®s beaux. Exp√©dition rapide, colis impeccable, bref, une commande parfaite !"
Les couleurs sont top !!! Merci pour le petite plus. Je recommande !!

Absolutely stunning earrings. Exactly as described/pictured and very high quality. Shipped immediately and received only two days after purchase! The seller is so helpful and easy to communicate with. I have bought four items so far and will definitely purchase again from this shop.
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©"
"I ADORE the white topaz ear pins! I bought a pair instead of just the one. I wore them out to dinner last night and I was stopped by several people and asked about them. I have my ears pierced 15 times, so ear cuffs and crawlers dont really work for me. I will definitely be ordering some more similar items from this shop. Beautiful!"
Beautiful ear cuff looks amazing in the ear and very fast delivery too. I think I may have to order another one very soon :) A+++++++ for quality and service.
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"When I ordered the ring, the listing said it would take a few weeks to arrive, but we received it in 8 days! I had to wait almost 2 weeks before Etsy would leave a review, that's how fast it shipped. The ring itself is perfect, it's very light compared to a lot of modern men's rings and the comfort fit edge is very smooth. It's a little small but that's my fault for not accommodating my fiance's knuckles. We're going to take it to a local jeweler to be sized because that issue is not Pompeii's fault. Definitely recommend using these guys if you're looking for a men's ring."
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
Bought two pairs of those in size M and XL. Very good quality! Very happy with it and now buying in size L too :) On the photo is XL one.
"the ruby and pink gold ear cuff is really stunning! A little hard getting it in but, once it's in it stays there until you take it off ( which is easy ). Thank you for making such beautiful ear cuff. I have a third one on it's way to me now! Highly recommend!"
Perfect! I love them and the seller was amazing. I will be back! Worth the price and the wait! I will upload pics at a later time but I assure you they are beautiful.
LOVE these! Wanted a pair of simple but unique silver earrings and these fit the bill. These may be my new favorite earrings (and I have a lot of them!)
"The earrings are just as I expected, I love them! They arrived so quickly from NB to Ontario. I would definitely order from Savijewelry again."
LOVE THE EARRINGS!!
Les bijoux sont tous jolis et de bonne qualit√©. Je suis enti√®rement satisfaite !
"I love these earrings! I will say that shipping was exceptionally slow, with no tracking info shared, and the seller could have been more responsive. That said, the product was worth it!! **EDIT, these have become my favorite jewelry I‚Äôve ever owned and have held up extremely well with being slept in and worn constantly. So worth it!!!"
"I am in love with these earrings. They also have an adjustable post (on the dangling piece) to accommodate short or long earlobes - so thoughtful! I also received a small gift in addition to the order. These are handmade pieces, so expect some time for your delivery, but it was worth the wait! <3"
üíñ love it
I love all moon jewelry this earrings is next in my collection üòç
Earrings as expected! The posts on the jacket part actually allow me to make it a teeny bit higher or lower on my ear as well as a little left or right which I really like. They fit my lobe as expected and they're nice and shiny :) Hoping the shine lasts!
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! The backing has sizing to fit various sized earlobes. These are my new go-to earrings.
The earrings are beautiful and I can tell the seller puts a lot of effort in their work! Shipping took longer than expected but that was because of covid.
Obsessed with these! They hug my ear perfectly and are so unique. I get compliments on them all the time!
"These earrings are quite literally, out of this world (hence, usually I have poor timing :))) you can waer time any time of year, for literally and occasional. The first day I wore them, I received more then 20 compliments!!! Soooo, thank you kindly !!!!"
Rings looked exactly like photos. First time I bought something that didn't disappoint on Etsy. Facets may seem a bit rough but I'm ok with it. The inside is very well made and comfortable. Only tricky bit is getting the size right. My size felt a bit loose so when I shower I have to be careful. This ring's design may be more well suited for women than for men. But this really depends on the man's style. Overall I'm pleased with the product and will not hesitate to recommend. Thanks!
"This ring is absolutely stunning! It's slim and dainty, but also so beautifully engraved that it is simply and perfectly elegant. My sister and I met for the first time in November of 2019 - I was adopted - and have grown close, so we wanted to get something to remember each other by since we live so far apart. These rings are precious mementos and are far more beautiful than the images can portray. On another note, this seller is a SAINT! He is beyond kind and patient. We royally screwed up the order by choosing the wrong size and the wrong gold color, but he worked with us until it was sorted. I cannot overstate this; Ran is absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much!"
My fiancee and I are so in love with our gorgeous wedding rings. They are actually much more beautiful in person and the details so intricate! The seller was incredibly attentive and kind; definitely a talented craftsman who takes pride in his work. Thank you so much for the prompt delivery and making our dream rings possible! We would absolutely make future purchases from this seller.
I can‚Äôt say enough amazing things about these earrings. They‚Äôre perfectly simple yet incredibly elegant. I ordered them to wear on my wedding day and I got so many compliments on them. They look stunning in pictures as they have such a high-end and contemporary design. The only downside to my earrings were that they were actually stolen on my wedding night - so clearly I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks they‚Äôre gorgeous! I definitely recommend these earrings and the seller! I look forward to replacing my earrings once the wedding and our move is paid off - they‚Äôre definitely earring I think you can dress up or down. They‚Äôre the perfect pair of versatile earrings.
I am in love with these earrings! Beautiful made and look great. They are so me! Fast shipping from Israel and packed lovely. Thank you!
Je les adore ces boucles d'oreilles que tout le monde remarque !!! Superbes.
I really love these earrings. Couldn't imagine that somethi g could be that beautiful but these ones do. They are so unique. I can really recommend to buy them.
"These earrings are so beautiful and delicate and the diamond quality is incredible. I continue to add pieces from this designer to my collection for ALL of my piercings, including my cartilage helix piercing. I love that they also can make them for piercings - that is so rare and hard to find with real diamonds and high quality gold without overpaying for the name brand. These are just as if not more gorgeous as any of the high-end piercing brands out there, at between a quarter or half of the price. You will not be disappointed!!!"
The earrings are beautiful and great communication between seller and myself. A+
Love it. Great quality and fast shipping.
"Item was not as described and sent back immediately. I was told I would be reimbursed for return shipping cost, which did not happen. At first, I was only given a partial refund, then offered a amazon gift card for the rest?! Said no. Something is off here, finally got full refund, but still waiting for my return shipping costs due to item not being as described."
Love these they're so adorable and I have gotten so many compliments particularly when I went to go see Infinity War at the cinema! Thank you!
"These earrings were cute, and a big success at my daughter's superhero party. Thank you."
Love my new earrings! They came super quick and were packaged with care! Definitely going to order more
Looks so cute and was packed in a cute box perfect for gifts
The earrings took two weeks to arrive. It was totally okay it's understandable because I ordered it on the 22nd of December. The earrings are simple and beautiful. I definitely needed a youtube video to help me put them on. After viewing the video it takes you seconds to put them on. Totally worth the money! Must by
"Love it! got great compliments already from the first day I put it on! FYI, must read and understand the size of the item. I was anticipating a little bigger. Picture can be deceiving, but I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase."
"I previously posted that I couldn't get the earrings to stay in place, but I was pretty sure it was me and not the earrings. I was right! I tried them again today, and they're staying in place just fine. I love them! Arrived fast, and they're lovely, but I just can't get them to rest in my ear the way they do in the photos. I wear them pointing down instead, and am happy with them, but wish I could get them to stay put long-wise. I'm pretty sure it's due to the shape of my ears / user error, though, and not the earrings themselves. :)"
"I absolutely love these earrings. I have received so many compliments about how they are ""so you."" I never like wearing earrings because they usually are heavy on my ears or poke my head behind my ears. Most earrings irritate my skin, but these don't. These ones are light weight and lay in my ear naturally. i cant even feel them. I could sleep in them! Thank you, i will definitely be back!"
"Climbers are so beautiful! They arrived in a cute little corked jar where they live when I'm not wearing them. The stem piece that will thread through the hole is a little thicker than most earrings, but they went in fine. Love em!"
"These are beautiful and everything I was hoping for. I wore them to my college graduation and had many compliments and people asking where I got them. They are a bit difficult to get in at first and are EXTREMELY fragile, so they are definitely not for everyday wear. If you are looking for an earring you can just put in and forget about then these are not for you. But, if you're looking for a beautiful and unique piece of jewelry to make you stand out and look Awesome, then these are it. I especially loved the package they were delivered in. Just magical!"
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)"
"Shipping takes a while but that is totally normal since the product is shipping from Philippines! They were well worth the wait, I put them on immediately! So cute + dainty. Love them <3"
Earrings came SUPER FAST & are SUPER CUTE. I get compliments at least once/day. Will definitely be buying more soon!
"Gorgeous! This is my first set of ear climbers, and I love mixing and matching them with other earrings for asymmetrical looks. <3"
"These are so cute! They are as pictured and arrived quickly. They are pretty sturdy as well - when I was undressing one fell off in the bathroom and I couldn't find it and, of course, the next morning I stepped on it with my shoe and bent it. :( I was able to carefully straighten it out without breaking it. I don't recommend doing it, and it could have easily snapped on a delicate area but I'm so glad it didn't."
I bought these and the leaf ones - love them both. They¬¥re super pretty and no problem to slip on. They stay in place nicely.
"I don't know why I waited so long to purchase these. Seriously, they are the cutest little dainty ear jackets! Love the little spirals and curls, they are charming. Plus the phenomenal packaging - they come in a great little box, with anti tarnish strip, and the earrings are clipped onto a tree slice, words don't do it justice but it's fancy and perfect if you're wanting to gift these to someone very lucky! Photo doesn't do the box justice. I am pleased (very pleased!) with this purchase and highly recommend the seller."
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I am in love with them! I just received them yesterday and I have already gotten a couple compliments on them too! Amazing! :-)
"Really Beautiful! Just as pictured and the packaging was a beautiful bonus. My ONLY disappointment is not quality or service related and can't remedied without custom work, but I want to mention it so you are aware. When wearing these earrings as pictured here, the back piece hangs down more than I'd like it to on MY ears. This is due to the position of the hole in my ear and consequently a narrow lobe. However, this may not be the case for your ears. I was just hoping the back piece would 'cup' my ear, not hang down so low. I still love them and wear them the other way! They were worth the wait and actually arrived sooner than I expected, considering where they came from (I'm in the US). So, still an all around 5 Stars."
"This earrings couldn't be anymore awesome. They came nicely placed in a little wooden slice, with a piece of polishing cloth and an anti-tarnish paper. The work is delicate, excelent, and the overall look is super dainty and elegant. I love them, and I'm sure I will be back in the future, totally recommended shop!"
Obsessed!
Very cute! Just needs to be noted that it‚Äôs 3 pieces; I assumed they were 2. But it still looks amazing and I‚Äôm happy with it!
Beautiful craftsmanship and quality. I've had tons of compliments. I am picky about jewelry and want pieces that are unique but understated and these earrings are both.
"I love them so much, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."
"Once again,I am over the moon with these gorgeous ear climbers. They are so different and so comfortable to wear.I love the colours,which is a nice added bonus. And guess what??!! I've just bought another pair lol..I just can't keep awayüòâ Thank you so much üíñ xxxx"
"love these earrings. They are climbers, but they aren't obnoxiously climbers, so if you're looking for something that is similiar, but not all the way up your earlobe, these are the ones. The titanium is great for my daughter who has a nickel allergy. We have the silver matte finish, and I am thinking about orderring a pair for myself, or maybe stealing my daughter's pair. ships from Greece, so it does take a minute getting here, but they are beautifully wrapped. Went in easter basket."
Lovely earrings!!!!!
Not an earring you see everyday! Love them!! Can't believe how fast they arrived in the mail. Thanks
Beautiful and versatile. Perfect for a quick change of look from day to evening! They arrived promptly and beautifully packaged.
Exceptional! Pretty amazing design and quality. And perfectly fine communication with designer/seller :)
"Great people to work with. My earrings were not quite what I wanted and item was refunded quickly and courteously. Buy with confidence, great service"
Tr√®s belle paire de manchette oreille ! J'aime ces petites feuilles. Bien emball√©. Bravo pour votre joli travail !
The earrings are beautiful! They are very easy to put on and wear. I am wearing them in my 2nd holes and they are very comfortable! Thank you! Will be back!
"Shipping from Us to Belgium was very fast. It is a very elegant,classy earring and very well made with a lot of details. I love it and i will be back for more :-). Also thank you very much for the handwritten note."
Gorgeous. Love her ear climbers.
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles je les aime beaucoup
"Comme d'habitude, belle qualit√©, envoi rapide, bijoux raffin√©s"
"Tr√®s jolies boucles, originales par ses couleurs. Envoi dans les d√©lais annonc√©s. Je suis ravie de cet achat qui a fait l'objet d'un cadeau."
"Boucles d'oreilles de bonne qualit√©,√©l√©gantes,dans un joli pochon."
"Very pretty! They're a little large for my tiny ears, but I actually love the bolder look. The hooked backing ensures that they don't budge once they're on. Great earrings!"
"I love, love, love these ear climbers. I think I need another pair in rose gold. Looking forward to getting the pyramid pendant in the near future too! Thank you Kristen - I love your work!"
Looks great and fits perfectly with the curve of my ear
These are so beautiful and cool. They are perfectly designed and look amazing. I am pretty thrilled with this purchase. Thank you!
These are so unique! Seller had great communication
"Beautiful earrings! They are elegant, but very interesting and modern!"
Absolutely gorgeous in person! This is my second purchase and everything I have received has been beautifully made. I will definitely be back for more. Very happy!
I love them! They are absolutely beautiful and easy to put on. I‚Äôll definitely be back for more!
Love Love Love my new earrings. Little bugger than what I imagined they‚Äôd be but that makes them even better!!!!
"Love it! it kinda hurts my ears the way it‚Äôs shaped, so I only wear them b on the days I‚Äôm trying to be cool. The little irritating is well worth it."
Exactly what I was looking for. They follow the ear curve beautifully. Great shop! Thank you.
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
These ear crawlers are so beautiful and really comfortable! I like them so much I ordered more pairs in different colors! Communication was great and shipping was fast. They also were packaged nicely. I can't say enough good things!
Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!
"Finally! I got the ring and it‚Äôs so pretty! The color is not as vibrant as in the picture‚Ä¶ a more pale pink. I got it in silver because I was afraid the gold plated would fade with time. The seller was very quick to reply to my inquiries. The shipping was slow (international shipping, from Greece to the USA). Even thou the seller provided the shipping tracking number, I wasn‚Äôt able to track it. I relied on the Etsy app telling me I could leave a review on Wednesday (today) and I received the ring on Monday. It took around 3 weeks from the day I ordered to the day it was delivered. So keep in mind the shipping times if you need the ring within a certain date."
"Exactly what I wanted. I decided to purchase one for my left ear, as well."
"Tous les bijoux que j'ai command√©s sur Kivotos Jewelry sont magnifiques et de tr√®s belle qualit√©, √† des prix abordables. L'√©quipe est efficace et de confiance. Une fois, Il y a eu un petit souci avec une de mes commandes et la boutique m'a renvoy√© le jour m√™me par colis express un autre colis. Moins de 48 h tout √©tait r√©gl√© ! :) Vous pouvez commander en toute confiance dans cette boutique !! :)) Merci All the jewels I ordered on Kivotos Jewelry are beautiful and of very good quality, at affordable prices. The team is efficient and trusted. Once, there was a small problem with one of my orders and the shop sent me another parcel by express the same day. Less than 48 hours everything was set! ::) You can order with confidence in this shop!! :)) Thank you"
I purchased 9 items from ShlomitOfir and every piece is exquisite and beautifully made. There are so many more items from the collection that I desire. The jewelry is elegantly boxed and arrived in very good time.
"Ordered these for myself for my boys to give me for Christmas. I definitely peeked when they arrived, and they look exactly like the picture. Can't wait to enjoy them!"
Love the design! The earrings are as pictured - good quality. Also super cute packaging!
So many compliments! Will be back for more soon!
"Absolutely perfect earrings! Not heavy at all, bright and unique. Great seller and great communication. Thanks Miriam!"
"It‚Äôs hard to put it in your ears, but once they are in, they are beautiful and just like on the pictures! Though it kinda irritates my ears"
Really lovely ear climbers! They fit perfectly and are comfortable to wear. The shipping was fast and the customer service is excellent!
I love these even though my ears are a little too small for them to go in my second hole like I had originally planned. Overall super cute.
These ear cuffs are beautiful and elegant! Very well made! They look very nice on the ear. Very comfortable to wear. Shipping was very quick. Would definitely buy from this seller again! They came in a very nice little bag made of soft material. Very pleased with purchase! Thank you for making these ear cuffs!
Beautiful! Worth every penny I love them!
So pretty and intricate. Arrived very quickly and wore them the next day.
Love the earrings! Wore them on my birthday today!
"These Earrings are beautiful! very bright and shiny material and the design is so unique. Delivery time (standard shipping) was about 3-4 weeks, but the packaging was adorable and I am very happy with the product!"
Love them! Even got send a free little ring ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Love them! Lost one from my first pair, so I had to order another!"
So totally cool. I'm so hip :)
I love them! They are adorable and comfortable. Thanks
I bought these for my daughter and she loves them! I'm very pleased with my purchase! Thank you!
"The item arrived quickly, I was a little surprised by how small it appeared. I thought it would be a little larger. I like it, though."
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
"Traumhaftes Schmuckst√ºck, ich werde t√§glich darauf angesprochen!! Ganz ganz ‚ù§Ô∏èlichen Dank daf√ºr! Ich bin restlos begeistert."
"Sehr sch√∂nes, elegantes Schmuckst√ºck, welches meine Erwartungen voll erf√ºllt hat."
"Ich hab¬¥ das ziemlich verbiegen m√ºssen, damit es passt."
I am glad I got the smaller size because they are a bit on the heavy side. The floral pattern makes these hood special.
The earring jackets are more beautiful than in the photo. They complement my small diamond stud earrings beautifully. They arrived on time and care was taken in the shipping. I am extremely pleased!
Lovely design and quality. Quick service. Love the custom options available at such a reasonable price. Thank you!
Beautiful pair of ear jackets!!
Tr√®s jolies BO. J'aime leur √©l√©gance et la finesse du travail du fil d'argent. La livraison a √©t√© ultra rapide dans un emballage tr√®s s√©curis√© + un bel √©crin pour les prot√©ger. Merci √† sheilandi pour son professionnalisme.

So so beautiful! Unique and stunning. I love them.
"Very nice ""construktion"" idea and it looks great! Also its very well made - thin and noble. Thank you very much to greece!"
"The earrings were a gift for my mother‚Äôs birthday, she loved them so much! The earrings are so beautiful and so well made. Love the zero waste packaging as well :)"
beautiful earrings! definitely a work of art!
These earrings are GORGEOUS and so sparkly. I ordered the rose gold color and got so many compliments on my wedding day. Everyone loved them and I am so happy they are trendy enough to rewear.
These earrings are gorgeous! They look even better in person than they do in the photos. I love that the back piece has several holes so you can adjust the earring to better fit your ear length. Very pleased with this purchase!
Absolutely gorgeous!
So glad I bought these elegant earrings - beautifully made -I certainly will visit again - Izabela's items are unique and classy!!! Thank you so much!!
Magnifique paire de boucles d'oreilles !
Gorgeous! Am thrilled this purchase. Excellent craftsmanship!
Ces boucles sont absolument magnifiques et d'une tr√®s grande originalit√©. Le travail est tr√®s soign√©. Je suis totalement satisfaite de mon achat. L'envoi est toujours aussi rapide et soign√©. Je recommande cette boutique. J'ai pass√© plusieurs commandes et je suis toujours impressionn√©e par la qualit√© et la finition des bijoux. Les prix son plus qu'abordables. Commandez sans aucune h√©sitation. What a sweet and beautiful pair of earrings. It is exquisitely detailed and beautifully made. So classy ! Thanks for making such a lovely affordable piece. Just love it !
"Th√®se earrings are stunning in person. The 100 year old filigree is in unbelievable condition. Like all my in store and Etsy purchases from here, the quality of the product is very high and despite my sensitive ears, I have never had an adverse reaction from their products. Despite my limited French, the owner always speaks English for my benefit."
"These are really simple and beautiful earrings! I have pierced ears and did not experience any problem with them slipping off. I have really little ears too! I thought they might be too long and mess with the ear cuffs I wear everyday, but they actually sit beneath them and help comfortably hold the cuffs up higher in a more attractive position so it worked out perfectly! I have been all about ear climbers lately and these are a great addition to my growing collection!"
"These are a totally different style for me, but I got engaged to a ‚Äòsky full of stars‚Äô and these just made me have ‚Äòfeels‚Äô. I absolutely love them, they are easy to put in when you know how, and they look lovely. They are exactly as pictured. They are very elegant and arrived in a beautiful little package! I loved opening to see what was inside. Thank you very much, recommended and would order again x"

"J'avais craqu√© en les voyant sur Internet, mais en les re√ßcevant, j'√©tais encore plus contente de mon achat. Les boucles sont magnifiques."
"I bought a pair, and am so glad that I indulged and got the real deal, they are stunning! A beautiful shape, sparkly and clearly real gold and stones, I feel like a million bucks wearing these. They're weightless on my ears so I can leave them on day and night, and they look gorgeous with the trio stud I also bought. Plus delivery was incredibly fast, two days from order to the UK! I'll be back...."
"Wonderful experience! I ordered on the 22 and received the earrings on the 24th! Super fast shipping! Beautiful earrings. I bought a pair. I‚Äôve had these in my cart for a while and finally purchased them. So glad I did. Super sparkly, unique and great quality. Thanks so much! :)"

Perfect ear climber for my third hole. Very happy with everything that I purchased. And shipping was very fast!
Tr√®s jolie boucles de qualit√© ! Ravie de mon achat
Ich bin begeistert wie schnell der Versand ging und wie wundervoll die Ohrringe sind. Sind in echt noch sch√∂ner als auf den Bildern. Absolute Kaufempfehlung ‚ù§
I love this earrings. I have received so many compliments on them. Perfectly cute and small enough for my ear
"Wasn't exactly flush to my ear like I was hoping from the picture, but I was able to move it a bit and adjust it so it was. It's beautiful otherwise! Fast shipping."
Wore these earrings on my wedding day and they were perfect. So beautiful. This is my 2nd pair. I unfortunately lost the 1st pair and I wanted to wear them for a wedding I was a bridesmaid in. I got a lot of compliments on the earrings!
"I love how dainty and unique they are. I got the gold and I'm glad I did. You don't really notice the gold, but I feel it makes the stones pop."
"These are so pretty, I've gotten lots of compliments. If I could do it over, I'd probably go with the post backs instead of the wire, but that's just personal preference. You do beautiful work!!!"
I got the earrings and I'm very pleased with them: quality and size. Definitely by the pictures. I am increasing this shopping experience as one of my most successful at etsy. I will definitely buy more from the seller.
These are just perfect. I love how simple and dainty these are and they sparkle beautifully. I‚Äôm really happy I bought them. Thank you!
"Love this earring! This is my second one I purchased. Feels great, looks beautiful! Get lots of compliments on it!"
"Beautiful! Initially, only ordered one. The quality was so impressive I decided I needed a pair! I have ordered other earrings from Full Moon and they are all beautifully made. Will definitely order again!"
"Beautiful earrings, absolutely delighted - thank you! Have worn them every day"
"I am BEYOND thrilled with this earring! it looks SO good! I actually have the silver one too, this is my second one! It makes me feel so fancy and expensive haha! really good quality and SO pretty! thank you!"
"Love, love, love, love, LOVE! Did I mention I love these earrings? Fast shipping, and received them yesterday. Wearing at work today! Can‚Äôt say enough, thank you!"
"Angie is absolutely amazing! She will work with you on designing anything! These are a classic with an exciting twist, not too over the top, but also just noticeable enough. I will always go to her for jewelry!!"
Classy and stunning. The halos add elegance and charm. I have paired these beauties with both the rose and turquoise bracelets in this order.
I'm SO in love with these earrings for my wedding! Thank you thank you thank you ‚ô°
"This ""Truly Meet"" Icon is beautiful! This is my favourite Orthodox Icon. The colours are vibrant. Received the item fairly quickly. Appreciate the bonus Icon of Mother of God and Christ with the lovely Prayer on the back. I put this in a pretty frame and it is beautiful! Thank You! Merci beaucoup!"

Poor quality Earring for a newborn not an adult Gave the earrings to next door neighbor 2 year old daughter
Beautiful ü§© Wear them every day!!!
"Such a beautiful pair of earrings.. so creative and unique, can tell that she puts her heart and soul into designing her beautiful collection."
"Tr√®s bonne qualit√© de fil, et la couleur est extraordinaire ! Je cherchais depuis longtemps des teintes aussi vives et lumineuses, notamment dans la gamme des jaunes et les coloris propos√©s dans cette boutique sont vraiment tr√®s beaux. Exp√©dition rapide, colis impeccable, bref, une commande parfaite !"
Les couleurs sont top !!! Merci pour le petite plus. Je recommande !!

"This is the second ring I asked to be made for me, I contacted Valentini to see if there was a purple colour available & if she could make this ring slightly differently to add a variation to the one that I already have. She responded to my questions promptly & kept me updated with the making of the ring, also sent me a photo of some of the purple colours that she had available for me to choose from. I honestly cannot recommend this seller & shop enough, such quality items with a very fast dispatch & very well packaged in a pretty yet sturdy way as to not get damaged in transit. If you have any questions just go ahead & ask you will definitely not be disappointed with this seller or any of the products she makes. A+++"
"Well, where can I start to explain just how amazing not only this seller is but the craftsmanship that has gone into making this ring. The seller answered all of my questions promptly, also made the ring to my requirements, it's absolutely stunning, simply beautiful & effective, well made also dispatched quickly & it arrived in next to no time. I would definitely recommend this seller & her craftsmanship, so don't delay just buy, you won't regret it."
These earrings are very pretty!!! They are very well made and they have a unique design!!! The shipping was very fast ! I am very happy with my purchase!!!!
So happy with these....like elegant fried eggs (a compliment I assume you). Every piece of jewellery I have bought to date from Greek vendors on Etsy have been so well made and a cut above the rest.
"I've been wearing this in the third hole in my left ear, so it climbs a little higher up the back of my ear. It's slightly too big for this, but I don't mind. Clearly, it's shown on the model fully on the earlobe instead of the back of the ear. I love this piece so much. It's gorgeous and I've been wearing it really often with another pair of earrings from this seller."
"These are subtle and beautiful, great for anyone who wants to try ear pins but doesn't want a look that is ""in your face."" Shipping was extremely fast, and seller stayed in communication throughout the whole process. Wonderful experience!"
"I love these earrings! They are just as pictured, came in a cute little package, and arrived quickly. I get so many compliments on them!"
"Came promptly! I love this ear climber, although Ill be purchasing the left ear as well now - it looks kinda funky just wearing the one."
Delicate but edgy! I've gotten alot of compliments on this piece and told ppl about SeoulLittle! This piece is easy to wear and lightweight
Absolutely gorgeous and so delicate and light catching! (I am referring to the silver triangle ear climbers). My new favorite jewelry shop on Etsy! So lovely and very high quality.
I just received these in silver today and they're gorgeous and high quality! I also love the container they came in as well as the personalized note. Love these!! :)
These earrings are so cute and delicate and I have gotten so many compliments already on them! One of them broke (I did say they are delicate) and Charlotte sent an replacement right away! Great product and awesome customer service! Thank you!
Wore this for Halloween as part of my 1920's flapper costume. Loved it! Very well made and authentic looking. Comfy too :)
Absolutely in love with my ear climbers! I have super sensitive earlobes so the hypoallergenic aspect was huge for me. I've worn them all day without any issues. Perfect size and color. Very sturdy. I love the velvet box it came in! Will definitely order from this store again. üòä
Great item! Had a blast wearing it to a Great Gasby party. Thx!
The shipping was speedy! Had to go cross-country from New York to Los Angles and arrived on time for my daughters birthday!
"Je suis hyper satisfaite ! Je ne porte plus de boucles d‚Äôoreille depuis des ann√©es mais celles-ci sont discr√®tes et hyper confortables (je les garde pour dormir). Elles sont super jolies et viennent dans une petite bo√Æte tr√®s cute ! Bref, je recommande grandement +++"
Je les adore! J‚Äôai eu de beaux compliments en les portant üòä
"Je les adore! √âpur√©es, magnifiques! Produit de qualit√©!"
"Simples et si f√©minines, je les ADORE üòçüòç"
"These are my absolute favorite pair of earings!!! I love them and have gotten so many compliments on them!!! The packaging was so beautiful as well, I wish I could post noimore photos. You won't regret ordering these beauties!!"
"I received so many compliments on my earrings and recommended this store to all of my friends. The design is modern, chic and dainty at the same time. Great quality from a local business (I discovered upon receipt just how close we are!) :-)"
Really love my new earrings. I love that they are light weight! I contacted the seller and she was quick to answer my questions and even added in some care instructions. Super happy and highly recommend.
My new fav earrings! I love how you can mix and match and swap them around with other earrings for different looks.
"The silver phoenix ear climbers are beautiful! Just as pictured. It's tough to find anything new and unique to wear on my ears, but these are definitely that. Lots of comments and compliments! Love them!"
"Die Ohrringe sind wirklich wundersch√∂n! Meine besten St√ºcke! Die Bestellung war wegen Corona sehr lange unterwegs, die Verk√§uferin stand aber im regen Austausch mit mir und antwortete umgehend auf Mails und verfolgte die Sendung mit. Tolle Betreuung! Thank you so much!"
"Beautiful earrings! I didn‚Äôt measure my ears before purchase, and I appear to have enormous ears, so they sit a bit low. I have had an extra piercing put in, so they will sit in the best place. I‚Äôll post a picture once the hole heals!"
These are awesome earrings very sturdy I wear them to bed even get lots of compliments and they shipped fast thank you so much there gorgeous
"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus"
"Absolutely gorgeous earrings, very robust with good strong fastenings but at the same time the metal work is really delicate and feminine. The gold catches the light and makes them sparkle too. They are my new favourite earrings...I love them!"
"Stunning earrings, have worn them almost everyday since I got them, I love them. Excellent quality and beautifully made. Arrived quickly with zero issues!"
These are beautiful and look great and really unique on. Fresh take on boring old earrings. So fashionable. I love them!
I absolutely love the earrings they look gorgeous. I have several ear holes with tiny hoops so it's not super easy to have the earrings straight and they are not practical to wear with a mask but they look great and they're totally worth it!
"Beautifully crafted! Ethiopian Opal 14k Gold Filled ear climbers, Opal flashy green fire ear crawlers, gemstone Opal ear pin, Opal ear vine ear cuff sweep"
So beautiful. Well made. Beautiful stones with flashes of colour. They are even prettier in person! Thank you!
"Beautifully crafted! Was amazed at how it was even more stunning when I held the actual earrings! Fast delivery (despite the holiday rush, might I add!~), and incredibly helpful service through any concerns; will definitely be a loyal patron, and cannot wait to see this exceptional artisan's jewelry line grow!~ Again, happy holidays, and hope 2018 brings more happiness along with new inspirations and designs!~ :)"
More beautiful than described. Bought them for my sister and she's in love with them! She finally has ear jewelry that she can wear that doesn't break her out. Thanks!
The creative idea of these earrings is amazing! Giovanna Racca is very kind and attentive to the customer. The shipment is arrived very fastly. I'm very satisfied.
"When you wear these unique earrings, you are guaranteed many compliments! It took a bit to get them in the mail, but the wait was worth it‚ù£Ô∏è"
I absolutely love my marble earrings. Just what I was looking for! Thank you Giovanna!
The creative idea of these earrings is amazing! Giovanna Racca is very kind and attentive to the customer. The shipment is arrived very fastly. I'm very satisfied.
"I love everything lavender, so these were prefect! I just had a baby recently and she is now grabbing at things...she won't be able to pull these! Arrived in a timely manner considering Covid and the fact that they came from across the world. V The attention to detail is awesome, I got them in the rustic silver. I'll update with a picture later. I am a happy client!"
"Since these are made to order, be prepared to be patient. They are well worth it! They look even better in person and are so comfortable I forget I‚Äôm wearing them! I feel like I have a bit of nature preserved and adorning my ears. Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy from this shop!"
"Beautiful earrings, even prettier than in the pictures. Great quality and craftsmanship. Nicely wrapped and they made for a great present to myself :) My favourite pair so far"
"This is actually the send time I‚Äôve purchased these, this time as a gift. I can‚Äôt wait to give them! I have people comment on my pair all the time and I know these will be loved as well. They are by far the most comfortable earrings I have ever worn and are unique yet go with anything. Thank you!!!"
"I love these they are beautiful, thank you x"
I wore these on my wedding day and they were just absolutely stunning! Matched my ring perfectly!
"These are the most authentic looking, beautiful earrings! They made me feel like a millionairess at a very exclusive pool in Newport Beach! My friends were super jealous of my earrings and bathing suit look! Thank you for another beautiful piece of quality jewelry! Can't wait to see my coasters!"
These are going to be worn next month fir my wedding. I also ordered the matching necklace. The quality is amazing!!
"Beautiful ear climbers! Arrived quickly, looks exactly as pictured and of very high quality! I would recommend this shop to anyone looking for good quality ear climbers."
"These are awesome. I have the tendency to put earrings in and forget about them, which is exactly what I did with these. I‚Äôve worn them for at least 2 weeks straight now, they‚Äôve been in the shower with me and there is no sign of tarnishing. They‚Äôre still shined and silver. Simple and beautiful! Would buy here again"
"I did like the eating, however it‚Äôs not as pictured. The hoop was thinner than I expected and I don‚Äôt really like how easy it is to bend the metal. In fact, the instructions say to bend the metal in order to make them fit properly. I just wish it was a little thicker and had a more secure clasp system. The spike is more subtle than pictured, which I actually preferred. Over all, I just wanted a slightly thicker hoop and possibly a different clasp."
They are beautiful! Very detailed and the quality is outstanding! I cannot wait to wear these out! I am sure I will get lots of comments and will tell them where I got them! - bought as a set so I have the same review on the other earrings!!
Boucles d'oreilles ravissantes. Conformes √† ce que je voulais.
Les boucles sont tr√®s jolies et donne un bon rendu. Je recommande creamelanie. Tr√®s satisfaite.
Je suis tr√®s satisfait de cet achat qui est un cadeau pour ma s≈ìur. Le bijou m‚Äôa √©t√© envoy√© tr√®s rapidement (malgr√© les conditions actuelles) et les contacts ont √©t√© tr√®s agr√©ables. La qualit√© est superbe et conforme aux attentes. C‚Äôest fin et c‚Äôest tr√®s joli. Je recommande !
"Love my necklace. It's perfect. Definitely get one. Everywhere I go, people ask about it. ü•∞"
"Love these earrings! I did have to use little stoppers on the ends bc I didn‚Äôt feel them secure enough, but they‚Äôre so beautiful!! Thank you!"
Beautiful earrings. The climbers have a long back piece that is more narrow at the base than at the top. I think it is designed this way to help secure them in place but my lobe is slightly big for the narrow part. It doesn't cause much of an issue just every so often they pop out of place a bit. They took a bit of adjusting to see how they fit best on my lobe. Otherwise they look and feel great! I have been admiring these for a while so I was happy to finally take the plunge and be satisfied with my purchase :-)
"These are my new favorite earrings. They are great quality, feel really nice, and are exactly as pictured. They are funky and eye catching without the dangle."
"I love these earrings so much they have been the only earrings I have worn in the past 2+ years. They dont bother me when sleeping, which was my main reason for buying, and always look great. The only reason I‚Äôve had to buy earrings since I first got a pair from here is because I have had them occasionally fall out and get lost- so I just replace them (love that I can buy one at a time)! All styles of the climber earrings at this shop get five stars from me. Shipping is fast and the packaging is lovely. Can‚Äôt recommend enough."
"These earrings are very cool. My first ""ear climbers"" - something nice for a change from hoops and dangles. Well made, as described, and really decent ship time from the UK to Florida, USA. Thanks!"
"Another pair of beautifully made ear climbers. The quality is so good, I wouldn't know they were made from recycled materials but that's a big plus for me. Keep up the excellent work!"
"I love these! Shipped the day I bought them and arrived 2 days later, very impressive. They‚Äôre lovely, good quality and I‚Äôm very pleased! Thank you üòä"
"These earrings look lovely on, I've had lots of compliments about them and lots of enquiries about where I bought them - I'm very pleased with them"
"There are not enough words to express my appreciation for this seller's beautiful creations and more importantly the caring, attention and genuine kindness that comes with each item they sell. You will likely be thrilled with whatever you get from this shop, but if there are any issues at all, you can rest assured they will work very hard to help find the best and most prompt solutions for their customers. These folks care and we need LOTS more of that in today's world!"
"I‚Äôm SO PUMPED about this ring set. Absolutely worth the money, and true to size. The only negative thing about the whole experience is that India Post doesn‚Äôt update their shipping log often, so I had about three weeks where I had no clue what was happening with my package üòÖ other than that, the quality of this ring is flawless! I love it!"
"I AM IN LOVE! I have an oval diamond engagement ring and had not been able to find a guard to fit correctly. I had been following Abhika Jewels on Etsy for awhile and saved a few rings as inspiration. My husband wanted to get me my dream guard for our anniversary and I messaged Madhulika. She was so quick to respond and give me different options once I told her what ideas I had. I got the ring in less than a month and I am stunned. It fits so perfectly - how can she do this just off a few pictures? I am so, so happy with how it turned out and I feel so lucky to have something made custom for my ring. If you have an idea, please reach out to this team. You won‚Äôt be disappointed! THANK YOU!"
"Madhulika was so communicative and very timely with their responses. Their specific instructions on what they needed from me for customization made the entire process super easy. And I was completely blown away, in love, extremely pleased with the end result. It quite literally looks like it was made for my Olive Ave. engagement ring. It is something I will always cherish and look forward to passing down to future generations! ü•∞"
"Ces boucles sont vraiment jolies, elles ont du succ√®s aupr√®s de mes amies ! Livraison soign√©e !"
"Tr√®s contente de mon achat, le travail est minutieux, le papier est magnifique! Arriv√© rapidement dans un emballage soign√©. je recommande cette cr√©atrice!"
"Tr√®s satisfait de mon achat, le travail est minutieux et le rendu est superbe. C'est un beau cadeau √† offrir !"
J'aime beaucoup les boucles d'oreille ! Livraison rapide dans un bel emballage :)
This is such a unique piece! I wore it for my celestial-themed wedding and got so many nice compliments. A very special addition to my wardrobe on my special day. :)
"Initially awkward to put on, but now I have got the hang of it (I had to refer to the pics). Nevertheless, this was the most accurate Cancer Zodiac Constellation earrings that I found (6 stars, rather than 5). 10/10 for the tracked DHL courier delivery to the UK."
Such great quality earrings! I absolutely love them. They are just a tiny bit too big for my ear shape but I don‚Äôt mind too much. And it didn‚Äôt take too long to get to me.
"It shipped on time, and I love these! They're very pretty, and look good on me. The only problem I had was trying to put them in. Perhaps instructions should come with orders? Nevertheless, these are amazing!"
"Wonderful. Great quality, have not had any adverse reactions to the product. Very easy to put in and the perfect size. Large enough to see but not where its overbearing on my ear. I really love the look of the hammered silver texture on the front of the earring. Very easy to lose heads up!"
I love these earrings!! I‚Äôve had them for quite a few months and they are comfortable and very pretty. I keep getting compliments because of them. Definitely unique and good quality. I‚Äôm very happy with them and would by more in the future.
"I ordered these for myself and absolutely love them !!! They are comfortable to wear ! I never wear earrings to bed because earring backs have always bothered me but I did not have an issue with these at all ! I reached out to the shop because shipping was taking a little longer than expected and they replied the same day and were extremely helpful! (Delays were due to the postal service , not the shops problem)"
Love them. üòç
Beautiful earrings! They‚Äôre exactly as described. I love them already :)
"Wundersch√∂n, sehen aus wie in der Beschreibung! Super schnelle Lieferung."
"tolles Design, schnelle Lieferung, netter Kontakt"
"Very pretty and dainty. Not overwhelmingly punk but still punk enough if you have to go to work and still want to do you. The ball post studs are shorter than all my other studs, so they do fit a bit snug, so I am using them with my other posts. They look good with everything."
"Absolutely amazing, thank you so much for this beautiful ear studs!!! Regards from Austria ?"
"Slightly smaller than photo and hole was too small for my diamond screwbacks. Seller was very helpful though and made hole larger, but it still didn't fit, so I purchased morganite studs to pair with them instead. It is beautiful and I get lots of compliments."
"Absolutely perfect, love these, they look beautiful!"
Absolutely stunning. I got the necklace and matching bracelet. Love it!
Gorgeous!
These earrings are super pretty! I had some initial issues with my order and Carolina was awesome about communicating with me and sending me a new package! The second package arrived super fast and with a free gift too!
My sister absolutely loved the twig ear climbers. She did well not to open them when they arrived four days before her birthday. The service was excellent. Thank you!
Another awesome purchase from this great seller!! Thank you very much for the cool midi ring and the incredible ear climbers. I'm so happy with the things you make me!!!
"Absolute fine work!! Shipping, contact with the shop, everything excellent!"
"The earrings are marvellous, I bought them as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she was completely amazed, she loved them. I'd like to congratulate you and I highly recommend this shop."
Hermosos! üòç
"I‚Äôm not one to leave reviews, but I thought it would help the next one who falls in love online with these ear climbers. All the reviews on them are amazing. When I received them, they were beautiful and I couldn‚Äôt have been happier. The first time I wore both of them as a pair and the gem fell right into my drink in front of friends. The second time I wore just the one with m hair up, and it wasn‚Äôt until I adjusted my mirror in my car that I noticed after a few hours two gems were missing out that one too. So embarrassing. I really wanted to love these, but I would remove from cart and spend your money elsewhere."
"Wow, Lalia!!!!!! Wow! Thank you so much for honoring my request and shipping so quickly. The quality and beauty of these earrings are incredible. Truly, they are the only earrings that have not infected my sensitive ears, and also very easy to insert. I've searched several handmade and other sites looking for 'the right' pair for me, and these are it! They really are one of a kind and perfect. I will be in contact soon for more requests! :-) Thank you again!!!"
These earrings are so beautiful- the color is gorgeous! They feel very secure and I get so many compliments on them. Highly recommend them!
"Great items. Ear jacket is the perfect size. A bit hard to put on first time but it's very elegant looking . The small earrings are dainty and beautiful, have enough detail despite their size. Both stay put in ears. The metal backs of the earrings were hurting me so I replaced with rubber backs. Seller shipped quickly and prices are fair. Awesome purchase!"
Second pair. Love this shop! My 1st pair was the black in this style and now I have the gold. So so so many compliments on these at work! Thank you
Same as the other earrings I ordered. I love the way they look once I get them on. They're difficult for me to put on because of the three holes on the jacket piece - it's hard to get them even. The back is extremely small and I have trouble getting it on and off. But they are really pretty once I finally get them on. I will enjoy wearing them.
"These are great! I love the adjustable backing. Turns out my ears are different sizes, so they need to be on different holes but they still look even."
"Love them! As usual. Such fantastic quality, this is my 5th pair and definitely not my last. Thanks!"
"I L.O.V.E. these earrings! I have gotten so many compliments on them! I have super sensitive ears, but I have not had 1 problem with these earrings! I would definitely purchase again! They were quick, efficient, and the product was in great shape! Thanks!"
I bought for daughters Xmas gift. Perfect size for smaller ears. Love the color and exceptional quality!
Super cute earrings! Fits my ear perfectly since I have pretty small ears.
"The earrings are wonderful! The first time I wore them, someone asked me if I'd had my ears double-pierced. Ha! They're well-made, with both tips perfectly rounded, and although they're thin and light-weight, they seem substantial when you handle them. They were shipped quickly, so I'm very pleased!"
"Absolutely amazing! So in love with every single piece I own from Otis Jaxon. Incredible designs, high quality and unique. Thank you."
Love these. Really interesting on the ear. I got the triangles and am so pleased.
"It took 25 days to arrive to Nashville, Tennessee. I was expecting it sooner. However, they are cool earrings. They don‚Äôt look great from the front since they bow out - I notice a pic from the front isn‚Äôt included - but it‚Äôs still a unique piece of jewelry that will garner some attention if viewed from the side as shown. Had some difficulty figuring out how to put it on at first as the instructions weren‚Äôt helpful. Pics of how to slip it on and flip it would be helpful as well as a pic of the back of the ear."
"Seller is very responsive and offers great advice! I requested an oxidized ""black"" finish on these ear jackets, and the seller talked me through her process and gave me tips for how to polish, lighten the black, clean/care for the earrings, and more. Very impressive and kind of her! And of course the final product came out lovely with the darker finish instead of a polished silver color, they are less flashy but in a very elegant way that stands out without being obvious, so I love it. Wonderful transaction all the way, thank you so much! I chose the DHL shipping and it was lightning fast, mostly I was shocked/happy with how quickly the seller was able to create the pieces and get them to the carrier--that is service at a high level. As such I can say, buy with confidence! You will not be disappointed."
Absolutely gorgeous! These are some of the most strikingly beautiful earrings I've ever owned. They arrived in a very unique way too. Great communication with the seller as well. Quickly delivered.
These earrings are a work of art! I received many compliments when I wore them.
This is my second pair. Love the larger size. Workmanship is impeccable.

"I ordered these Hammered Matte Sterling Silver and they fit my ears that have never worked with climbers before fit in 13.5mm perfectly! I'm amazed how they fit so well and I just guessed that length. I think I'm going to order them a tiny bit longer in matte, I got another pair in matte & they're gorgeous! Definitely recommend!"
"On the good side. They were an absolutely adorable design! Came in a great package. Very thoughtful touches! Sadly, even though these are titled as being precious metal, sterling/14k (which I have worn my entire life, with no issue) in the description. They immediately irritated my ears, like lesser quality metals, always have. I tried to give them a chance, but my ears ended up so irritated, they became too painful to wear. After a few more attempts, I had to throw them away, and bought a sterling silver pair from another vendor, and have not had issues. Great little earrings! Just make sure you don't need proper precious metal, and you will love them!!"
"Love my climber earrings in both gold and silver! Delicate, but the hammered effects really refract and throw the light beautifully! Fast shipping, too. Thank you. Highly recommended."
"So simple, pretty and unique. Takes a minute to figure out how to put them in the first time, but it's simple enough. Love them!"
"Love these earrings! I did have to use little stoppers on the ends bc I didn‚Äôt feel them secure enough, but they‚Äôre so beautiful!! Thank you!"
Beautiful earrings. The climbers have a long back piece that is more narrow at the base than at the top. I think it is designed this way to help secure them in place but my lobe is slightly big for the narrow part. It doesn't cause much of an issue just every so often they pop out of place a bit. They took a bit of adjusting to see how they fit best on my lobe. Otherwise they look and feel great! I have been admiring these for a while so I was happy to finally take the plunge and be satisfied with my purchase :-)
"These are my new favorite earrings. They are great quality, feel really nice, and are exactly as pictured. They are funky and eye catching without the dangle."
"I love these earrings so much they have been the only earrings I have worn in the past 2+ years. They dont bother me when sleeping, which was my main reason for buying, and always look great. The only reason I‚Äôve had to buy earrings since I first got a pair from here is because I have had them occasionally fall out and get lost- so I just replace them (love that I can buy one at a time)! All styles of the climber earrings at this shop get five stars from me. Shipping is fast and the packaging is lovely. Can‚Äôt recommend enough."
"This is the second ring I asked to be made for me, I contacted Valentini to see if there was a purple colour available & if she could make this ring slightly differently to add a variation to the one that I already have. She responded to my questions promptly & kept me updated with the making of the ring, also sent me a photo of some of the purple colours that she had available for me to choose from. I honestly cannot recommend this seller & shop enough, such quality items with a very fast dispatch & very well packaged in a pretty yet sturdy way as to not get damaged in transit. If you have any questions just go ahead & ask you will definitely not be disappointed with this seller or any of the products she makes. A+++"
"Well, where can I start to explain just how amazing not only this seller is but the craftsmanship that has gone into making this ring. The seller answered all of my questions promptly, also made the ring to my requirements, it's absolutely stunning, simply beautiful & effective, well made also dispatched quickly & it arrived in next to no time. I would definitely recommend this seller & her craftsmanship, so don't delay just buy, you won't regret it."
These earrings are very pretty!!! They are very well made and they have a unique design!!! The shipping was very fast ! I am very happy with my purchase!!!!
So happy with these....like elegant fried eggs (a compliment I assume you). Every piece of jewellery I have bought to date from Greek vendors on Etsy have been so well made and a cut above the rest.
"There are not enough words to express my appreciation for this seller's beautiful creations and more importantly the caring, attention and genuine kindness that comes with each item they sell. You will likely be thrilled with whatever you get from this shop, but if there are any issues at all, you can rest assured they will work very hard to help find the best and most prompt solutions for their customers. These folks care and we need LOTS more of that in today's world!"
"I‚Äôm SO PUMPED about this ring set. Absolutely worth the money, and true to size. The only negative thing about the whole experience is that India Post doesn‚Äôt update their shipping log often, so I had about three weeks where I had no clue what was happening with my package üòÖ other than that, the quality of this ring is flawless! I love it!"
"I AM IN LOVE! I have an oval diamond engagement ring and had not been able to find a guard to fit correctly. I had been following Abhika Jewels on Etsy for awhile and saved a few rings as inspiration. My husband wanted to get me my dream guard for our anniversary and I messaged Madhulika. She was so quick to respond and give me different options once I told her what ideas I had. I got the ring in less than a month and I am stunned. It fits so perfectly - how can she do this just off a few pictures? I am so, so happy with how it turned out and I feel so lucky to have something made custom for my ring. If you have an idea, please reach out to this team. You won‚Äôt be disappointed! THANK YOU!"
"Madhulika was so communicative and very timely with their responses. Their specific instructions on what they needed from me for customization made the entire process super easy. And I was completely blown away, in love, extremely pleased with the end result. It quite literally looks like it was made for my Olive Ave. engagement ring. It is something I will always cherish and look forward to passing down to future generations! ü•∞"
I have not received this order. 3/18/2019
Boucles pendantes tr√®s sympas. Un peu longues pour moi mais faciles √† raccourcir.
Exactly as the foto. I love them!!
Achet√©es pour ma fille. Parfaites pour les premi√®res boucles pendantes d'une petite princesse !
"These are gorgeous! The seller was very helpful and moved the position of the post for me. Shipping was very fast, and these came beautifully packaged in a jewelry box inside a velvet bag. Super happy with my purchases from this seller!"
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!
Je les adores ! Elles sont tr√®s belles et de qualit√©
Received these very promptly and they are beautiful! I really like them and have been wearing them for a few days now and get so many compliments.
Beautiful and just as pictured. Love the way they look! Thank you!
"Love, love, love! Great service too!!"
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."
"Beautiful earrings, exactly as pictured. There was a delay in the Post, but Panagiotis did everything to accommodate me. He sent off a new set of earrings (which will now be returned) since the original shipment finally arrived to Canada from Greece. What a wonderful person to deal with! I highly recommend this jewelry and seller. Thank you!"
"The earrings look exactly as they did in the photos. The backs are bent in such a way that they really stay in the correct position on your ears, but they're not difficult to put on. They were beautifully packaged, too. I love them! They're very unique."
"thought they looked hot in the pic.......well, even better in real life.........these earings are just fab!!!!"
My daughter loved her gift! Very stylish!
Thank you very much! It's so beautiful and unique!! I love it.
It was a bday gift and you literally saved me with your super speedy delivery and help throughout. Amazing earrings - my friend loved them! Cant recommend enough. Will defo purchase from you again!
"These earrings are exquisite ! Simple, elegant, I love they ! Thanks so much !"
Exactly as described! They are light and beautiful. I bought them for my 14 yr old daughter and she loves them!
Exactly what I thought they would be and I love wearing them!
"Full discloser: I haven't worn them yet, so I don't feel that I can give a 5 star rating at this time. It hasn't quite been a month since I got my ears pierced. Just a bit longer and then they can be shown off! I feel fierce, Art Deco-esque vibes just looking at them. I love that these are lightweight earrings. They won't contribute to sagging earlobes later. The design is unique. Nina is very friendly, professional and helpful."
Beautiful earrings!
Super cute earrings. Great Customer Service. Overseas shipping flawless. Great Communication. 5* seller. Thanks so much.
Soooo pretty. Even better than expected. Very well-made and delicate. Thank you!
I really like the concept of jacket earrings and these r cute but much much smaller than they appear in picture. I'm keeping them. I dont think it's the sellers fault; couldn't get a good feel for size in pic. They are cute and I will wear them and buy more from this seller.
Versand ging schneller als erwartet. K√∂nnt gerne auch aus Deutschland bestellen. War alles √ºberhaupt kein Problem. Hatte die Ohrringe schon nach zwei Wochen. Sie sind wundersch√∂n. Liebe sie!!
LOVE!!!
Je ne peux plus vivre sans!!!! Trop tendance et simple √† la fois ! Je n'ai que des compliments!
J adore j adore !!! Je re√ßois plein de compliment sur cette boucle d oreille üíïüíï merci Patricia
"Beautiful ear climbers! Arrived quickly, looks exactly as pictured and of very high quality! I would recommend this shop to anyone looking for good quality ear climbers."
"These are awesome. I have the tendency to put earrings in and forget about them, which is exactly what I did with these. I‚Äôve worn them for at least 2 weeks straight now, they‚Äôve been in the shower with me and there is no sign of tarnishing. They‚Äôre still shined and silver. Simple and beautiful! Would buy here again"
"I did like the eating, however it‚Äôs not as pictured. The hoop was thinner than I expected and I don‚Äôt really like how easy it is to bend the metal. In fact, the instructions say to bend the metal in order to make them fit properly. I just wish it was a little thicker and had a more secure clasp system. The spike is more subtle than pictured, which I actually preferred. Over all, I just wanted a slightly thicker hoop and possibly a different clasp."
They are beautiful! Very detailed and the quality is outstanding! I cannot wait to wear these out! I am sure I will get lots of comments and will tell them where I got them! - bought as a set so I have the same review on the other earrings!!
So far this item is exactly as I pictured. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong side because I wasn't paying attention to where the post was located on the earring. I currently wear it down where as in the picture it looks worn up. I will be ordering the other side so I can wear as shown in the picture. Would recommend!
I am in love with this earring!
It took a little while to get here but now that It's here I love it! I was slightly worried it would be too long but it sits in a nice spot on my ear and ends right at my conch. It even came with a cute sticker :) Very pleased to finally have something fun in my helix
"This piece is beautiful and I absolutely love it!!! There was a bit of a hiccup with the post office in delivery, but Melanie was incredibly helpful and accommodating!"
"Ces boucles sont vraiment jolies, elles ont du succ√®s aupr√®s de mes amies ! Livraison soign√©e !"
"Tr√®s contente de mon achat, le travail est minutieux, le papier est magnifique! Arriv√© rapidement dans un emballage soign√©. je recommande cette cr√©atrice!"
"Tr√®s satisfait de mon achat, le travail est minutieux et le rendu est superbe. C'est un beau cadeau √† offrir !"
J'aime beaucoup les boucles d'oreille ! Livraison rapide dans un bel emballage :)
These earrings are so cute! Exactly as advertised. Fast shipping and the packing was so cute. I also loved the personalized thank you card. Would highly recommend!!! I will 100% would purchase again from this shop.
They are perfect! I have had several complements seeing as I work in a Veterinary clinic. Thank you for the fast shipping!
Completely obsessed with these earrings. I got a pair for me (just got a black kitten) and a pair for my mother in law who owns a Siamese. The ‚Äúwhite‚Äù kitty earrings are more Siamese looking to me so they are perfect and I know she will love them. The handwritten card was so cute and thoughtful as well. The baggies the earrings came with are also adorable and make for a great gift. Thank you Kellan & Keira!
I will be back again to buy more ! Super cute and the card that came with them felt so nice and personal!!!
My daughter wore this for her 8th grade graduation and received so many compliments.
"It is gorgeous, worth the wait!!"
"What a fun ear cuff! Bright colors, unusual design and comfortable to wear! What else could you ask for?"
"A beautiful, adjustable statement piece! I have received many compliments on this ear cuff."
These are my new favorite ear rings! So original and made really well. Beautiful and simple.
"Nice, long thread, not as great as I would have picked if in person."
Poor quality Earring for a newborn not an adult Gave the earrings to next door neighbor 2 year old daughter
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
"I so much love my new pair of very elegant and stylish clear crystal ear climbers. Their so well made and look like the real thing. The Crystal ear climbers are a great statement piece that can be worn dressy or casual and will make any outfit look amazing. The purchase and shipping was a very pleasant experience, will be purchasing more items from this company/ brand again!!! Thank You, Gretchen"
This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are
I received this a few days ago. I also purchased the white gold for the left ear. I am so beyond happy with these. They are stunningly pretty and fit perfectly on my ears. I also have very sensitive ears and certain earrings can cause irritation but that doesn‚Äôt happen with these at all! Love them!
In love and I need more!!! Thankyouuuuu
"Very quick shipping. The earrings are so pretty and I have been getting so many compliments on them. My Mom loved them so much that she asked me to order a pair for her, which I did right on the spot, last night :) So I've ordered 2 pairs in less than a week and plan to order some more items soon!"
"Don‚Äôt mind my red ear but, Super cute! Comfy. Hangs off sometimes but it‚Äôs not a problem. Comes with rubber backing to make it comfortable. Shipped fine."
These are so cute... even the packaging was cute! Great craftsmanship
Je suis ravie ! La commande a √©t√© exp√©di√©e en 24h et est arriv√©e en environ 15 jours. Les boucles d‚Äôoreilles sont parfaitement conformes √† la description et correspondent tout √† fait √† ce que je souhaitais ! Je vais d√®s √† pr√©sent ajouter d‚Äôautres articles dans ma wishlist pour une future commande !
"I bought these for 9 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves them! She loves how they look like she has a second piercing and how they twinkle on her ears. I‚Äôm a huge fan as well, absolutely adorable on her :) this is her first pair of ear climbers and now not her last. Well made and exactly as described. Thank you!"
"Literally have gotten five climber earrings from this shop in the past few weeks. I‚Äôm in complete love. Amazing quality and work, fast shipping too. Thank you so much!!!"
I'm from the US and met a girl from Canada a few months back. We have Zoom dates once a week and for Valentine's Day I wanted to get her something that had to do with her favorite flower. She absolutely loved them ‚ù§
"Love, love, loooove these earrings!!! I ordered the babies breath ear climbers-they‚Äôre perfect!! I didn‚Äôt want just plain climbers & i didn‚Äôt want a fancy pair full of diamonds....these are the perfect in between I‚Äôve been looking for!! Easy ordering & fast shipment, too."
"I just received the cuff earring. It‚Äôs dainty and beautiful! So pleased. Highly recommend. Working from home, so nice to get this package delivered today from Israel!"
"Amazing! Such sparkle and so very comfortable. It's elegant, sexy, and fun all at once. Very well made and seller is wonderful to communicate with; it also arrived practically overnight - Thank You!"
Love my ring exactly what I wanted. Super fast work & shipping.
The necklace is beautiful! I received it in no time. Service was impeccable and just perfect. Best Xmas gift.
Very happy with my 2.1 mm 16 in. Paper clip chain. Arrived quickly. Layered here with a 17in necklace.
Its beautiful! With the length and size I ordered its perfect for everyday wear without it being over the top!
"Exactly as promised, this 4.6mm X 24 inch 10K solid gold Figaro chain was delivered in a timely manner by USPS. The purchase amount was lower than I've seen elsewhere, so I consider this durable, easy-to-wear chain a very good value - costing hundreds instead of thousands. Thanks! - Perfect size for pendants."
"Be aware the links are hollow NOT solid gold. I ordered the 18‚Äù chain with 4.2mm links. It is a good looking chain, however, it also feels very light, due to the hollow nature of the links. In fact, there is a small, deep cut/trench along the inside of each link. I had a seamless shopping experience and it shipped quickly."
"I love it! It‚Äôs just like the pic! Althought mine came with a mark on it, like it was pressed and a part crumbled a bit, you cant really see it, so no problem. I also loved the message in the box and the fact the seller is eco-friendly and choses recycled and simple pack, which I do appreciate. 5 stars for her!"
"These are my favorite earrings and I wear them almost daily. I have second and third lobe piercings, but I prefer these instead. They often slip out of position on one side (mostly just when I sleep), but I think that‚Äôs just because of the location of my piercing/size of my lobe compared to the width of the earring. I suggest taking them out before you shower, because I have come close to losing them down the drain a few times!"
"Very nice, just like the photos. I have metal allergies but these earrings do not bother me at all."
Lovely earrings. I can't wait to gift these to my bridesmaids.
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©"
"I ADORE the white topaz ear pins! I bought a pair instead of just the one. I wore them out to dinner last night and I was stopped by several people and asked about them. I have my ears pierced 15 times, so ear cuffs and crawlers dont really work for me. I will definitely be ordering some more similar items from this shop. Beautiful!"
Beautiful ear cuff looks amazing in the ear and very fast delivery too. I think I may have to order another one very soon :) A+++++++ for quality and service.
"These are as beautiful as I had hoped and I loved, loved, loved the personalized card! I wish you a wonderful 2017 and thank you so much for these wonderful earrings."
I love them!!!
These are gorgeous! Arrived on time and beautifully packaged. Thanks so much - MMR
very nice earrings!!!
Just beautiful. I've had a lot of comments asking where I got them and pointed them in your direction. Thank you! Good quick delivery too. xxx
"Great earrings, great style! They are delicate, very elegant and so original but a bit smaller than expected. They come in their own little box. I get hundreds of compliments when wearing them!"
"As always, beautiful product, fast international shipping. I get most of my earrings from Shlomit Ofir, and I get so many compliments! Love this designer."
Vendeuse √† l'√©coute et tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles. Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de cet achat.
I love the look of these but they are super thin and bend really easily.
These are pretty but very fragile. I don't think I will have them long. The wire bends as you put them in your ears. But... They are very pretty!
Super cute.
"Cutest earrings ever!! and they arrived super quickly. I love them so much, thank you!"
It arrived earlier than I expected....it looks perfect on the sweater that I got it for!!! Just wish it was 1/2 and inch larger.
"La broche est vraiment jolie et d√©licate, c'est pratiquement un bijou ! L'√©ventail est un peu plus petit que ce que je pensais -j'avais pourtant vu les dimensions sur le site...- mais le rendu est tr√®s beau. Le vendeur a r√©pondu tr√®s gentiment √† toutes mes questions et l'article est arriv√© tr√®s rapidement. Je suis contente de mon achat."
Ravie de mon achat! La broche est jolie et les finitions soign√©es... L'envoi s'est fait sans probl√®me: le colis est arriv√© tr√®s vite et l'emballage prot√©geait parfaitement le bijou! Encore merci!
"Tr√®s joli en bleu aussi. Celle-ci est pour ma fille, je lui offrirai √† No√´l. Elle ne porte pas de broche habituellement mais je suis certaine que l'√©l√©gance et la finesse de celle-ci lui plairont. Tr√®s beau travail. Excellente exp√©rience avec cette boutique. Si les petits √©ventails vous tentent n'h√©sitez pas !"
Love love love these earrings! Beautifully made good quality. I wear mine as a climber and it looks great.
Love these earrings ‚ù£Ô∏è
I really love it! For my tiny ears it probably would be better if both arrows were a little bit smaller. The dimensions between lobe holes is perfect but they are a little long for my small ear. But that just means I may need to order more in a custom size üòâ truly love them!
"This is my favorite thing I‚Äôve purchased from Etsy like EVER! Nicely packaged, makes you excited to open it. So many nice touches to the packaging. The earrings are well made and easier to put in than I thought and more comfortable than I thought they‚Äôd be. I will never take these off! ALSO amidst all of the coronavirus stuff, they came in a reasonable time frame!"
OMG it is so darn cute! only had it a couple days and everyone loves it! Amazing !!! The fastest shipping. I had it in two days! I will be a returning customer!
I purchased the arrow ear climbers. They are adorable and beautifully made.
It took a minute to get in situated on my ear but once it was on it didn't budge and looked great! Several of my coworkers commented on how pretty it is.
I love how unique this was. I wore it today at work and revived lots of complements. Thank you!! Ordered more jewelry and can't wait to get it. :)
"I am completely in love with both my pair of earrings/earcrawlers and the single one I bought! I highly recommend Monica‚Äôs designs & will be back for more, myself. üíú"
"Added to my HarshandSweet collection with these - perfect for distracting people from my lockdown hair. The iridescent colours are lovely, they're great quality and arrived quickly."
I love these earrings! They fit perfectly and never slip. I just slip them in and go. The color and size are exactly what I had hoped for
Love them! Small but perfectly formed and the colours are lovely.
"ORIGINAL , LEGER ET FACILE A PORTER"
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles. Merci beaucoup!
"Longueur parfaite, belles mati√®res, brillantes, color√©es üíñ"
"These are earrings I wear every day, clean once in a while and put back in. They are perfect for me! I have several ear holes and these go in the bottom. It took a long time for them to get to me... but worth the wait! Love them. Exactly as pictured. Great shop!"
"Very delicate piece of work. I absolutely love the versatility and design of this earring! And it arrived in less than 10 days. The only thing I don‚Äôt love that much is putting it and removing it - as it has three pieces and they are quite small, it can be a blind guess to pick the correct height. But we can‚Äôt have everything, right? Otherwise, a perfect choice for a versatile person!"
I've gotten SO many compliments on these-I absolutely love them. Thank you!
Super belles :) üòä
"I was so skeptical to order at first since it had very few reviews but OMG. It‚Äôs GORGEOUS. Honestly, the pictures online don‚Äôt do it justice. It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. The shipping was incredibly fast, even faster than some places here in the states. It‚Äôs the perfect size, it‚Äôs dainty, it‚Äôs GORGEOUS!! Love, love, love!!! Worth every penny. I am SO pleased and happy! I tried to take as many pictures as I could for the review but, again, pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! üòç thank you so much!!! Wish I could leave more pictures!!!"

Arrived beautifully wrapped and very quickly. I've been wearing it ever since I opened the parcel! It's absolutely beautiful. Many thanks!
the ring is so beautiful! it's exactly what I wanted!! thank you so much :)
Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
Beautiful earrings! I got many compliments.
"I asked a few questions and the shop owner helped me very very quickly, I'm in love with my new stone earrings! the are extremely well done!"
"This review is mainly regarding the seller: The item took a long time to arrive to Canada, but the seller has recently changed to a new shipping company which I imagine should help. Despite the item taking a long time, I believe that Canada Post was mostly at fault and it was lost in their facilities for a while. The seller was responsive and issued a refund before Canada Post finally delivered my item. I appreciate her customer service and I paid her back for the refund. Which she then refunded the difference so my payment ended up being the same as my original discounted price. Item review: My wife seems to really love it and it was well packaged."

The earrings are super cute! love the style.
This is exactly the type of store you want to deal with! The seller was amazing and communicative throughout the whole process. The earrings were delivered ahead of schedule and were gorgeous! The photos don‚Äôt do them justice. This is a store that I would return to over and over because of their quality and service.
"These earrings are so unique, beautiful and fun all wrapped up ... thank you!"
"I absolutely LOVE these earrings ‚Äî they were exactly what I was looking for, but look even better in-person! The packaging was so lovely, too ‚Äî like a tiny birthday present to myself!"
"I absolutely love these little earrings! I got them for my second and third holes. They're the perfect size, comfortable, and very pretty. I got the opal for my husband's birthstone and the turquoise for mine, I only wish they came in diamond for our daughter's birthstone."
Beautiful stones! Reliable shipping to USA. Thanks so much! :)
These Eilat stones are so stunning! I love the color and the fact that are legitimate stones which came straight from Israel. Thanks again!

"This is DEFINITELY the BEST purchase I‚Äôve EVER made on Etsy. I can‚Äôt believe this is actually hand-made! The detail on it, it‚Äôs incredible! Finally- I have a ring that I can wear all the time without the worry of it turning my finger green! I‚Äôm surprised it was done so quickly, too! It came all the way from France to California, & it got her a lot faster than I thought, also! Mew has been my favorite ever since I was a little girl, ever since I can remember actually! I use to carry a Mew plushie all over the place when I was 3. I still have that plush as well~! I LOVE how he used her tail for the part that wraps around your finger. That‚Äôs so incredibly artistic. My mom thinks the same thing! The packaging it came in was really cute too. It came in a little pouch, & was very well packaged so nothing would happen to it. Thank you!"
"This ring is worth every penny, its literally a work of art. The photos don't do it justice. It lightweight but sturdy and the detailing is beautiful. And the gem sparkles when I go out in the sun. I will never take this ring off, I'm in love with it. I will 100% buy again from this shop and recommend to everyone I know."

These earrings are gorgeous!! I personalized them to have black crystals with the turquoise stones and they turned out beautifully!
"I wore these at my wedding, and they received so many compliments!"
Gorgeous earrings that look stunning in person. I like the double backing to help keep the earrings secure.
Ear jackets are very beautiful. Seller was wonderful. Will definitely buy again ‚ô•Ô∏è
I love it. Exactly as described. I like that it's big enough to be noticeable :) Totally worth the wait!
Absolutely Outstanding Ring. Even more beautiful than shown. Excellent Seller. Thank You So Much!!
Very beautiful! I love it. With charming packaging. Quick service.

Beautiful work!!! Beautiful packaging. Really unique and well made. Gorgeous!!! Thank you I will be back for more!
"Top quality silver jewelry for superb prices, excellent service, wonderful seller, thank you! Our daughter loves her earrings :)"
These earrings are so pretty!
These are awesome. Love them. Thank you
"I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them."
I love these earrings!! I wear them almost everyday. This was my first purchase on etsy and I cannot be more satisfied. Thanks Arajera!!
"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
"I really liked my earrings. They're a bit bigger on me than on the model, but I do have small ears. They also arrived a bit on the late side, but I did order them during the holidays, and the shop owner was very attentive about the situation, so I'm still giving a five star review. Very pretty! And sturdy!"
"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my purchases! If you order, be prepared regarding the shipping. It probably could have been delivered faster via Pony Express (‚Äúshipped‚Äù on Feb 4 from NY & arrived Feb 27 in Louisiana with USPS First-Class PKG). BUT the wait was well worth it! I promise. I love the items, I‚Äôll do it again and again!"
"Cuffs made for ears larger than mine; listing missing a picture of the back of the climber. Gold fill isn't easily bendable (which could be great if the items fit), so I couldn't bend the cuffs tight enough to stay - lost one right away, found another after searching. Wire ends are bit sharp. As for the climber, the back wire isn't straight like other items I noticed in the shop; the bend was so sharp my ear ached; also, the sharp point sticking out got caught on everything and ripped the climber off. I've tried bending it straight and tightening at the base. Perhaps it will stay better now. I love the idea of climbers but they will only work for you as daily earrings if the curves and recesses of your outer ear hide wire ends away. The design might be more stable & versatile if back wire were also flattened."
"Thank you for such informative feedback! I am always exited to get review from experienced jewelry designer. My jewelry designed to fit most of my customers, but I understand there might be exceptions. If the cuffs are too big, I can easily exchange the item to one which will fit you perfect. Wire ends are filed and smooth. It might feel sharp if you did not put it on correctly. Wire ends should be on the front of your ear and don't come in touch with your ear. I never recommend redesign my item to achieve better fit. The simplest way to get perfect item is contacting me and, believe me, I will take care of you. I contacted this customer to offer my help with the issue, my messages were totally ignored."
"Mooi! Zit goed, ziet er uit zoals op de foto"
"The earings are amazing :) So airy and elegant :) These earings may turn an ordinary image to the atmospheric one :) Earings fit the ears very naturally. The quality is excelent. The delivery have arrived at time. Thank you so much, Benitta :)))))) Your creations are admirable :)))))) Happily thanks from Istanbul :)))))"
"These came super fast & looked exactly like the picture. My sister loves arrows & she LOVED the earrings. They are dainty, unique & look gorgeous on her. Thanks so much!!"
"Luv all the jewelry. I have purchased from Vermeil Supplies. Very good quality, all as advertised, very quick to ship!! Will definitely be Check their site first when wanting to buy jewelry"
"It looks like very pretty, and the silver makes it look high quality. It looks fairly simple to put on, which is good."
Super cute!!
After searching high and low for this style of ear rings I finally found them . They are absolutely gorgeous understated style .
I am obsessed with these and they are beautiful. I just want to commend the seller on her great customer service as I had an issue with a different earring and she was quick to send me a new one. Looking forward to making more purchases from her.
"I LOVE !!! Beautiful earrings. resolutely modern . A highlight : the comfort ! I do not like to take off my earrings to sleep. With them no problem, you can sleep with . The ring is almost delicate fine and can be worn alone, it fits any fingers. Very good contact with the seller who is very attentive , kind and spontaneous . A great pleasure. Thank you so much !"
These are really cool and different earrings! I wish they could be made to sit a little closer to my lobes.... there are 3 different settings which probably works for most ears. My lower piercings are all stretched out from my cousins tearing at them when they were babies and toddlers so there is more space than I want. They are really cool though!
"This is my second pair of these rose gold earring jackets. I love them so much, I wanted a backup pair in case I lose one. The color is absolutely beautiful. They are a sleek, elegant design, and very high quality craftsmanship. Perfect for a variety of styles and purposes. Packaging is lovely, and shipping was really fast from UK. A wonderful purchase!!"
"I adore these earrings. This particular design convinced me to try again with earrings jackets. A bit of practice, and I love them! They are so sophisticated and minimal, and I love the rose gold. The craftsmanship is very high calibre. Service is great, and delivery from UK was amazingly swift in these times. Am purchasing another pair!"
The earring is beautiful. I love the design and color. One thing which really surprised me was actually how light weight this earring is and how small. It really feels like you‚Äôre just wearing studs which is great.
Love these! Exactly as pictured and arrived promptly. Love them in sterling silver!!
"Very elegant and timeless! üïä These beautiful olive branch earrings are one of my most favorite earrings now, they look and feel so regal! The ornate and classical foliage design reminds me of ancient laurel leaves. I prefer wearing them as pictured, although they are stunning as ear climbers. Many thanks, Joanna!"
"I purchased the bright silver olive leaf ear climbers for my 12-year-old daughter and they are gorgeous. Very delicate and appropriate for a girl, and a nice alternative for someone who doesn't wear big dangly earrings. They are a little trickier to get in than posts but she was able to do it herself without too much trouble."
These climbers are perfect! I have been wearing them everyday since I received them and they look and feel amazing!
"So cute! I love the level of detail, they look great. Thanks so much!"
Great value for the money
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
This product is beautiful in real life and so cute. These were a Christmas gift for my mom and she loves that she can sometimes only wear one backing or she puts the backing with other earrings. It's a winner for sure. Will be buying from them again. Plus shipping was mad fast!
"Full discloser: I haven't worn them yet, so I don't feel that I can give a 5 star rating at this time. It hasn't quite been a month since I got my ears pierced. Just a bit longer and then they can be shown off! I feel fierce, Art Deco-esque vibes just looking at them. I love that these are lightweight earrings. They won't contribute to sagging earlobes later. The design is unique. Nina is very friendly, professional and helpful."
Me encantan! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ Los otros en la foto son de Ohana tambi√©n. I love them! The other ones in the photo are by Ohana too. I thought they were lost in transit because it went weeks without updating after leaving Spain but they arrived a day after the latest expected date. Beatriz was very nice; she told if they didn't arrive by the expected day she would've contacted the delivering company to see where it was. Definitely going to be buying more from them! The wait was worth it. I live in New York. It took a little bit over a month to get here.
Obsessed!!!
"Segunda compra con Ohana. Estos pendientes me chiflan. Son una belleza. Han atra√≠do muchas miradas en mi entorno üòÖ Para mi son unos pendientes 2 en 1 porque puedes ponerte solo la estrella superior como si fuera un brillantito o ""stud"". Envio rapid√≠simo y cuidada presentaci√≥n. Gracias a la tienda por atender mi solicitud de minimizar el uso de pl√°stico desechable en mi paquete."
These are stunning! They came in a great little box and see gorgeous in person. I highly suggest for anyone looking to give great quality earrings at a great price! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Exquisite earrings,thank you so much. Panagiotis is a great person to do bussiness with, he made my earrings as requested! Top seller! I'm looking forward for another purchase. Highly recomented shop!"
Very creative... ƒ∞ like it very much..
Very cute! I love them! Took a long time to ship.
"Great, very pleased with these earrings."
Juste parfaites!
"This is the second ring I asked to be made for me, I contacted Valentini to see if there was a purple colour available & if she could make this ring slightly differently to add a variation to the one that I already have. She responded to my questions promptly & kept me updated with the making of the ring, also sent me a photo of some of the purple colours that she had available for me to choose from. I honestly cannot recommend this seller & shop enough, such quality items with a very fast dispatch & very well packaged in a pretty yet sturdy way as to not get damaged in transit. If you have any questions just go ahead & ask you will definitely not be disappointed with this seller or any of the products she makes. A+++"
So happy with these....like elegant fried eggs (a compliment I assume you). Every piece of jewellery I have bought to date from Greek vendors on Etsy have been so well made and a cut above the rest.
These are a high quality beautiful earrings! Fast shipping. My wife loved them! Thanks enamelove!
"I absolutely love Virginia's designs - they are simple, elegant, striking, and unique all at once. I purchased several pairs of earrings because I just couldn't pick a favorite. I cannot wear any of them without getting compliments. I'm sure I'll treat myself with more her beautiful pieces in the future and will recommend this shop to anyone who asks in the meantime. Thanks so much!"
Simply.Adorable.Period. Only piece of jewelry I have ever gotten compliments on.
"This has become my favorite place to get ""real"" jewelry. Amazing design (I can't find anything else like it) and quality product (stands up to daily wear). I now (happily) own @ 20 pieces of Virginia Wynne's work."
"I absolutely adore these earrings! They are so unique, what a clever idea. I have not been disappointed by anything I have purchased from VirginiaWynne. I intend to make more purchases from this site in the future."
"These are absolutely beautiful! I got the rose quartz ear climbers and they arrived in 2 weeks. For international shipping, I though that was great. I bought them for my wedding but I'm wearing them everyday now!"
These came exactly as pictured. They are so cute and I‚Äôve received lots of compliments. Fast delivery!
I love them! They are gorgeous!
Beautiful! Lovely earrings and really good communication. I‚Äôll be back for more soon! Thanks x
Discr√®tes et adorables. Je vais pouvoir les pr√™ter √† ma fille !
Achet√©es pour ma fille. Parfaites pour les premi√®res boucles pendantes d'une petite princesse !
Exactly as the foto. I love them!!
"J'ai re√ßu des papillons roses au lieu des transparents, que je trouve tr√®s ""cheap"". Mais ma fille les adore... Le malheur des uns fait le bonheur des autres..."
"ORIGINAL , LEGER ET FACILE A PORTER"
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles. Merci beaucoup!
"Longueur parfaite, belles mati√®res, brillantes, color√©es üíñ"
"I have been playing so much mario lately and links awakening so i wanted to get some cute chain chomps of my own!! so i did, these are great! in love thank you"
So awesome. Great craftsmanship. Was afraid links would be weak they are some of the BEST quality I have seen. All the earring is perfect and amazing and matches my jewelry theme. Love this thank you so much. Shipping was less than 3 weeks maybe 2 and a day due to covid19. Not sellers fault at all. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
"This is DEFINITELY the BEST purchase I‚Äôve EVER made on Etsy. I can‚Äôt believe this is actually hand-made! The detail on it, it‚Äôs incredible! Finally- I have a ring that I can wear all the time without the worry of it turning my finger green! I‚Äôm surprised it was done so quickly, too! It came all the way from France to California, & it got her a lot faster than I thought, also! Mew has been my favorite ever since I was a little girl, ever since I can remember actually! I use to carry a Mew plushie all over the place when I was 3. I still have that plush as well~! I LOVE how he used her tail for the part that wraps around your finger. That‚Äôs so incredibly artistic. My mom thinks the same thing! The packaging it came in was really cute too. It came in a little pouch, & was very well packaged so nothing would happen to it. Thank you!"
"This ring is worth every penny, its literally a work of art. The photos don't do it justice. It lightweight but sturdy and the detailing is beautiful. And the gem sparkles when I go out in the sun. I will never take this ring off, I'm in love with it. I will 100% buy again from this shop and recommend to everyone I know."
"Just as pictured. The blue chalcedony is absolutely lovely with the 22k plating. So comfortable! If you're ordering from the U.S., be patient... I think they took a while to clear customs. Shipping was 19 days from notification. Then again, Kazikstan is very far from Boston!"
This came out exactly the way I wanted it. It's really cute & she even custom made me s matching stud for the other ear. Would definitely purchase from her again.
"Wow, just received these beautiful earrings in the mail. I'm obsessed! They are so comfortable and elegant, and so pretty and unique. I have worn them twice and have gotten so many compliments!"
These earrings have a very pretty and unique Look. The texture of the Gold Part is very special and in combination with the pearl makes the earrings very chique!
These are beautiful and a very good quality! Definitely recommend!
Such incredible quality and I get so many compliments!
I love it! The article is perfectly described and it is robust. I received it in a few days. Thank you Layla!
Necklace beautiful and very well made. Very happy ! Thank you
"Well received too, it's beautiful. Thanks!"
Very nice bracelet! Thank you.
"Very good, you can also adjust where the piercing goes in so this was handy as I've got fairly big ears"
"Super pretty and arrived quick! I have tiny ears so was a little big for me, but that's every ear cuff I've ever bought so üòÇ"
Excellent service from ordering to delivery. This item was bought as a birthday gift for my ‚Äúdragon girl‚Äù. She loves it and it looks so lovely on her ear. I was looking for a gift that was personal and a bit different. You sent me the perfect gift. Thank you.
"The headband is beautiful, and fits really well, no pinching behind the ears, either, love it, thank you!"
"Earring are well finished and have more movement than I thought they would. Prettier in person than in pics. Artist is clearly talented as earrings polished, meticulous and glow. Fast shipping, too. Packaging is gift ready, both in a box and heavy ‚Äúsuede‚Äù pouch. I highly recommend this seller."
"Sheri fabricated these earrings custom based on my wild requests. She did a Beautiful Job. I could not be more satisfied. The cuffs are gorgeous, and great quality. I get the look of having 5 piercings with just One ear hole! Incredible!"
I got the medium sized hoops and they are perfect for every day wear that is just unique enough. Reading the instructions on how to put them on and off definitely helped. At first I was a bit concerned how I would get them through my ear lobes. I would definitely recommend them. I had some questions about the right size etc. and Sheri was very responsive.
"I purchased a pair in silver, & loved them so much, I just bought the gold! What a wonderful, chic way to experiment with multiple piercings without the commitment! Stays comfortably on my ear, & I‚Äôve received so many compliments! ü•∞"
"These earrings are incredibly beautiful! Even better than pictured, could not be happier. Love how dainty the metal is and how much the gems sparkle. Earrings shipped quickly and arrived without any damage. Will surely be ordering from this seller again."
"This is my second purchase of these earrings. The first pair was for a friend's birthday, but I loved them so much I ordered a pair for myself. I love how they look on. Have gotten so many compliments on them. Definitely will order from this shop again. Fast shipping and cutely wrapped."
I absolutely love these earrings! I will definitely be buying more.
Love love love these earrings! They are the perfect little accent :)
so beautiful im in love with both pairs of ear climbers. thank u so much I will be ordering from here again! thank u for dealing with me and my crazy ü§™a**..lol
These are beautiful! I get lots of compliments. They are so comfortable in your ears. They look gorgeous up or down. Iwill be buying more from this shop.
"These ear climbers are perfect. They do have a little weight to them. If they slip, follow the instructions given on how to secure them on your ear lobes. They are so beautiful, I wear them all the time! Shipping was fast and secure. Will order from this shop again."
Loved it!!
"These are gorgeous! The seller was very helpful and moved the position of the post for me. Shipping was very fast, and these came beautifully packaged in a jewelry box inside a velvet bag. Super happy with my purchases from this seller!"
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!
"Not only was this as beautiful as in the picture, it came so quickly. I ordered to the US and explained I needed it in time for my husband's birthday. It came right on time and he adored them as he's a huge fan of pin wheels."
Beautifully made! Get many compliments.
"These are absolutely amazing, so fabulous!"
these are lovely. they arrived the day after Christmas.
"These earrings were noticed immediately by my coworkers, they really stand out and I love that, they are so well made, I think its the texture that makes the difference. I will be wearing them a lot, for the extra attention (ha ha)"
This shops delivered to me a lot of wonderful items. Every item is beautiful and made with a lot of love. There is also a wonderful communication with this shop for special instructions. I think it was not my last order. The items are realy great. Thanks a lot
"Beautifully designed earrings, as pictured, and quickly delivered."
Very nice product and the delivery was fast enough. Thank you!!
"These are great! They are very similar to another pair I ordered from sweetiepips, but I couldn't decide! I am happy that they were priced affordably... I didn't have to choose, I just bought both! I love the unique look of the jacket versus the traditional dangle. And the gold and yellow colors of this season are filling my closet!"
Buy from this seller! Earrings are adorable. Shipped very fast! This seller is very honest. A pleasure to do business with this artist!
"The pack they came in was so cute and the earrings themselves are very beautiful. They have a 60's-70's flare to them, love it! Thank you so much !"
These are such a treat--I absolutely love them. They arrived quickly and are so so precious. The Best.
"After purchasing ear crawlers with my constellation, I thought it was very fitting to get another set with my stone. These are very well made, they feel safe, and they look as pretty on as it is shown in the photo. Delivery was excellent, as scheduled. Many thanks."
My favorite. These earrings look so cool in your ear. They fit really comfortably. Probably the most comfortable ear crawlers I own. They are very well made and I love the design.
I¬¥m very happy with my purchase. They aren¬¥t heavy. The earrings are very comfortable. They have become my favorites
"These are awesome! They look amazing, fit great and arrived pretty darn fast üòä"
"Lovely item, beAutufully packaged and done with recycled products which I really liked! delivery was fast, not given to recipient yet but I‚Äôm sure she will live them."
"Lovely little ear climbers, arrived really quickly!"
"Another winner, thank you. Much admired."
I love these earrings. Very pretty and stylish.
Merci beaucoup . Envoie tr√®s rapide. Je n'ai re√ßu que des compliments.
"L√©g√®res et bien finies, je suis tr√®s contente."
"Pour un cadeau, boucles appr√©ci√©es"
"Merci beaucoup de mes les avoir envoy√©s √† nouveau, les articles sont superbes ! Je ne suis pas d√©√ßue du tout. Un tr√®s grand merci √† vous."
Absolutely gorgeous. Easy to put in and super shiny.
Super fast shipping and super cute!!!
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
A beautiful and really unusual pair of ear climbers in black diamond. They‚Äôre so delicate it‚Äôs clear to see the skill that went into making them. Bought for my sister‚Äôs 30th birthday and she loves them. Would definitely buy again.
Such beautiful craftsmanship- I get compliments alllll the time when I wear them. Contact with the shop owner was great as well!!! Thank you!
Such gorgeous earrings - my daughter is thrilled!
It‚Äôs different and I love that can‚Äôt wait to actually go somewhere and wear them.
Adorables boutons. Re√ßus rapidement dans un emballage soign√©.
"parfait, comme d'habitude, tr√®s jolies cr√©ations. Si un jour vous voulez faire un bouton renard, je tiens √† votre disposition une ou deux belles photos de la renarde qui nous honore de ses visites"
"vraiment, vraiment tr√®s mignons, ces boutons"
produit de bon qualit√© originale envoie rapide je recommande et merci pour la petite attention
"I was so afraid to order this pendant because I saw another one of these at another shop that when calculated out was approximately 1/16 (pinhead size)."" I was looking for a small pendant with turquoise but not that small. I found LaineBenthallDesigns and thought I'd give it a try. I received my pendant yesterday and it is SO BEAUTIFUL, JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND THE COLOR IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. It nestles right at the hollow of my neck just above two other necklaces. They don't compete with each other and I've already received complements. Oh, and I forgot to mention the quick delivery. Laine, THANK YOU, so very much for this piece. The only time I will remove it is to clean it!"
"I absolutely love this ring. Beautiful heavy, thick sterling ring. I actually call it a family ring, with my birthstone first, then my 3 children's birthstones and then my grandchildren birthstones, as they came along in my life. Handmade and beautifully done. Thank you so much, Laine, I worship this üíç"
"I paired this with a Catbird NYC Sweet Nothing chain. It's the perfect mix of sparkle and understated. The size of the moonstone is small, which is exactly what I wanted. I'm in love with it; might buy an emerald one, too!"
"I think these earrings are now the prettiest thing I own. I love them so much. Super fast delivery, too. Thank you so much, Laine!"
bought two pair . One in rose one in silver . Love them
Great earrings!
Love them . Thank you
Received and LOVE! Fast shipping A+ Thanks!
Absolutely love these earrings! Beautiful!
"Heavy and sturdy. Beautifully crafted, as is everything from this shop. Those earvine posts are not going anywhere."
"Beautiful! Arrived promptly, and well-packed (it's fragile)!"
these are so awesome thank you
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©"
"I ADORE the white topaz ear pins! I bought a pair instead of just the one. I wore them out to dinner last night and I was stopped by several people and asked about them. I have my ears pierced 15 times, so ear cuffs and crawlers dont really work for me. I will definitely be ordering some more similar items from this shop. Beautiful!"
"I bought one for my left as I have longer hair over my right ear. I like funky unusual earrings and this fits the bill. I love it. I just can't wait for lockdown to be lifted so I can show it off. Everything went well, with swift delivery. I look forward to finding some delightful jewellery off you in the near future, thank you xx"
my fav. earrings! thank you!!
Awesome product and looks exactly like pictures. Will order from them again!
Super cute and exactly what I wanted
Very beautiful earrings. They arrived before the expected shipping day and everything was as described. Thank you
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."
Je suis ravie ! La commande a √©t√© exp√©di√©e en 24h et est arriv√©e en environ 15 jours. Les boucles d‚Äôoreilles sont parfaitement conformes √† la description et correspondent tout √† fait √† ce que je souhaitais ! Je vais d√®s √† pr√©sent ajouter d‚Äôautres articles dans ma wishlist pour une future commande !
"Lovely earrings! They are delicate, very elegant and so original, though a bit smaller than expected. They come in their own little box. I get hundreds of compliments when wearing them!"
WELL worth the wait through customs honestly! quality is great and they're so cute! i know i'll get a lot of wear out of them
These are adorable I put them in my third hole and they look so good with my other earrings. They were shipped out quickly and I receive them within days. I was even sent a 10% off coupon by them.
"This ring is perfect! The only issue I had was trying to adjust the band to be smaller, but once I got that figured out, I barely took it off. This is an awesome purchase!"
Amazing quality and such a gorgeous ring. I have gotten so many compliments. Definitely will be purchasing jewelry here again ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è and excuse the nails lol
The delay in delivery was definitely worth the wait! The ring is gorgeous and I love it. Very good quality.
"I absolutely love these! They are a little bit more tiny than I expected but that‚Äôs okay, I love them just the way they are! They are real silver, I did a couple of at home tests to confirm it and I have extremely sensitive skin, so if they weren‚Äôt real silver I couldn‚Äôt wear them for long periods of them. I have been wearing them for a little over 48 hours and my ears are fine! I highly recommend those, they are super cute, great quality and got here (Canada) very quickly! ü•∞ü¶ïü¶ñ"
"At first I was disappointed, I bought this to wear as an anklet but it‚Äôs a little bit too small. I added some of my own extra chain and it‚Äôs PERFECT!! Seriously the cutest evil eye anklet everüßø"
The ring is perfect! I initially ordered a size 7 and it was a bit too big and asked for an exchange and received a size 6 which fits perfectly. Love it!
"Love love LOVE these earrings! They are were absolutely perfect in size for the five year old I gifted them to. Her eyes lit up when she opened the box, and all afternoon, she squealed, ""I got unicorn earrings!"" Great quality, adorable design."
"I had two loose stones that I wanted to have a custom setting made for, and Arpit went above and beyond to make the ring of my dreams with my stones! I sent him a rough sketch of what I wanted the ring to look like, along with some photos of rings with the style of bands/settings that I wanted, and he did a phenomenal job of bringing my idea to life! I appreciated that he sent me photos of the finished ring before shipping it to make sure everything was perfect, and he was happy to make a couple very minor changes that I requested. I am so happy with how my ring turned out, and I will definitely be coming back to Arpit for any custom jewelry requests I have in the future!"
"The ring is beautiful, and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ordered off Etsy so I was apprehensive. I had it appraised and it was properly priced. It took longer than I anticipated, but I love it!"
"This ring definitely beautiful ring ever I bought, it's unique and you probably won't find it anywhere else. I have not proposed my girlfriend. Wish me luck! It worth the wait."
"I got this ring for my nieces birthday, and she loves it! -side note, it was a bit more dainty then I expected, my own negligence on that part.- She‚Äôs 14, so it‚Äôs her first special and real piece of jewelry, all in all it‚Äôs lovely and I couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more!"
"I love these earrings and I get compliments on them all the time. They are well-made, high-quality and fast shipping. Well worth the money!"
"Very quick shipping; especially in corona-times. Nice packaging, even including a little ""extra"". Quality item, quite original and very comfortable to wear. Has gotten lots of compliments on the earrings."
Beautiful earrings! I will be purchasing more!
"Looks just like on photo, beautiful and very well maid, my gf liked it very much."
"Very elegant Earrings, exactly as pictured. Truly something else. Im very happy with them. Gonna probably order some for my friend as well, since she likes them a lot too. Thank you also for fast shipping and very good wrapping."
love it ! very fashionable !
"I would wear this pair of earrings all the time, all day long if it were solid gold. Got compliments all the time, very well made. Beautiful item! I love it! Received much earlier than promised - in short, highly recommend this seller. No worries, you will be happy with your purchase. I will definitely buy again from this seller."
"These earrings are gorgeous, got compliments immediately. Very well made, love the texture of the finish. And great customer service from Peris, the first pair got lost in the mail so he very kindly sent another pair!"
Amazingly beautiful earrings! And Zvia at Gazelle Jewelry is so sweet and kind. She gave me top class service and delivered these earrings from Tel Aviv to Sweden in just 3 days since I was in a hurry to get them for my wedding. I am so happy with my purchase from Gazelle Jewelry and will definitely buy from her shop again. Recommends this shop so much!!
"This headband was beautiful. I loved it for my wedding. It was not too small or too big, just perfect. Thank you so much!"
"This was absolutely stunning. Fantastic quality, got many compliments at my sister's wedding."
"This is a beautiful piece. Well constructed. No chipping or cracks on the band, which is a bit smaller than expected, but I have a small head, so it fits really delicately & beautifully. Arrived well packaged in an adorably wrapped gift box, & even included a surprise little ""bonus"" gift. :) My only complaint, and why I'm not giving a full 5 star review is: The crafted flower I received did Not match the one in the photo in design or color. While I still received a very well made and lovely piece, I'm a bit disappointed, as I am using this as part of my wedding, and had specifically chosen it to match other pieces I'll be wearing. I can still work with the piece I got, but it is not 100% the one I ordered from the shown picture. I still highly recommend this shop & items. They are beautifully made and a quality piece of art"
‚ù§Ô∏è Love them! Thanks so much!
"Arrived today, and it looks great! It's my first ""minimal"" design earring and they fit nicely. Merci beaucoup ;)"
as always from this shop. good quality and fair prices. will be back ;)
"Really love my earrings, nice heavy quality, comfortable to leave in all the time."
"The pieces I ordered were absolutely beautiful and you could tell Marina spent much time and effort in making quality products. I love them and would definitely purchase again. Even better was Marina's customer service, which is one of the best I've experienced. She's not only prompt in answering messages, but works with you if you have special needs or requests, going above and beyond to make sure you're satisfied. Thanks again Marina, I'd give you even more stars if I could!"
"Sehr sch√∂ne und massive Ohrstecker. Das minimalistische Design ist toll und ich wurde schon ein paar mal auf diese Ohrringe angesprochen. Die Stecker sind gut und sauber gearbeitet, ein wenig umst√§ndlich anzuziehen (erst das Querst√ºck, dann hinter dem Ohrl√§ppchen das senkrechte Teil und dann den ""Stopfen""). Es sind keine Ohrringe, die man mal √ºber Nacht anlassen kann, da sie schon recht massiv sind. Alles in allem finde ich sie sehr sch√∂n und kann sie nur weiter empfehlen. Sie kamen in einer sehr sch√∂nen Verpackung mit einem pers√∂nlichen Gru√ü der Verk√§uferin an. Der Versand war auch okay, daf√ºr dass sie aus Griechenland kamen!"
"Fabulous design. Simple, yet edgy, and beautifully made. They look great with my new short haircut. Lovely correspondence with Marina, and received quickly from overseas. Thank you!"
So beautiful! I get a million compliments every time I wear these. Such a lovely seller as well-super communicative and just a delight.
"I love this simple ear climber. It‚Äôs my first and I had no idea if I‚Äôd even like them. It‚Äôs simple, delicate, and a subtle different and exciting piece of jewelry to switch things up. Also, gold filled is the best option! And, the small details when I received my package was such a pleasant surprise. This is why I love shopping local!"
"Wow, this is my first pair of climbers and I love them!! They are so dainty and beautiful while being ever so slightly edgy. They're also very comfortable - I squeeze them tighter once on and have been able to wear them without the back and even sleep in them. I cannot say enough kind things about the seller - it took a few days longer than anticipated seemingly due to customs and in the in-between time when we thought they might have gotten lost in the mail, she generously offered to send me a refund or a new order right away! I couldn't believe how generous she was to do that. Thanks for this beautiful product and incredible customer service!!"
"Bonjour, Merci pour votre email mais je n'ai pas encore re√ßu cet article. Pourriez-vous faire le n√©cessaire? En vous remerciant par avance, je vous adresse mes meilleurs messages. Giuliana Toscano"
Love the look of it.
"I am so pleased with this ear cuff, it looks really lovely and the quality is great!! Lulu made me a slightly larger sized cuff (maybe I have funny shaped ears ü§£) as the standard size was a bit on the small side for me. It was absolutely no trouble to get it exchanged and the new one was with me in super quick time. I would definitely buy from Lulu again and recommend this item as it‚Äôs gorgeous!! X"
I bought these beautiful earrings for a best friend and she LOVES them. Beautifully simple and well made with lovely materials. Lovely packaging and fast post too. Thank you Lulu! :)
"Absolutely love these earrings, so cool and beautifully finished. Lulu has done it again. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I LOVE these earrings so much! Surprise gift from my husband, but then I did leave them on the pc screen as a massive hint lol! Beautiful design, so different. Very well made. Love them. Thank you X"
"Such beautiful earrings!! It's very unique, beautiful, but not too over the top. I've been coming back to Dana after my wedding for the past two years because her jewelry and professionalism compare to no other! I highly recommend this shop!"
These were absolutely perfect in my wedding day. They were well made and shipped quickly. I couldn‚Äôt be happier!
Purchased these for my wedding and am very happy! I love the simple elegance. Fits perfectly with my taste and beautiful quality.
"Beautiful earrings, unique and clear design, exactly as the pictures. Thank you,Dana! üòä I highly recommend this shop!"
Lovely earrings and excellent customer service! Highly recommend!
So beautiful! Beautifully packaged too! Given as a gift to a very happy recipient! Thanks again for making gift buying to easy!!
Sweet little line of stars . Thank you.
Love them just what I was looking for
"I adore these earrings! I bought a different pair from someone else where the part that went through your ear was shaped like a paperclip - very rounded and curved. The part that showed on the earlobe was a straight line. This earring has more of a ""square"" shape that goes through your ear (with slight corners) which allows more room for the lobe and it feels so much more comfortable. In addition, the slight curve of the part that sits on your earlobe is a lot more flattering, I think, than the straight ones from the other seller. This is a terrific earring! I'm going to get the silver as well. These stay put, too. The seller packaged the items nicely and they shipped quickly. Very happy!"
I love my earring! I had one similar to this one and lost it. So glad I was able to find another. This one is much more comfortable than the one I had before from a different seller. This one I can‚Äôt even tell its there it is some light and comfortable!
I have my own jewelry line but when I saw this I fell in love immediately! Now that I have it in my ear I know this will be an item I wear ALOT! So in love with it and will back to buy more! Thanks!
"The gold is very light and almost similar to the silver version of this earring, but still beautifully made. I love having one pair in each color so that I can coordinate with the rest of my jewelry. Fast shipping as well. Thank you!"
"Super sch√∂ne Ohrstecker, schnelle Lieferung und ein total netter Kontakt. Vielen lieben Dank daf√ºr"
"Wow. I have bought silver hoops before, but these blow them all away. They are SO well-crafted and beautiful! Not too heavy for my delicate earlobes and totally hypoallergenic! The clasp is one of the best--it snaps right in place, without wobbling around and clicks right into it's matching latching hole (I purchased some white gold hoops that didn't have such craftsmanship). These are my new favorite earrings. They look beautiful and I love the cubic zirconia ornamentation that's perfectly delicate. The earrings were so well packaged and included a silver-polishing cloth. I'm in Chicago and it took a good while to get them from Germany during the pandemic, but they were worth every second of the wait. The seller is extremely kind and accommodating--she takes obvious pride in her craft. Will buy from her again!"
Als ich diese Ohrringe sah war es Liebe auf den ersten Blick <3 Ich liebe Fr√∂sche und deswegen mussten diese putzigen Racker bei mir einziehen. Sie sind sehr sch√∂n gearbeitet und sehen sehr hochwertig aus. Der Versand ging super schnell und der Kontakt war unglaublich toll mit der lieben Anja. Danke daf√ºr! <3
"I have a confession to make. I bought this ring for myself. And yes it did take time getting to me. But I freaking love this ring. It is so cute. It fits on my ring finger, and is durable. Important thing in the life of a barista."
"These are even prettier in person! I rarely see RQ merchandise, let alone jewelry, so I knew I had to snag one of these for sure when I saw Victoria Aveyard herself post it. I love the earrings!"
"I apsolutely adore them! Beautifly packed, gorgeously done. I am so happy to have them. Wonderful work and I strongly reccomend them!"
All I can say is this: Perfection.
"The seller was very commutative and created a beautiful piece of jewelry. For anyone who is a fan of the red queen series, this piece is perfect!"
"The earrings are stunning, high quality, and look exactly like the picture. The customer service is great too, 10/10 definitely recommend!"
"I am so in love with these earrings! Everything about this purchase was amazing. These are my favourite everyday pair, thank you!"
I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit. Only issues are putting them on and taking them off is a challenge because they are very small and have 3 pieces to manage. I've dropped the pieces several times. But that's getting better with practice.
"absolutely beautiful, gladly again!!!"
The earrings are beautiful! I wear them every day. I‚Äôm so happy with this purchase!
Love these earrings! Worn them every day since receipt.
"I LOVE these earrings! They are so beautifully oxidized and just the perfect size. They‚Äôre very easy to wear and very, very comfortable too! The craftsmanship is outstanding! I really do LOVE the way they look! They came very securely packaged with fast delivery, especially considering they first had to be made and then shipped to the United States. I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase. Thank you so very, very much. üíúü•∞üíú"
These earrings are absolutely beautiful. They are high quality and exactly what I wanted. They arrived quicker than I expected. I highly recommend this artist.
"They look lovely, exactly t as I was looking for! Thin and seems to be fragile earrings, very delicate look. Easy to adjust the hook so they fit better."
"My daughter loves these. She wears them all the time. So much detail on them, absolutely stunning."
Super contente. Exp√©dition rapide. Produit canon!!!! Merci √† toi üòÉ
"Envoi tr√®s rapide, article au top, merci beaucoup !"
Tr√®s joli boucles d'oreille et C√©cile tr√®s arrangeante pour l'envoi pour que je les ai le jour de mon anniversaire! Merci encore :-)
"Syst√®me de fermeture bien trop succinct, j‚Äôai perdu l‚Äôune d‚Äôentre elles √† peine enfil√©... Cependant l‚Äôenvoie est plus que rapide ! Elles sont tr√®s jolies mais le rapport qualit√© prix √† mon avis est √† revoir."
"Nous vendons ce mod√®le depuis 3 ans, c'est une de nos meilleures ventes et c'est la premi√®re fois qu'on a cette remarque. C'est le m√™me syst√®me de fermeture que toutes les cr√©oles qui passent dans l'oreille. Le rapport qualit√© prix est plus que correct, nous n'avons pas boug√© le prix depuis 3 ans alors que nos prix d'achat et les taxes ne cessent de grimper, notre marge est plus basse que ce qui est conseill√©. Nous allions vous renvoyer une boucle parce que notre premier d√©sir est de satisfaire nos clientes mais votre message priv√© √©tait tr√®s d√©sagr√©able et nous a beaucoup d√©√ßues.

Love it thank u so much dear really love them ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüôèüèª and I love my little pillow with them ü•∞
"I ordered these beautiful earrings on May 6. After I clicked to purchase, I saw that they were coming from Paris, France--I would not have ordered had I know that. I live in the US. I emailed on May 16 and received word that they had not been shipped but would be soon. As of today I have not received them. The email has been shut down. I cannot find a phone number. Etsy states that I have to go through the website. When I do that, the ""Conversation unable to be sent"" I'm very frustated. I will be following up with my credit card to dispute the charges. UPDATE 6/3/19. Etsy intervened and said my charges would be credited back. This afternoon, I received the package from Paris. It was sent mid May. The earrings are truly beautiful. The packaging was great, wrapped very nicely, with a small satchel included."
"Elles sont juste sublimes ! Un peu plus petites que ce que j'imaginais d'apr√®s les photos, mais vraiment tr√®s belles, de tr√®s belle qualit√© (pas cheap du tout, au contraire !). Elles ont un super rendu, j'adore ! Livraison rapide et emballage impeccable, elles √©taient bien prot√©g√©es !"
One of my favorite pair of earrings! Love them so much
I exchanged the ear climbers for the beaded chain bar earrings -- I love the earrings! They are lightweight and very comfortable. I wear them all the time; very happy with this purchase.
I just received my ear climber and really love it. It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to put it on (duh) but finally got it and the look is minimal but bold -- just love it.
Love the rose gold color...its my first ear crawler ......like the size n chain....thanks
"love these! already have the climbers in silver, the gold is also beautiful. thank you!"
Belle boucles d'oreilles envois tr√®s soign√©
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
I LOVE these earrings. They are even better than I hoped they would be (and I had high hopes). Will definitely shop here again!
These are absolutely stunning. I feel so elegant! I have tiny ears so the birds cover pretty much the whole bottom half of my ear but I still think it looks great. They are difficult to get in unless you bend the backing to straighten out the angle quite a lot.
"I love these earrings! They are beautiful, and detailed. Everything about them is wonderful! From the packaging to how it fits. There is nothing I would change about it!"
"These are the sweetest earrings and are so comfortable to wear! I love them! I will definitely order from arajera again! The packaging was awesome, in a little bottle! Shop early for the holidays because it did take nearly a month to arrive from the Philippines! ‚ù§"
I love these earrings! They are so simple but elegant and good for everyday wear. They are very comfortable and I can sleep in them withoutbeing poked by a post. Very happy :)
Love these!! They‚Äôre so cute and I get compliments on them all the time ‚ù§Ô∏è
Loved the earrings and they arrived fast!
I love the earrings there so nice and comfortable they came a couple of days ago and I‚Äôve already worn both pairs I bought
I get compliments all the time! Obsessed :)
"Tr√®s jolie boucle d‚Äôoreille, fine et √©l√©gante. Me pla√Æt encore plus qu‚Äôen photo. Envoi soign√© mais d√©lai un peu long ( re√ßue 1 mois jour pour jour apr√®s ma commande ). Bonne communication avec le vendeur."
Je suis ravie de ces boucles d'oreille. L'emballage √©tait soign√©e et l'exp√©dition rapide ! Rien √† reprocher
Love it! Quality was there as well.
I got these to pair along with the little hoops with the same triangular ball arrangement. They look so cute together. These earrings are beautiful!
These are amazing and great quality love that theyres adjustments for the earring would buy from again!!! I literally get so many compliments
"Those earrings/jackets are perfect: dainty but visible, adding charm and a modern finish. the gold plating is light coloured so it goes better with my white skintone. As I am allergic to most alloymetals, I love to get a minimalistic and modern design in sterling silver! Many thanks to lovely Lalia who kept me informed trough the purchase order and is overall there for questions. Best, L."
"I got these earrings a couple of weeks ago and I've been using them non stop. They looks exactly like the picture, and they arrived pretty fast also! They're really perfect with every outfit, elegant or casual. Also, the seller was lovely! I will definitely buy from her again!"
The rose gold color is beautiful and it is very eye-catching and unique. The right earring was a little tight but I think I can bend it a bit and it will be fine. Love that it's comfortable enough to sleep in and doesn't irritate at all. Thanks again!
"Had these earrings for a few months now, and I am in love with them!!! I get compliments constantly. I have an issue wearing any other metal in my ears other than titanium, and I can't find pretty titanium earrings anywhere else. These are perfect! I have them in 24/7 and have no issues. Will definitely be purchasing more!"
Magnifique!
Love the material and design of this item! I've also gotten many compliments on its unique design - it looks and feels high-quality. One thing I wasn't expecting was the thick gauge of the earring. It hurt my ear slightly and it'll take time for my ear to stretch out.
"I'm loving these earrings! Took me a little bit to get the hang of getting them in the way I liked them in the picture but, once I did they look so great!! I like that they were not too flimsy either. Great buy! I might have to get the other shapes too!!"
"With hairdressers being closed, I shaved my head and wanted a statement earring to show off. This earring is super unique, elegantly simple and gets me lots of comments and complements!"
"Love this earring. Got the triangle ear climber to use with the short side of an asymmetric haircut. Took me a few minutes to figure out how to put it on, but once I had it in it was very comfortable, and I have left it in ever since. This is a striking look, and lots of people comment on it."
"Very unique earrings! Takes a few minutes to figure out how to put them in, but easy when you get the hang of it. I get compliments every time!"
"Very nice, lightweight and unique!"
"This is the second ring I asked to be made for me, I contacted Valentini to see if there was a purple colour available & if she could make this ring slightly differently to add a variation to the one that I already have. She responded to my questions promptly & kept me updated with the making of the ring, also sent me a photo of some of the purple colours that she had available for me to choose from. I honestly cannot recommend this seller & shop enough, such quality items with a very fast dispatch & very well packaged in a pretty yet sturdy way as to not get damaged in transit. If you have any questions just go ahead & ask you will definitely not be disappointed with this seller or any of the products she makes. A+++"
These are a high quality beautiful earrings! Fast shipping. My wife loved them! Thanks enamelove!
Beautiful earrings! They are adjustable and can be worn multiple ways. Very clever!
"These are the coolest earrings I have ever owned, in my life. Thank you so much! I really feel I am myself when I have them on. They are very well made, and very delicate. I will cherish them forever with care."
Love these ear rings. They look as good as I was hoping for!

"I only just received these gorgeous earrings today. They are exactly as pictured, and better. They are the perfect size (not too big so they don't look chunky, and not too long that they keep falling). They are also a lovely colour against my olive complexion. I can't wait to wear these out. Thank you Ohana Jewels I must say I am a big fan of your jewellery and will no doubt be ordering from you again. Xx"

"Me encanta todo lo que compr√©. Cati es una gran profesional, hace las joyas con mucho amor y pasi√≥n. Se nota en cada detalle, desde la calidad de las joyas, hasta la delicadeza del empaquetado del envio. Contact√© con ella porqu√© tenia un par de dudas y me las resolvi√≥ en seguida.

I just received these today and they are absolutely stunning! They came with super cute packaging and hand written care instructions. All around 10/10
Super cute and unique earrings. I love how light they are. I have some other earrings of this size and they‚Äôre too heavy to wear comfortably. Shipping took a little while but they were worth the wait. Packaging was performed gift giving... but I‚Äôm keeping them for myself ; )
My new favorite necklace I wear with everything. It fits the classy boho look I was going for and it‚Äôs so light I don‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs there.
"These earrings are true stunners. Before purchasing I worried they‚Äôd be too big on me but they‚Äôre so delicate and feminine that they can afford to be big! Each time I wear them, I‚Äôve had numerous people stop me in public and also on zoom meetings to ask what kind of hair clip/necklace/earrings/‚Äúmagical face mask‚Äù I‚Äôm wearing. They effortlessly elevate my outfits and they somehow also make me feel confident enough to not wear much makeup while wearing them. They were packaged so nicely and included a very sweet and thoughtful handwritten note with a gracious thank you from the seller/artist as well as a couple of tips in caring for these gems (including the little bag she suggested keeping them in). I can not wait to purchase more pieces!"
Love these. Having a great time showing them off to friends too! I love the clean line and subtle twist. I'm not into big showy jewelry. I like a tailored look. And these go I love the clean line and subtle twist. I'm not into big showy jewelry. I like a tailored look. And these go well with every day and casual/dressy evening looks
"I love these earings. I never had a pair like this before, but figured that they would be great because i now have a baby that pulls at everything within reach. They came in a cute box with beautiful ribon and a tiny flower attached to the ribbon. They are made in Greece, so it took a little over a week to get here, but they are well worth the wait."
The seller was wonderful and got them to me all the way from Greece in time for a gift for Christmas...... but I loved them so much I kept them! I now wear them A LOT and get a lot of compliments. Good quality and beautifully packaged on arrival too. Highly recommended x
"I love these ear crawlers and they are gorgeous!!! They are great to wear every day! Arrived fast, considering they are made when you order them. I will be ordering from this shop again. Thank you!"
"I have been playing so much mario lately and links awakening so i wanted to get some cute chain chomps of my own!! so i did, these are great! in love thank you"
So awesome. Great craftsmanship. Was afraid links would be weak they are some of the BEST quality I have seen. All the earring is perfect and amazing and matches my jewelry theme. Love this thank you so much. Shipping was less than 3 weeks maybe 2 and a day due to covid19. Not sellers fault at all. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
"This is DEFINITELY the BEST purchase I‚Äôve EVER made on Etsy. I can‚Äôt believe this is actually hand-made! The detail on it, it‚Äôs incredible! Finally- I have a ring that I can wear all the time without the worry of it turning my finger green! I‚Äôm surprised it was done so quickly, too! It came all the way from France to California, & it got her a lot faster than I thought, also! Mew has been my favorite ever since I was a little girl, ever since I can remember actually! I use to carry a Mew plushie all over the place when I was 3. I still have that plush as well~! I LOVE how he used her tail for the part that wraps around your finger. That‚Äôs so incredibly artistic. My mom thinks the same thing! The packaging it came in was really cute too. It came in a little pouch, & was very well packaged so nothing would happen to it. Thank you!"
"This ring is worth every penny, its literally a work of art. The photos don't do it justice. It lightweight but sturdy and the detailing is beautiful. And the gem sparkles when I go out in the sun. I will never take this ring off, I'm in love with it. I will 100% buy again from this shop and recommend to everyone I know."

Super fast shipping! Looks absolutely gorgeous in person and it holds up well on my ears! Will definitely purchase from here again soon!
They're gorgeous wearing them in the day of my wedding üòç
"Cr√©atrice au top, √† l'√©coute des demandes. tr√®s heureuse de mes 5 achats"
So beautiful!!! - And perfect with the flat disc stoppers!!! ;-)
Thank you! These go with so many things and are very elegant yet unique and stylish.
I love it!!! And thank you for the gift!!
Very pretty and unique earrings. Didn't realize they would be matte silver rather than shiny but love them anyway and goes with other matte silver I own. Thanks for your wonderful design and craftsmanship
"I love the versatility of this earring design. It's easy to picture wearing these as only studs on both ears, with the stud plus earring jacket on both ears, or a stud on one side and a stud plus an earring jacket on the other side. This look is pure fun. ‚ù§Ô∏è! Marilee"
It took a long time to be delivered but it made in the promised time and the wait was totally worth it. They are well made pieces! Very pretty!
Best earrings. This is not the first time I bought earrings from virginiawynne I love the work and each piece is unique.
"Comme les bleues, article tr√®s sympa √©galement, boucles √©toiles que j'appr√©cie vraiment. Merci pour votre s√©rieux et votre rapidit√©. Command√© mercredi soir et re√ßu vendredi matin. Je recommande..."

Yes it shipped on time. Perfect for the pendants want to wear with it. Very happy.
One of the most cutest things!! Love it! I can recommend to the others.
"I accidentally bought only one, but it is so cute! I am ordering an additional one to give a pair to my sister."
"Wow are these gorgeous! I‚Äôm a minimalist and picky about what goes into my closet. I‚Äôve searched for a few years and finally found the perfect piece. They‚Äôre light, well-crafted, extremely stylish. Very happy customer!"
"Received the earrings Monday after ordering late on the Friday. Presentation was beautiful, I almost didn't want to open it. The earrings are gorgeous & surpassed my expectations. Thank you!"
These have become my everyday earrings!
Beautiful
"I purchased these as a gift for my wife, they arrived thoughtfully packaged and are beautifully made. My Wife absolutely adores them, to the point of ordering two different pairs from the same Lady. They are unusual but look really good."
Belle boucles d'oreilles envois tr√®s soign√©
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!
"I would like to let you know how delighted my daughter is with this ring, the quality and craftsmanship is superb. I will be keeping a watch on this shop in the future. Thank you."
These are the perfect jacket for my diamond earrings! I just love them! Glad I made the purchase.
"Received this timely as promised, very cute and perfect for my 9 year old granddaughter's birthday. Got me a pair also!"
A perfect fit - I love them they look so pretty on my ear. Thank you
Gorgeous minimalist organic design. Love them
This set is beautiful!! I got the right ear climber and the left as the standard earring. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!
gorgeous! looks great as a pair (one on each ear) and looks great with the crawler on one ear depending on the hairdo- very very happy with the purchase of both!!!!!!!
"One of the jewel‚Äôs prongs weren‚Äôt closed, so that one got loose and I had to fix it. Definitely love my earrings though!!! They are perfect for my big day."
"These are so cool looking, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!! They are a little on the heavy side so I probably will wear them only for the reception (not the ceremony) but they are going to look SO GOOD with my leather jacket! Just an FYI these are glamorous enough that you probably don‚Äôt need a necklace with them!"
Custom made for a really good price. It's larger than I imagined which isn't a bad thing. I think Moissanite and Diamonds may be cut a little different which makes the Moissanite larger in diameter than a diamond. It's so pretty and it arrived way faster than I expected. I have no doubt my forever ring will last forever. Moissanite is very durable like a diamond. My first ring was a moissanite and looks exactly the same as it did when I bought it five years ago. Don't hesitate to buy from this shop!
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
I am so happy I went with this Etsy seller. I LOVE this ring. Had it checked to verify it is 10k and real moissanite. I can‚Äôt stop looking at it and will DEFINITELY be looking for Mother‚Äôs Day and Christmas! Thank you Harshita for answering my many questions also. I am very particular about stone size and having my rings be similar in thickness and width. Pictured is my new eternity bezel set 1.24 ctw in moissanite next to my 2 ct moissanite solitaire ‚ù§Ô∏è I love love love!!!!!
"I LOVE THESE! They look elegant, simple, they are beautiful and made very well. They came as expected when I ordered them in a pretty box with instructions how to put them on. I recommend 10/10"
Stunning earrings! Very elegant and easy to put on. Will definitely be buying from this shop again! Love!
These earring are beautiful!! I have loved wearing them. They are prefect for wanting a statement earring that doesn‚Äôt get tangled with my face mask.
Gorgeous and easy to use. Fast shipping very happy with my purchase ‚ò∫
These are amazing!! Haha So pretty!!<3 I got them for my sister for Christmas and she's going to love them!! Great service!! <3 :)
My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead- instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.
"It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that‚Äôs to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!"
"It is well made! I was hoping to wear them daily but they are uncomfortable to sleep in. I did also recently get my 2nd and 3rd piercing so that may be why. I have smaller ears so they are big and the flattened edge isn't super visible, in general with their size it is not a very noticeable feature to start. I started putting backs on while I sleep because they were coming out of my 3rd hole and I was nervous they would close up. They did come pretty quick though I was nervous about shipping they shipped fast and very super communicative."
These two are my OTP so when I saw the option to make my own pairing this is what I went for. They are incredibly cute! The matte colors are actually a little brighter than in this picture. They came packaged super safely with extra wrap inside and outside their custom box.
"I've been meaning to leave a review for a while now so here it is: a) it was sent to me in a cute little box, snug and carefully packaged, b) it's exactly like in the picture, and c) they are just adorable! and d) Deadpool would be proud. I get compliments on them at work and they really stand out. I am definitely going to buy here again in the future! :)"
This was my first time requesting something and I was not disappointed. It's Genji from Overwatch and I just love him! :D The seller was quick to respond and showed me how the graphic would look before I planned on buying it. He looks great! :) I might just make another request in the future.
"My item took awhile to arrive but it was so worth the wait! They are brightly colored, thick, & are larger than what I expected. The quality is great & the seller worked with me on my purchase to mix and match Stranger Things items. Now I want to buy her whole shop. üòç These are unique. I have not found anything else like this before so buy your items now, before I buy her whole store! üòù ‚ô•Ô∏èüôåüèª"
Really beautiful. Seller was great to make sure these fit correctly. These are really unique earrings. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of compliments already.
Love! Great quality and super unique. I have gotten compliments on these every where I have worn them.
I'm very happy with my purchase. The earring are well made and have a unique look. I have gotten several compliments already :)
Very nice design and well made earrings! Love them - thanks Madeleine! It's great that Madeleine customizes each pair according to her customers' earlobe piercing measurements.
Lovely earrings and excellent customer service! Highly recommend!
So beautiful! Beautifully packaged too! Given as a gift to a very happy recipient! Thanks again for making gift buying to easy!!
Sweet little line of stars . Thank you.
Love them just what I was looking for

Beautiful product and I received a coupon for my next purchase which was completely unexpected and very appreciated thank you :) <3
"I absolutely love these crawlers!!! I had recently received a set in a subscription box and unfortunately they were plated metal. Turned my ears green/black. I had been looking all over locally without luck for this particular style crawler and then it hit me to check Etsy! Ahhh now I am in love with your jewelry and was so impressed with these crawler that I ended up purchasing 2 other items which have come and they are absolutely perfect. Thank you so much! I certainly can foresee future purchases and have been spreading the word. Thanks again, Sarah T"
"Wow super fast shipping! I ordered these ear pins on a Thursday & got them the following Monday. I like how these ear pins don't look ""crafty"" like most of the listings for ear pins do. These pins look like high quality store sold earrings. Will definitely purchase from this shop again."
Super cute and chic! Super excited to where these out! Love love love them! The color is amazing and they fit so perfectly on my ear it feels like I'm not even wearing anything
I highly recommend Buying from this vender! Shipping was not only fast but my earnings came wrapped in a nice box with a beautiful bag inside! The quality of the earnings was outstanding!
"The earrings are so gorgeous!! Thank you so much, will definitely come back!"
It's incredible! The package arrived unprepared today! It took a month and a half to get it! Really super beautiful! Thank you for seller's help and understanding
Gorgeous vintage designer brooch and earring set in superb condition as described. Looks identical to photos except color of stones is even more impressive in person. Exceptional find by this designer and in this color and condition. Quickly and safely shipped; reasonable price. Thank you!
"These are absolutely beautiful. The pictures don‚Äôt show the actual beauty. They‚Äôre so delicate and beautifully made. Ty so much, I‚Äôll most likely purchase more from this shop."
Super!exactement comme sur la photo envoi rapide et soign√©!Merci beaucoup!
"Parfait. Elles ont fait leur petit effet sous le sapin de No√´l. Merci ! Le colis est arriv√© le 24, parfait ! üëåüòä"
"J'adore ! Super l√©g√®res et tr√®s brillantes, c'est vraiment ce que je voulais ! Je recommande üëåüëå"
"I only ordered one earring, not sure why I did that because now I want a pair! Love the shape! I wear them all day, I don‚Äôt even take them off at night when I sleep..."
Fantastisch sch√∂ne und originelle Ohrringe. Ich trage diese sehr gerne.
"Also, die Ohrringe sind super. Klein, unaufgeregt und doch sehr besonders und sch√∂n."
"alles super, schnelle lieferung, schmuck gef√§llt"
These ear crawlers are so beautiful and really comfortable! I like them so much I ordered more pairs in different colors! Communication was great and shipping was fast. They also were packaged nicely. I can't say enough good things!
I love the earrings! Excellent craftsmanship and service
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."
These are different and beautiful!! I am happy with the purchase and would buy from this seller again.
"This is adorable little flowers, very beautifully made! Bought it as a gift to my daughter, I bet she will like it! Shipping was incredibly fast, seller is very communicative and kind! Thank you so much!"
"Absolutely love these, they‚Äôre so beautifully made. Lovely little hand written note was much appreciated aswell. Thanks so much :)"
The earrings look even better in person! Very detailed and beautiful.
These were my first pair of ear climbers and I'm so glad I got them. They're very pretty and dainty but easy to put on. The only time the fell was when I was on the phone and wasn't paying attention. I love them and got compliments on them!
These were my first foray into ear climbers. They were beautiful and dainty and perfect. So much so that I just gave them to my 16 year old neice for Christmas. She loved them!
"El pedido lleg√≥ r√°pido y en perfectas condiciones. Son los primeros pendientes de este estilo que tengo, ¬°y quedan preciosos! ‚ô•‚Äø‚ô• Son de gran calidad y su forma y tama√±o se adapta perfectamente a mis orejas."
Speedy delivery with friendly compliments card from supplier. Love the ear climbers which are very comfortable. Have been searching for just the right pair for some time and these are just what I need. Altogether enjoyable shopping experience. Thank you!
"Processed and shipped quickly! The earrings are beautiful. Unfortunately, I can't really get them to stay -- once I put them in it's only a few minutes before they turn down and are no longer crawling up my ear. These are my first pair of climbers so maybe I just don't really know how to wear them properly? I expected to be able to wear them as everyday earrings but I don't think it's practical. But the earrings are beautiful, thank you~"
So dainty and beautiful!
Love these. Beautiful and very feminine! Shipping was very fast!
Love love love these earrings! Thank you!
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them. Shipping was super fast by the way, well impressed! I highly recommend getting something from UrbanRaven, you can tell she makes her jewellery with a lot of love. :)"
"Even more beautiful in person! This is a gift for my mother's birthday, and I wouldn't have bought a special gift from anyone else. Everything is top quality, unique, and we'll made. This is my jewelry store!"
Love them. Subtle and beautiful. Thank you.
Even cuter than the picture! They are perfect. Thank you! :)
"These are fun, light weight and comfortable to wear! They go with everything."
Exactly like in the photo.
They were stunning. So delicate and feminine and shipped in a lovely box. I highly recommend this jeweler.
International shipping took what felt like forever! (I blame customs.) But these earrings are well worth the wait! They are incredible! Very fun yet also super classy. They arrived beautifully packaged with obvious attention to detail and thoughtfulness. I highly recommend this shop for the gorgeous artistry of the products and fantastic customer service. I will likely become a return customer.
"I purchased these earrings to wear on my wedding day and was blown away by their delicate loveliness, detail, and craftsmanship. Even prettier than the pictures and extremely well-made! The package arrived in good time with a pretty little box and a personal note from the jeweler. Very pleased with my purchase and experience <3 THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
I had ordered this gorgeous item for my father‚Äôs wedding. It paired beautifully with my red mermaid dress. I didn‚Äôt even need anything else because this earring made a bold statement!
"These earrings are gorgeous! Every Swarovski glass stone on its place. Beautifuly crafted! They came in a cute box, well protected. Illona does a great job and answered my messages within minutes. I am very happy with my purchase and would buy any time again. Thank you Illona"
These are beautiful and I am just in Love. Great fitting and has a clamp for the ear cuff to keep secure. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! Thank you Iloniti!! Great Customer Service!
These earrings are such high quality! Purchased them for my brother's wedding and they are absolutely perfect. My mom also purchased her earrings from this company and couldn't be happier!
I am so pleased with the quality of the jewelry I purchased. The geometric earrings are stunning and extremely unique. The communication with ArtiKats was fast and professional. I look forward to purchasing from this seller again!
"I love them! They're so pretty and elegant. I will definitely order in the future from ArtiKats. Also, the shop owner is very kind, because I ordered 2 pairs in 2 separate orders and she refunded me one of the shipping costs."
Eye catching! I love these earrings. I always get compliments when I wear them. So glad I bought them!
"These are stunning! Light and beautifully made, with a lovely texture and medium shine. They fit perfectly, and are make a statement, while being very easy and comfortably worn. Thanks!"
Amazing earrings....I love them! They are simply gorgeous and I cannot say enough about them. Excellent quality and so very unique. I cannot wait to show them off at an upcoming event I am attending....Fast shipping and fab convo with seller. Highly recommended!!!
"Arrived perfectly and beautifully wrapped with many packaging details. The earrings are stunning, my girlfriend has been wanting them for months and she's over the moon. Thank you, you are gifted!"
They are much more beautiful than the photo! I wore them right away to dinner and the server said they were so unique & sparkly. I will visit your shop again Vicki!! Thank you!
"Stunning & fabulous earrings!!!! Arrived on time!! Very satisfied and happy with my purchase!!! Thanks Arawen!!! I send You love, hugs & kisses from Mexico city!!! ;)"
I am so stoked about these new little ear climbers! Griffin was prompt in getting the package in the mail and answered all my questions. Buy from him! üëçüèª
"Absolutely love these earrings. I haven't taken them out since the day I got them in the mail. Very comfortable to wear and they're low-key, but I still do get compliments on them. Great experience buying them too! They arrived just in time for the day I originally needed them."
This is my first pair of ear climbers and I love them! They are super comfortable. I have been wearing them for one week and I forget they are in my ears. I have ordered a second pair to wear with this pair.
"Super cute!!! Easy to wear, comfy, as described, fast shipping. Easy to keep in and layer with dangling earrings. Trendy!!! Love!!! Also, thought the listing was for one but it's a set, bonus surprise."
"Considering I did not realize these were shipped from overseas until after ordering, the shipping was quite quick!! These earrings were packaged so beautifully and included some original art on a business card which was a lovely surprise. The earrings themselves are exactly as pictured and such a subtle but beautiful statement piece. Love them!"
Beautifully packaged. Very elegant and contemporary ear rings. So easy to wear. Absolutely love them. Thank you
Je les porte tous les jours dep√ªis que je les ai re√ßues. Je les supporte tr√®s bien. Elles tiennent nickel m√™me pendant la nuit. Aucune irritation.
Beautiful quality earrings! Arrived beautifully packaged and I've been wearing them since. Love them.
"Tout simplement sublime! Magnifique! ‚ù§ Trop beau, je suis trop contente de mon achat. Parfait pour les 2 photos souvenir que je voulais cadrer. Beau travail de la cr√©atrice. Emballage soign√©. Merci beaucoup."
"There was a minor shipping issue (no fault of the shipper, just the post office) but after that was resolved, we got the bowl and it is beautiful! The perfect gift for my husband and our 7th wedding anniversary! Thank you so much!!"
"On adore:) c‚Äôest super joli! Taille id√©ale pour notre fils qui portera les alliances ! Travail soign√©, qualitatif et envoi rapide:) Merci!!"
"Tout simplement sublime! Magnifique! ‚ù§ Trop beau, je suis trop contente de mon achat. Beau travail de la cr√©atrice. Emballage soign√©. Merci beaucoup."
My wife was over the moon!!
"Iv not got round to trying these on yet,their smaller than expected but still cute"
I ordered these as a present for my friend and she absolutely loves them! They look gorgeous - thank you!
These were beautiful. I cant wait to give them to my bridesmaids as gifts!
Absolutely love these! They're very good quality and heavier than expected (in a good way!) great seller too
Gold studs tarnished on first cleaning. Jackets are great quality. I get compliments all the time!
"I have bigger earlobes so whether or not an earring will accentuate that has always been my concern. These earring bars are the perfect size in terms of the length and the thickness, and I like that it's a round bar and not a square one. The back clasps are tight and secure and the posts are sterling silver, which are all great. To me they stand out amongst other Etsy bar earrings in all these features. What's worth noticing though is that the posts used here are slightly shorter and thicker than normally what you would see in stores (for example Claire's earrings). It has two dents at the end and only the second one fits my ear. Make sure you measure the earring posts you normally wear to avoid getting your ears squeezed and swollen!"
"Pulls a little pinker than expected but that‚Äôs how it is ordering jewelry online. Still very cute. Its a little hard to get the jacket secured on the post but they look great and are quality. Actually, editing and adding to the review a little later cause they tarnished so quickly, about a month or so later, without me even wearing them. I tried on once and decided they were for special occasions, but sitting in a separate jewelry box they tarnished and are now a super dark color. Almost a dirty penny. They don‚Äôt match any of my rose gold, so I can no longer use them."
Saw the ear jacket and immediately thought my rather alternative Friend would love it! And she did. Gift arrived on time for Christmas. I was absolutely happy with the customer service.
"Love this item, and the sellers. They worked with me to find exactly the right material for my cuff, as I'll be wearing it for my wedding. It arrived exactly when they said it would, and looks even better than the pictures! Very happy with this cuff!"
"Very pretty necklace! It is well made, shipped promptly, and the seller even included a little charm with my initial on it! My one critique is that the necklace chain is too long, especially for the size of the pendant, but it is easy to adjust the butted ring and clip the chain."
Obsessed!
Very cute! Just needs to be noted that it‚Äôs 3 pieces; I assumed they were 2. But it still looks amazing and I‚Äôm happy with it!
Beautiful craftsmanship and quality. I've had tons of compliments. I am picky about jewelry and want pieces that are unique but understated and these earrings are both.
"I love them so much, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
They are sooo pretty! I was surprised with how quick I received them. Will definitely order from this shop again.
The earrings are so beautiful! I got them for my sister and she simply loved them! They came right on time and it was such an easy process when ordering. It was really sweet too because they even emailed me to ask if the time of arrival was ok since it was after Christmas. So a sweet and kind. Truly love ordering from Etsy! Definitely. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!
I purchased the gold-plated marquise ear crawlers. They are gorgeous! Very high quality craftsmanship! I received them sooner than expected and in perfect condition. I have been wearing them all day and they are super comfortable (I forgot that I had them on) and attractive. Thank you so much!!
I love them!
"They are beautiful!!! Thanks so much, NOMA!"
This is the most stunning piece EVER!!! I am mesmerized by it. I cannot wait to buy more from this AMAZIng shop! The seller was most gracious. She is truly a masterful artist!
The ring is beautiful and my daughter absolutely loves it! It was the perfect 18th birthday gift!
Amazing final product- NOMA folks are fantastic to work with. I love it - thank you!!
"I was so excited when they came! I love how they look on my ears - the pic doesn't do them justice. Very comfortable to wear, too; it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing earrings."
"Absolutely beautiful! I've gotten so many compliments on them. Even better, my sensitive ears are also loving them! üòç"
"These dainty, beautiful leaf crawlers are absolutely stunning. They are perfect for my bridesmaids, I even bought an extra for myself because I know I‚Äôll wear them outside of my wedding day. I had excellent customer service! There were only 3 pairs of the specific earrings that I wanted left and when I asked her if there were anymore she said she was making more that week and they could be shipped out the following week! I love them and they came in a cute package for the girls to open! :)"
"Beautiful! I bought these for my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day, and I think that she will love them! The rose gold and purple look great together. The Shipping was exceptionally fast, and the packaging is very nice as well. Love supporting small businesses from Washington state! Thank you!"
"Sister-in-law loved my earrings from you, so I got her these as a birthday gift and they were a home run. Simple, chic and a little edgy."
Fits beautiful! I get so many compliments.
Earrings are beautiful and I get compliments from people I don't know every time I wear them. I love that they can be worn with or without the backing. Gorgeous craftsmanship!
I love these earrings. Megan has been wonderful & I've bought multiple items from her.
"So cute. Can be worn as an accent piece on either ear, maybe with an ear cuff to contrast. Worn on both ears, it's cute too! Feels sturdy, and can be secured by positioning the climber to desired spot then squeezing both sides closed. I thought it might be too big for my small ears andI'm glad I took the risk cause it paid off. Love the fact it's adjustable! Love the packaging too (tiny test tube securely wrapped in bubble wrap) and the silver-care instructions."
"Love these earrings and get lots of comments about them! Production and shipping were as specified, and it was great to be able to track them online once shipped. They were a little fiddly at the start, but once I got used to them i have no problem now putting them in and taking them out. Definitely recommend them!!"
People always ask me where I got these earrings when I wear them. I've gotten people hooked on Etsy by wearing these. Definitely a conversation piece!
Love these so much!!! I lost one and will be ordering another 2 pair just in case I lose any in the future. That's how much I love these!!!
Love love love these! Cannot even tell I have them in. They sit firm on the ear and don‚Äôt love around but in no way are too tight.
"I love how it fits to my ear, they feel like I don't have anything on. And love how they look on me too! Shipping took about a month though, but I don't mind! :)"
Love my gold climber earrings! I've already had a ton of compliments-- well worth the wait!
Perfect! So nice... Il love it! And arrived quickly at home !
"I couldn't love these earrings any more! I bought them for my co-worker and I as we work at a Fertility Clinic. Needless to say, they are a favourite amongst patients and staff. Very well made, super original, and fast shipping!!"
"Great item, exactly as described! Thanks a lot!"
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"These earrings are lovely, and great for the price! I love rose gold and these are so delicate. They shipped to me quickly and I had them in my hands a few days after ordering. Only advice is don't bend and unbend the back too much, as it's very flexible and could break off. But that shouldn't happen if you're just wearing it normally in your ear lobe."
Love these ferns! Easy to apply and adjust.
I absolutely love these earrings but my dog ended up liking them so much as well that he ate one so will be purchasing another set üòä
I looooove this product. The earrings are beautiful and so dainty!!
"Very nice, lightweight and unique!"
"This is the second ring I asked to be made for me, I contacted Valentini to see if there was a purple colour available & if she could make this ring slightly differently to add a variation to the one that I already have. She responded to my questions promptly & kept me updated with the making of the ring, also sent me a photo of some of the purple colours that she had available for me to choose from. I honestly cannot recommend this seller & shop enough, such quality items with a very fast dispatch & very well packaged in a pretty yet sturdy way as to not get damaged in transit. If you have any questions just go ahead & ask you will definitely not be disappointed with this seller or any of the products she makes. A+++"
These are a high quality beautiful earrings! Fast shipping. My wife loved them! Thanks enamelove!
Beautiful earrings! They are adjustable and can be worn multiple ways. Very clever!
Love these!!
Absolutely beautiful!
Look fab and fitted well üíï
Got to adjust to stay in place. Got to bend to stay as in the pictures
"These earrings are lovely! Exactly what I expected. They are a little too long for my ears, but they still fit and are the size I ordered. I've been wearing ear-climber earrings for a while and wanted to try a different style. :) They do look lovely, though! Also, the shop owner was very good with communicating when I asked a simple question about my shipment. Five stars!"
I love everything about these earrings! They're simple and sophisticated looking and made really well. Super fast shipping from Greece to the US as well. Thank you!
Love love love it!!!!
"Love them! They are exactly as in the picture, they look great in real life. They are of very good quality and the service of Kalypso Silver was the best!"
"ORIGINAL , LEGER ET FACILE A PORTER"
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles. Merci beaucoup!
"Longueur parfaite, belles mati√®res, brillantes, color√©es üíñ"
"Super cool earrings! Very unique, very chic, and subtle, but interesting.The hoop part was a bit thinner than I thought it would be, but no matter, these are still cool earrings! Great for every day. Quick shipping was a plus! Thank you so much"
The earrings are very delicate and beautiful. The quality is excellent and I love them!!
So elegant
Unique. Quick shipping. Smaller than they look photo but still great.
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
"These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)"

Boucles pendantes tr√®s sympas. Un peu longues pour moi mais faciles √† raccourcir.
Exactly as the foto. I love them!!
Achet√©es pour ma fille. Parfaites pour les premi√®res boucles pendantes d'une petite princesse !
"Article tr√®s sympa, boucles ayant une couleur sympa et transparente √† la fois. Merci pour votre s√©rieux et votre rapidit√©. Command√© mercredi soir et re√ßu vendredi matin."
i‚Äôm in love with my new earings. the quality is solid. they are super light weight which is hard to find in statement jewelry. wonderful customer service. thank you so much:)
"Ladies, I‚Äôm telling you.. the best light weight earrings and gorgeous. It can be complimented as casual and dressy! Best purchase to add to my jewelry wear."
"I love these earrings. I was looking for something like this for a while and I'm really glad I went with these ones. They are really light weight, don't irritate, and are comfortable even though they long. They make a great statement piece and still work if you have additional piercings. Highly recommend the earrings, they came faster than estimated and were beautifully packaged."
"These earrings are BREATHTAKING. The packaging was pristine and super neat, came with a lovely hand written note. The card the earrings are attached to is high quality and beautiful watercolor. I am so happy with this purchase and so excited to wear my new earrings! Thank you so much!!! :) I am so happy to be one of your first dozen orders!"
These were my first foray into ear climbers. They were beautiful and dainty and perfect. So much so that I just gave them to my 16 year old neice for Christmas. She loved them!
"El pedido lleg√≥ r√°pido y en perfectas condiciones. Son los primeros pendientes de este estilo que tengo, ¬°y quedan preciosos! ‚ô•‚Äø‚ô• Son de gran calidad y su forma y tama√±o se adapta perfectamente a mis orejas."
This set is beautiful!! I got the right ear climber and the left as the standard earring. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!
gorgeous! looks great as a pair (one on each ear) and looks great with the crawler on one ear depending on the hairdo- very very happy with the purchase of both!!!!!!!
"One of the jewel‚Äôs prongs weren‚Äôt closed, so that one got loose and I had to fix it. Definitely love my earrings though!!! They are perfect for my big day."
"These are so cool looking, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!! They are a little on the heavy side so I probably will wear them only for the reception (not the ceremony) but they are going to look SO GOOD with my leather jacket! Just an FYI these are glamorous enough that you probably don‚Äôt need a necklace with them!"
Absolutely stunning. I got the necklace and matching bracelet. Love it!
Gorgeous!
These earrings are super pretty! I had some initial issues with my order and Carolina was awesome about communicating with me and sending me a new package! The second package arrived super fast and with a free gift too!
Boucles d'oreilles tr√®s sympa. Merci beaucoup. Agathe
"alles wie beschrieben, gut verpackt"
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
Magnifique boucle. Original et sympa
"Very beautiful design. But, the color is not as the bright yellow as the picture showed."
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
"So beautiful! I was impressed when I opened the lovely box to see those 2 very delicate ear climbers. I was afraid it would be too big or not delicate enough when I ordered it, it's not. It's just perfect, beautifully made. The shipping was very fast and carefully made. Charlie was very nice. I will definitly follow this shop and look up for new items soon."
"These are absolutely stunning! I've put them on as soon as they arrived and not taken them off...so delicate and pretty. The customer service was spectacular, I'll definitely return for more shiny x"
Very helpful & pleasant seller. Climber earrings really pretty and classy looking. Very nicely made & boxed - perfect as I bought these as a Christmas gift. Arrived very quickly.
I really love these earrings. Good quality and super cute.
Love these earrings! The design is simple/minimalist but really effective - much more interesting than the norm with the circular jacket behind the stud earring. Thank You!
"Just received my rings (3) . They‚Äôre what I wanted; simple , classic , minimalist style. Definitely a shop worth revisiting. X Gracias üòä"
These earrings are gorgeous! I've already gotten so many compliments on them.
"They look beautiful. Unfortunately they do not stay put and don't look like climbers when u wear them. They don't look like climbers when you wear them. they edges fall down. The earring BROKE only my SECOND time wearing it. shame, they were very pretty"
"Beautiful earrings, excellent quality. Highly recommend."
Perfect. As described. Thank you!
"Love it! Minimal, modern climber that will be my go-to accessory. Came in cute packaging and fast deliver."
Delivered quickly and the ear climbers are of excellent quality. I've gotten so many compliments! I will definitely be buying from ViaFrancesca in the future.
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
"I have been looking a VERY long time for dangle diamond jackets. These are beautiful, unique and exactly what I was looking for! I love them."
"Amazing earrings, simple but elegant! Lightweight and comfortable, I'm already wearing them! Thank you!!!"
These ear climbers are beauties! Rose gold is my new color and I am lovin these!
Love this earring! It was the perfect staple jewelry that I wore to a wedding! Received so many compliments and it stayed in during a night full of dancing
"This came in the post, (took 2weeks from order date until I received it in Portugal) and I am pleased with it. It's pretty and dainty, worth the wait! I wear it in my helix piercing but it's difficult to photograph so just for this photo I put it in my main earlobe. Seller is great and answers questions fast, thank you. Will be buying more. :)"
"Bought these as a present for my sister's birthday. They are even more beautiful and intricate in person, she loved them! The packaging is lovely, and the seller was very considerate keeping me posted on where the package was/when it was sent, and it was delivered very quickly! Very happy with my purchase, will definitely be buying more from this shop :)"
I bought a garnet pair of these from Monica 3 years ago and they've been great so I decided to buy a second pair. They're lovely quality and I'm really pleased with them. Happy with the quick delivery and friendly service too. I definitely recommend this shop.
Absolutely love these earrings!! Had lots of compliments. Thank you üòÅ
Purchased as a gift and was very well received. Quick delivery and nicely packaged. Will definitely be making another purchase in future x
"L√©ger, r√©glable,beaux coloris.Je suis satisfaite."
"Tr√®s belle cr√©ation! Super rendu mati√®res et coloris, qualit√© et l√©g√®ret√©. Livraison rapide, emballage soign√©, tout est parfait! Merci beaucoup =) +++"
"Ce noeud papillon en bois est vraiment super ! Le colis est soign√©, envoy√© dans une petite bo√Æte logot√©e du nom de la boutique, avec une carte de visite. Envoi rapide et tr√®s bon contact avec la vendeuse. Je recommande !"
Envoi tr√®s rapide. Emballage costaud. Une jolie petite bo√Æte est fournie! Les boucles d'oreilles sont juste magnifiques! Il n'y a pas √† dire: je suis fan et je recommande cette boutique!!
arrived in good time and my wife was delighted
These are amazing!! Haha So pretty!!<3 I got them for my sister for Christmas and she's going to love them!! Great service!! <3 :)
My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead- instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.
"It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that‚Äôs to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!"
"These are earrings I wear every day, clean once in a while and put back in. They are perfect for me! I have several ear holes and these go in the bottom. It took a long time for them to get to me... but worth the wait! Love them. Exactly as pictured. Great shop!"
"Very delicate piece of work. I absolutely love the versatility and design of this earring! And it arrived in less than 10 days. The only thing I don‚Äôt love that much is putting it and removing it - as it has three pieces and they are quite small, it can be a blind guess to pick the correct height. But we can‚Äôt have everything, right? Otherwise, a perfect choice for a versatile person!"
I've gotten SO many compliments on these-I absolutely love them. Thank you!
Super belles :) üòä
They are sooo pretty! I was surprised with how quick I received them. Will definitely order from this shop again.
The earrings are so beautiful! I got them for my sister and she simply loved them! They came right on time and it was such an easy process when ordering. It was really sweet too because they even emailed me to ask if the time of arrival was ok since it was after Christmas. So a sweet and kind. Truly love ordering from Etsy! Definitely. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!
I purchased the gold-plated marquise ear crawlers. They are gorgeous! Very high quality craftsmanship! I received them sooner than expected and in perfect condition. I have been wearing them all day and they are super comfortable (I forgot that I had them on) and attractive. Thank you so much!!
I love them!
"The earrings are stunning, high quality, and look exactly like the picture. The customer service is great too, 10/10 definitely recommend!"
"I am so in love with these earrings! Everything about this purchase was amazing. These are my favourite everyday pair, thank you!"
I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit. Only issues are putting them on and taking them off is a challenge because they are very small and have 3 pieces to manage. I've dropped the pieces several times. But that's getting better with practice.
"absolutely beautiful, gladly again!!!"
"I LOVE THESE! They look elegant, simple, they are beautiful and made very well. They came as expected when I ordered them in a pretty box with instructions how to put them on. I recommend 10/10"
Stunning earrings! Very elegant and easy to put on. Will definitely be buying from this shop again! Love!
These earring are beautiful!! I have loved wearing them. They are prefect for wanting a statement earring that doesn‚Äôt get tangled with my face mask.
Gorgeous and easy to use. Fast shipping very happy with my purchase ‚ò∫
"Envoi rapide et soign√©, cr√©atrice adorable, √©maux magnifiques, je suis ravie !!! :) :) :)"
These are truly fantastic birds. Very happy with my purchase.
parfait comme toujours dans cette boutique !
Beautiful! Love the Fast Shipping!
"Got these as a gift for my sibling‚Äîwho is really artsy and hard to buy for‚Äîand they really liked them! Success! It did take a long time to arrive, but that was expected coming from Israel, and I think they still arrived on time if not earlier than projected."
"beautiful and well made, thank you!"
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. It‚Äôs such a dainty ring and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it.
I originally bought these for my bridesmaids back in 2019 and kept checking back for a year hoping these would come back in stock so I could buy a pair for myself. So thankful they came back and I could get a pair! They are beautiful!!
Love my crawlers!! I get soooo many compliments on them! Thanksüòò
I haven‚Äôt taken these off since I received them. The are quality items that are firm (unlike ones I‚Äôve brought before). Love these!
Absolutely love these earrings. They're so pretty!
Took a long time to get them but worth the wait.
I LOVE these! They are so well made and beautiful!
"i love these earrings, pictures don't do them justice, they feel like a solid piece of jewelry, heavy and effective"
"Great design, as beautiful as expected :)"
Beautiful and delicate earrings!
"Ravie ! Exp√©dition rapide et soign√©e et surtout, BO superbes. Tout √† fait conformes √† mes attentes !"
"The first time I saw them I was starstruckü§©. When I need extra sparkle in my life I wear my divine earings. I shine like a real star when I have them on. I love the design very creative,great equality, and excellent craftsmanship. Even with the Covid, I received them on time. Great customer service and friendly staff.Thank You againüíóDolores"
"Magnifique bracelet et original. Il encore plus beau que sur la photo , je l adore !!"
Merci Ysa !! La bague est MAGNIFIQUE encore plus jolie en vrai üòä
"These are great! Discreet yet original, exactly what I was looking for. Fine quality and comfortable to boot. My order came quickly and was very well packaged, thanks. Would definitely recommend!"
"Love all of the items so much! Bought 5 different pairs and they are all great and true to the pictures, will def purchase more from the bohominimalist! I was a bit afraid that they would get lost if shipped to the US but they arrived exactly within the right period of time! Thank you so much for your patience and assistance with me Sanne! :)"
Got them in the mail this morning! Beautiful earrings! Love them!!
Beautiful and unique!!
"Great product! I love these! Amy made these slightly less curved for me, since my ear is straighter and I was placing them in the 2nd whole up my ear. I had to bend them slightly to be a little straighter. They fit perfectly in the groove of my ear and stay put very well!"
I love them! So dainty!
"These earrings are great, they're so simple yet so elegant at the same time. I can wear them anywhere! The metal is beautiful and the shop is very easy to work with and reliable. Keep up the good work! :)"
"Beautiful earrings. Her work is brilliant. Not sure what on reviewer meant that they were not packaged ready to gift. I thought it was perfect for a gift. Great customer service, quick shipping. Highly recommend shopping with her."
"Katrien is an incredible artist and brilliant on her comms! As stated in her shop ""About"" section, these pieces take time to arrive but gosh, are they worth it. She sent a free pair of groovy posts along with the ear jackets which was an unexpected and wonderful gift. I'm in love with these earrings and massive props to this working, loving mama!! xx"
"I swapped the orange for white, love these earrings."
I LOVE these. So funky and unique. Had loads of comments on them :) x
"i LOVE these earrings! they are super fun! I sometimes get irritation when wearing earrings, but these stayed on all day and felt great. I'm not an expert on metals, but I suspect it's because it has some quality stuff in there, thank you!"
I love my new earrings! The size is perfect and they are not heavy at all. Pure silver! No problems with the delivery. I am extremely happy with this purchase :)
"Wir sind ganz begeistert von Carolines wundervollen Bechern, die Motive sind ein Traum und werden von den Kindern immer wieder neu bestaunt. Der Kontakt mit Caroline war sehr intensiv und sehr nett, ich kann Aesthet bedingungslos weiterempfehlen!!!"
"Je l‚Äôai offert √† ma s≈ìur, elle adore et moi aussi!!! La broche est superbe. Merci encore, je ne peux que recommander votre boutique! +++++"
The package came in a great amount of time and my boyfriend loved the quality! I definitely recommend ‚ô•Ô∏è
"Very beautiful!! Didn't regret waiting a little longer to receive it (it came from France to the US, so the wait was actually normal)."
"Wore it on my wedding day looked amazing and with a few adjustment fit perfectly on my head, I wore it all night."
"I wore these in gold for my wedding day and absolutely loved them. The earrings are a perfect size, high quality, and just as pictured. Thank you!"
"I love these earrings - I ordered them specifically for a wedding in which I was the made of honor, along with the leaf arm cuff. Everyone said I looked like a Grecian goddess with these pieces on. I myself felt kind of like Wonder Woman too with these strong but very feminine pieces. I'll definitely be wearing them again for other occasions too. The seller also made sure I got these in time for the wedding, even though I ordered them just days ahead of time and she ships from Israel (I'm in the US). She was quick to respond to all my questions and concerns about the shipping time. I hope to order more in the future!"
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
"If I could give 10 stars I would!! I absolutely LOVE THESE, they are perfect and just what I wanted!! They seem to be good quality (I‚Äôll update this if they aren‚Äôt) and the shipping was super fast (I live in the US). They are small just like I hoped, for reference my second lobes are 4-5mm from the piercing to the bottom of my ear. I am so glad I bought these, there was even a free gift included! Now usually when there is a free jewelry gift, it is cheaper and not something I would actually wear; but these came with little gold rocket ship earrings with green emerald stones üò≠üò≠üò≠ I love both earrings so much!!!!"
Amazing earrings!! Omg I‚Äôm so in love with them and the quality of them. If you‚Äôre looking for cute jewelry that will have people asking you questions about them nonstop then this is the shop for you. Truly impressed and couldn‚Äôt be happier with them. Will definitely be purchasing again in the near future and letting my family and friends know!
"Absolutely love my stud earrings! They are exactly what I was looking for and amazing quality! And what‚Äôs more, they sent me a bonus huggie pair which I was not expecting! All of it came in the cutest packaging/ protective pouch! I will definitely be buying more! Highly recommend"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Loved the branding, it was quick, and the earrings are my new favorites! They are gorgeous. I was going on here to let the shop know they accidentally sent me another set of earrings, but see that another review said they did it as well as a thank you. I am floored. I will be recommending this shop and buying more for sure!! <3"
"Quality is great! I got the rose gold and loved my pick, the picture is accurate! Love my new earrings üòÑüòÑüòÑ"
Absolutely beautiful and go from day to night effortlessly. I ordered the brass and the quality is wonderful. I hadn't anticipated it but there are at least 3 different ways to combine the pieces and wear the studs. Love!
"Beautiful rose gold earrings. They were delivered very fast to Ottawa, Canada and are absolutely gorgeous. Everyone who has seen me wearing them has commented on them. A very good purchase in my opinion. I highly recommend these."
I‚Äôm super impressed with this product! Amazing artistry I will be buying another pair in gold!! So unique and different !
"I absolutely love my earrings! They fit my ears perfectly, and the detail and craftsmanship is exquisite! The Earrings reflect the beauty and delicate nature of the fern. Thank you so much, I am a very happy customer!"
I love these earrings! Very comfortable to wear. They're so pretty and dainty. This shop is amazing! Will definitely be buying from them again.
Second time purchasing from Lovebird Jeweller. Speedy delivery/exquisite craftswomanship and presentation. Would 100% buy from Lovebird Jeweller again.
"I loved these when I saw them. I wanted something different but not too flamboyant (cause that's not really my style). Once I got the hang of putting them on my ears, they stayed comfortably and I would forget I even had them on."
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I previously ordered the matching earrings and now I have the pendant in the rose gold color. They‚Äôre beautiful and elegant. They are very versatile and can easily be worn with evening attire to casual attire and however you choose to wear them. The earrings are also comfortable and that‚Äôs one of the requirements for me. The chain that comes with the pendant is very small/narrow/thin and the clasp is as well. I have already have a different chain and a choker that I will use the pendant on. I highly recommend the pendant and the earrings.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
Beautiful earrings! I had mine made as studs and with silver and there were no issues. They are gorgeous and comfy to wear. I paid for express shipping and they arrived (in Australia!) very quickly. I look forward to wearing them for my university graduation in May. Would order again!
Tr√®s beau bracelet que je vais offrir √† mon conjoint pour No√´l ! Je pense qu'il lui plaira !
"Merci pour l'envoi attentionn√©, mon amie adore votre broche"
Todo perfecto. Muy contento con la comprea.
I LOVE these earrings!! They are so unique! This is my first time wearing earrings with a jacket and I really like the way they look. They aren't too heavy and I like the contrast of the stone with the metal. I have already ordered another piece from this shop! The seller is very nice to work with as well!
Absolutely adore these erings!
Witchy! Love it
"It took a bit to come in, but I absolutely love these earrings. It comes with the crescent moon/horn part being detachable, so the earrings can be worn with or without them. It's basically like having two pairs of earrings! They're also very good quality - the metal doesn't bend and it has a small notch in the metal to prevent the backs from coming off on accident. Definitely worth the money I paid for these."
I love these! So cute! I never thought I'd buy these kind because I was afraid of how they would wear but they are very durable and easy to put on. Glad I got them now. Shipped fast and the seller is really nice to work with.
Love these crawlers! I‚Äôve been liking for a replacement pair for 3+years!!
"Cute! They don't fit my ears very well, I can't seem to get them to stay on tight. So I will give them away."
Beautiful. I get compliments everytime I wear them. Thanks!
Ravie de mon achat. Envoi soign√©. Tr√®s jolie boucle d'oreille
Envoi soign√© et agr√©able √† ouvrir. Les boucles d'oreilles sont l√©g√®re √† porter. Parfaite
"Parfait, je suis tr√®s contente de ma bague, tr√®s originale ! Merci !"
I love it!This necklace is so great!
Love it! I got the purple jewel and wear it for my septum ring. It's subtle enough and unique enough. A couple friends noticed and said it's super cute and really fits my style.
"I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect out of ordering jewelry online, but this septum ring was exactly what I wanted - Perfect diameter and gauge & the color was exactly as expected. I put it next to a household key for size reference. Would order another one :)"
Love them so much !
They are so pretty! I love them.
"Just lovely! I forgot to remove them last night because they are so comfortable. They appear delicate, but withstood the night well."
Absolutely love them!!! And the work well with my other earrings
"Unique,carefully carved. Posted in time withouth any trouble."
"These are subtle but trendy, and I love them. They showed up as expected and are simple to put in/takeout. Wearing almost every day."
So here it goes - the wait was excruciating. It took forever but boy was it worth it! They are beautiful. I am truly in love with them and as greedy as my nature is I will be coming back for more! There is still lapis and sweet turquoises to be had!
"I love this idea, it's a very pretty look. Thank you!!"
"I'd be glad to review it if it were not still away across the country in Montreal, according to the tracking report. It's been stuck there a long time, so I hope somebody can get the package moving again. The package has arrived, and I'm delighted. It's especially useful to have the included little jar to keep the silver safe from tarnish. Thanks!"
"I loved the packaging! The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give five stars was that the stones weren‚Äôt as brilliant as the picture depicted. After I shined the ear climbers throughly it looked a lot better. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase!"
"Nice earrings, as expected. Nicely packaged, and I received them pretty fast. They are very delicate- I bent them a little bit while I was cleaning them. And the backings are SO SMALL!! They were really hard to get on the earring when they were in my ears. I have never seen earring backings as tiny as these. It's not a matter of the post being smaller than average, because I used earring backings from another pair, and they fit just fine."
"These are really cute! The stars are cut cleanly and they look like they do in the photos. They are comfortable to wear and easy to clean. This is the second set of earrings I've purchased (the other is a different star crawler) and the quality is consistent from this seller. They seem delicate, but they've held up quite nicely so far."
Perfect and they look so good in my third hole travling up my whole ear
Love these earrings. I wanted something small and cute for a second hole piercing. These are perfect! They arrived quickly too!
Just beautiful. I've had a lot of comments asking where I got them and pointed them in your direction. Thank you! Good quick delivery too. xxx
"Great earrings, great style! They are delicate, very elegant and so original but a bit smaller than expected. They come in their own little box. I get hundreds of compliments when wearing them!"
"As always, beautiful product, fast international shipping. I get most of my earrings from Shlomit Ofir, and I get so many compliments! Love this designer."
Vendeuse √† l'√©coute et tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles. Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de cet achat.
"Oof, I love this earring. I had it in my wishlist for so long and I am very happy that I finally got it. Things to know, the metal is extremely thin and easily bendable. To me, this is a good thing. What I didn't notice from the pictures is that the lobe portion pushes your lobe forward a bit and can look a little unflattering, but it is easy to ever so slightly bend the metal where it needs to go. I also have extremely hard cartilage that gets irritated easily so I was able to make the curve in the top a little wider to accommodate my ear. Last thing to know if it is not wide earphone friendly. The earring will hit the pause button on my raycons, haha! Again, not much of an issue, I just adjust it and I'm good. I've worn them all day (paired with the threader long threader earring to make that asymmetrical look)."
"I wasn't sure how I would like this, but I am not exaggerating when I say I love this earring so much!!! I am a lazy person when it comes to jewelry and always prefer to keep earrings in, then forget about them. While I can't, and definitely wouldn't recommend sleeping with it on, it is always immediately back in my ear once I wake up. I can't recommend this shop/earring enough! Love it!"
This is my first time seeing earrings that look like this and it looks amazing! It's such a unique look! I'm definitely going to buy more of this style of earring
I love this piece of jewelry it‚Äôs unique and gets a lot of attentionüôÇ the first couple times I wore it I realize that I have to keep an eye on it when dawning my Covid mask. I found when I took my mask from around my ear I saw the earring on the ground so I hv to remain conscious that its there - its so light weighted! I just got to be careful n touch my ear now n then to make sure it‚Äôs still there! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too big I did get the large I think the small might be too small but I think I would have the same issue but I love it! thank you. Customer support was great because I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to get the large or the small and I measured my ear as instructed and was advised on the large. A Beautiful piece of jewelryüôÇ
"They are beautiful!!! Thanks so much, NOMA!"
This is the most stunning piece EVER!!! I am mesmerized by it. I cannot wait to buy more from this AMAZIng shop! The seller was most gracious. She is truly a masterful artist!
The ring is beautiful and my daughter absolutely loves it! It was the perfect 18th birthday gift!
Amazing final product- NOMA folks are fantastic to work with. I love it - thank you!!
"LOVE my silver earrings! They arrived on time and add a simple, yet elegant look to any outfit. I receive compliments every time I wear them! highly recommend!"
"I love these rings!!!! I already have 2 and have bought additional 2 as gifts and they'be been a huge hit! I have sensitive skin but have had these on for over 2 weeks now with no issues or irritations. I sometimes forget i even have them on, until i get compliments on them!Thank you"
The earrings arrived fast and they look great as described. I think my ear lobes are too small for this type of ear crawler cause they don't hold it and they slip off my ear. But when on the right place they look beautiful
Beautiful Jeweler and lovely spirit!!!
"This is the second ring I asked to be made for me, I contacted Valentini to see if there was a purple colour available & if she could make this ring slightly differently to add a variation to the one that I already have. She responded to my questions promptly & kept me updated with the making of the ring, also sent me a photo of some of the purple colours that she had available for me to choose from. I honestly cannot recommend this seller & shop enough, such quality items with a very fast dispatch & very well packaged in a pretty yet sturdy way as to not get damaged in transit. If you have any questions just go ahead & ask you will definitely not be disappointed with this seller or any of the products she makes. A+++"
These are a high quality beautiful earrings! Fast shipping. My wife loved them! Thanks enamelove!
Beautiful earrings! They are adjustable and can be worn multiple ways. Very clever!
"Well, where can I start to explain just how amazing not only this seller is but the craftsmanship that has gone into making this ring. The seller answered all of my questions promptly, also made the ring to my requirements, it's absolutely stunning, simply beautiful & effective, well made also dispatched quickly & it arrived in next to no time. I would definitely recommend this seller & her craftsmanship, so don't delay just buy, you won't regret it."
"It was a little bit smaller than I expected. However, the quality was great!! I LOVE the design but it's not stable to wear it. That's why I gave the seller four stars. I think that it depends on your ear shape. I'll be back to purchase other earrings sometime soon. :)"
shipped fairly quick despite the chaos in the world and they were a bit smaller than what i expected but fit perfect!! never seen a pair of earrings like this I really like them!
STUNNING! I LOVE YOUR STUFF! THANK YOU! I WILL RETURN!
I wear this all the time. Love it!
Exactly as the foto. I love them!!
A DEPENDABLE SELLER !! !!
"Comme les bleues, article tr√®s sympa √©galement, boucles √©toiles que j'appr√©cie vraiment. Merci pour votre s√©rieux et votre rapidit√©. Command√© mercredi soir et re√ßu vendredi matin. Je recommande..."
Yes it shipped on time. Absolutely perfect for the pendants want to wear it with. Love them.
SO unusual. Get tons of compliments. And came so quick! All the way from Greece.
"Super fast shipping, very solid piece! Absolutely love it!"
I LOVE these ear jackets. Super chic. VERY wearable. Beautifully made. Came in good time and in a lovely well dressed box. Stunning.
GORGEOUS earrings! I love them!!
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
"Delivery took a little longer than I expected, but the seller was great and even offer to send another so I would get it on time. The earrings are small but lovely my 15 year old niece adores them and I have now ordered a 2nd pair for my sister. Great hypoallergenic too my niece can sleep in them without a reaction."
"Excellent work, I keep coming back to this store again and again. I looove my earrings!"
"Very pretty, lightweight earrings. Love the way they look!"
Very beautiful and unique earrings. Shipping and communication was great =)
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
"Magnifique ! √Ä la bonne taille, r√©sistant, brillant, je suis fan ! Un grand merci !ü•∞"
"Very pretty and well shipped. Please turned out to be a little bit too long for my ears, keeping them anyway since they are lovely."
So elegant looking! I can definitely wear to work.
"Beautiful, delicate looking, yet well made. When I wore it the first time, even my husband noticed and thought they were beautiful. Customer service was stellar (my questions regarding the earrings were answered promptly, the earrings were dispatched on time). My personal style trend towards a more classic look. However, I noted a variety of styles for various ages and fashion sense displayed in her store. So I bought a few more pieces as Christmas gifts for my mom in law, sister and daughters and snuck another earring climber in for myself!"
Perfect ear climber for my third hole. Very happy with everything that I purchased. And shipping was very fast!
Tr√®s jolie boucles de qualit√© ! Ravie de mon achat
Ich bin begeistert wie schnell der Versand ging und wie wundervoll die Ohrringe sind. Sind in echt noch sch√∂ner als auf den Bildern. Absolute Kaufempfehlung ‚ù§
I love this earrings. I have received so many compliments on them. Perfectly cute and small enough for my ear
"These are pretty, but really, really thin. I had to bend the post back to keep the earrings in place on my ears. Since they are supposed to be ""climbers"", the straight post doesn't hold them in place. Would be better with a curved one. But, I still like them and have received compliments."
These are so beautiful and simple. They make any look edgy and minimalistic. I'm obsessed!
"The earrings were a little longer than I expected, but it ended up working out. I get compliments every day and one girl from the market said that she never wears earrings but would totally wear these. What a compliment to this seller! Thanks for making such unique products!"
"Quick shipping, very nice and attentive shop owner and the earrings look amazing üòä Im very happy with my purchase."
Tr√®s beau bracelet que je vais offrir √† mon conjoint pour No√´l ! Je pense qu'il lui plaira !
"Merci pour l'envoi attentionn√©, mon amie adore votre broche"
Todo perfecto. Muy contento con la comprea.
Love my earrings so much! I sleep and shower in them! And I usually can‚Äôt sleep with earrings on so I‚Äôm surprised I can get away with these
I bought these earrings for my wedding but I don't want to wait to wear them! They are so pretty!
Very cute earrings! Love them.
My friend loved the earrings :) wore them for the rest of the day she was obsessed with the feel and look
i‚Äôm in love with my new earings. the quality is solid. they are super light weight which is hard to find in statement jewelry. wonderful customer service. thank you so much:)
"Ladies, I‚Äôm telling you.. the best light weight earrings and gorgeous. It can be complimented as casual and dressy! Best purchase to add to my jewelry wear."
"I love these earrings. I was looking for something like this for a while and I'm really glad I went with these ones. They are really light weight, don't irritate, and are comfortable even though they long. They make a great statement piece and still work if you have additional piercings. Highly recommend the earrings, they came faster than estimated and were beautifully packaged."
"These earrings are BREATHTAKING. The packaging was pristine and super neat, came with a lovely hand written note. The card the earrings are attached to is high quality and beautiful watercolor. I am so happy with this purchase and so excited to wear my new earrings! Thank you so much!!! :) I am so happy to be one of your first dozen orders!"
"Beautiful earrings! Excellent craftsmanship. I purchased as a pair to wear as a set. My only minor complaint is that the gauge of the wire/post was thicker than my ears are typically used to. It was a bit of a struggle to get them in, and it hurt a little bit as my holes were stretched. I‚Äôve worn them every day for almost a week now, and the pain was minimal and only lasted a day or two. Shipping was incredibly fast."
"L‚Äôorecchino e‚Äô esattamente come immaginavo , soddisfazione 100%"
"These huggie earrings are so pretty! I scrupulously took measurements before I purchased them, but I was still taken aback at just how tiny they are! They are teeny tiny, but delightfully sparkly + perfect! Super fast processing and shipping (purchased Friday; delivered Monday‚Äì‚Äìhalf-way across the US). Very pleased with this purchase. Thank you!! ** top right photo is the huggie in second piercing next to a 3mm stud."
"I am very satisfied with this large 14KT gold diamond climber earring. I chose to buy two to wear as a pair of earrings and they look very nice on the ears. I felt the color of the gold was very nice, not that tarnish dull look, had some slight heft of weight that you could initially feel in your hand when you first picked one or both up. The diamonds aren‚Äôt huge, dull, or yellowish cloudy and they are not chips, which I did not totally expect, but they definitely have to pass that ‚Äúquality‚Äù and ‚Äúsparkle‚Äù factor for me to keep my purchase, which I am very happy to say, and recommend this seller to anyone for being highly recommended first before spending and going to your brick and mortar stores when in reality these pieces are as well just as beautiful but by giving you a by far better value."
I purchased the SS Left and heart set and they are beautiful!
These are wonderful. Unique and perfect for the Maui lover. Thank you. They are a treasure.
Such a cute set! Fit my ears perfectly. Loved that it came quick too!
Love! Love! Amazing customer service and did custom work to keep the earring from falling out. Just love it!
I love my new earrings! The size is perfect and they are not heavy at all. Pure silver! No problems with the delivery. I am extremely happy with this purchase :)
"Such a beautiful earrings! I was looking for a stylish jewellery and Iolite's earrings suceed my expectations. Good quality, unique and totally handmade gems. I couldn't be happier! Elena answered all my questions and I feel now wearing a signature's earrings. Amazing!"
I LOVE this piece so much! So simple and elegant! Took a bit to ship but I really didn‚Äôt mind at all. Will definitely purchase from this shop again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"These earrings are the most unique I have ever worn, so delicate and special, I can tell and fee that they were made with love and care. I love them so much :)"
"This earring is simply gorgeous. Finished to perfection, elegant but original at the same time, arrived quickly and well packaged, truly gorgeous. And Elena, the owner, is a very kind person with whom it is a real pleasure to communicate. Highly recommended shop, will definitely buy again!"
"Not only is this a VERY talented artist, she is also a super sweet lady! I am already a repeat customer and will be back. Beautiful, well made jewelry at an awesome price... How can you go wrong? Thank you SO much!!!!"
Again my wife loves these earrings. Thank you.
"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
"Ravie ! Exp√©dition rapide et soign√©e et surtout, BO superbes. Tout √† fait conformes √† mes attentes !"
"The first time I saw them I was starstruckü§©. When I need extra sparkle in my life I wear my divine earings. I shine like a real star when I have them on. I love the design very creative,great equality, and excellent craftsmanship. Even with the Covid, I received them on time. Great customer service and friendly staff.Thank You againüíóDolores"
"Magnifique bracelet et original. Il encore plus beau que sur la photo , je l adore !!"
Merci Ysa !! La bague est MAGNIFIQUE encore plus jolie en vrai üòä
"This has been by far one of my best purchases on Etsy. The earring itself is beautifully crafted, with a pearl which is elegant and perfectly sized. I was pleasantly surprised with the earring's weight as well. I expected it to be significantly heavier but in truth I barely notice that I have it on. The shop's owner responds fast, is extremely easy to communicate with, very friendly and puts a lot of care into packaging and posting her jewelry. She even included a beautiful necklace as a gift! Great shop, great owner, will definitely come back for more!"
"Bought these for my girlfriend. Shipped perfectly on time to Canada. She absolutely loves them, super unique. She likes that you can wear the pearls by themselves and add the moons for going out at night."
"Beautiful, I love it! Maybe the bar of the moon is a bit long for me and tend to hurt a little. But it is worth it ;)"
such a lovely seller to deal with. The item was just as shown in the photo and she even sent me a little present. The packaging is beautiful too!
"Love these ear climbers! This pair is a replacement for a pair I had for years, but lost one. I wear these in my third earring hole only, so I had to manually adjust them slightly for the perfect fit. It was easy to do, and the seller walked me through the process. I get so many compliments on these!"
i've never had climber so I am looking forward to wearing them. So far I have won them down. I love opals and I love these!
"Tiffany is absolutely amazing! So sweet and helpful and wonderful, will make custom items for you, I very enormously recommend Tiffany and Micah‚Äôs shop!!!"
Super cute!!
"Arrived quickly, and well packaged, and looks just as shown/described in the photos. Very cool when worn...I really like it. Thanks very much! üôÇ"
"So so cute! It's dainty enough to wear with everything, but when it catches the light, you can see the zig-zig. Had a few compliments and couldn't recommend buy it enough!"
I am OBSESSED OMG!!! The only thing is that it took about a month to get to me but totally worth the waitü•∞üß°
I love this earring. It‚Äôs the perfect size for my cartilage and seems really sturdy like it won‚Äôt randomly un clip. It‚Äôs also the perfect size to where my hair doesn‚Äôt get stuck in it (really annoying part of cartilage piercings lol). It doesn‚Äôt seem to be rusting or losing its shine either (never take it out). Thanks so much!!!!
Looks great! Thank you so much!
It is a Christmas present. I think my daughter will love them.
"I bought my first pair of these in gold at WolfBait in Logan Square, Chicago. I had them for years and they were pretty much the only earrings I would wear. I was recently on a long walk and one of my earrings fell out. I couldn't find the missing piece so I decided to buy some new ones online. I saw that MinimaMaxima was in the process of moving (congrats!) and I requested an alert when the shop opened back up. As soon as I got the notification, I logged in and added a pair of these to my cart...I didn't even know they came in rose gold! My order arrived super quickly and was packed beautifully and with care. I LOVE the business card and packaging. I am so ecstatic to have these and I plan on buying another (backup) pair soon! Thank you all so much!"
"Full discloser: I haven't worn them yet, so I don't feel that I can give a 5 star rating at this time. It hasn't quite been a month since I got my ears pierced. Just a bit longer and then they can be shown off! I feel fierce, Art Deco-esque vibes just looking at them. I love that these are lightweight earrings. They won't contribute to sagging earlobes later. The design is unique. Nina is very friendly, professional and helpful."
Very pretty!
"These came so quick and I absolutely love them, great quality for a cheap price"
They are beautiful to wear. They sit so well on the ear. thankyou
"Excellent quality item, prompt communication, amazing service, express postage"
"Beautiful earrings, faster than expected shipping to US from France. Seller is lovely. Thank you ü§ç"
Envoi rapide et soign√©. Les boucles sont superbes. Encore plus en vrai qu'en photo. Je ferais d'autres commandes sans h√©sitation.
Re√ßu rapidement. Ravie de mon achat. Elles sont superbes.
Trop chouette ! Merci ! <3
"A crap photo, but that doesn't mean I love them any less! Rough finish, a little wobbly, but very sleek and minimal. Love, love, love."
"Love love these tiny earrings. They are exactly what I was looking for. First day I didn't take them off, they came off my ears while sleeping so when I woke I was in a panic, combing the bed until I found both of them again. I just love them so much. Such a great design."
"I didn‚Äôt necessarily need customer service, but the shop owner still kept in touch with me about the status of my order, which I did appreciate. These are gorgeous. I absolutely *love* them. I have super sensitive ears that experience irritation and/or pain fairly easily and was a little worried that a snug earring would not be possible for me, but I‚Äôve been wearing them since they arrived days ago. I have yet to encounter any problems at all. Very exciting! I will definitely be giving this shop my business again in the future; I‚Äôm delighted with my purchase. Thank you! ü•∞"
"I absolutely LOVE these earrings!! They are not my go to, everyday earrings! Comfy to sleep in too! I added a rubber back to help hold them in and i haven‚Äôt had a single issue! Highly recommend!!"
"I love my ear climbers! They are som comfortable and exactly what I was looking for in my second hole. I used to not be able to wear earrings in the second hole because they would get irritated from the backs. So this solved my problem because there is no ‚Äòback‚Äô, it just slips on and stays put! I keep them in at all times, have had them a month now and haven‚Äôt taken them out once! I do live in USA and because they originate and ship from Spain it did take almost 2 months to get them in. So just a heads up the shipping took quite a long time! But I did eventually receive item and seller was very helpful in making sure they were received."
Love the silver ones and also have the gold. Love dainty earrings like these. Love buy from this group and receive very quick.
"Beautiful! Was looking for a minimalist gold earring but something a bit different than just a plain stud, and these are perfect. Quality feels great, nice gold colour, they are comfy to wear and stay in easily. Will happily buy from this shop again! :)"
Love these earrings. More beautiful then pictured. Arrived very fast and had great communication with Shop. Highly recommend. A+ quality.
I absolutely love my ear crawlers they are adorable and stay put unlike most where you have to keep adjusting and tightening! I‚Äôve received so many compliments! I can‚Äôt wait to get more! I love these earrings so much I would love to help the owner advertise! üòò
"I LOVE these earrings! They shipped and delivered super quick and when I received them I was so happy. The price was great as was the quality. These ear climbers are so cute!! In addition, the shop owner is great. I had a couple questions and they were answered thoroughly and very quickly. I love shopping on etsy and supporting small businesses but I have never had a shop owner that was so quick to answer messages and ship products! Would highly recommend this shop!"
"These are so beautiful! They arrived quickly and are great quality. I was worried that they would be flimsy, but they are not at all."
"Very pretty & just as pictured! I love that you can't even feel them, they are so comfortable! Got lots of compliments. Fast shipping too - thanks!!"
"I was so skeptical to order at first since it had very few reviews but OMG. It‚Äôs GORGEOUS. Honestly, the pictures online don‚Äôt do it justice. It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. The shipping was incredibly fast, even faster than some places here in the states. It‚Äôs the perfect size, it‚Äôs dainty, it‚Äôs GORGEOUS!! Love, love, love!!! Worth every penny. I am SO pleased and happy! I tried to take as many pictures as I could for the review but, again, pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! üòç thank you so much!!! Wish I could leave more pictures!!!"

Arrived beautifully wrapped and very quickly. I've been wearing it ever since I opened the parcel! It's absolutely beautiful. Many thanks!
the ring is so beautiful! it's exactly what I wanted!! thank you so much :)
"Very pretty and dainty. Not overwhelmingly punk but still punk enough if you have to go to work and still want to do you. The ball post studs are shorter than all my other studs, so they do fit a bit snug, so I am using them with my other posts. They look good with everything."
"Absolutely amazing, thank you so much for this beautiful ear studs!!! Regards from Austria ?"
"Slightly smaller than photo and hole was too small for my diamond screwbacks. Seller was very helpful though and made hole larger, but it still didn't fit, so I purchased morganite studs to pair with them instead. It is beautiful and I get lots of compliments."
"Absolutely perfect, love these, they look beautiful!"
Beautiful earrings and lovely quality. Initial order got lost in the post but this was dealt with really quickly by the seller. Would recommend.
"Beautiful earrings, I get so many compliments on them! I have just ordered another pair from you. I loved the free gift, thanks so much x"
These earrings are really beautiful and were worth the wait.
"Beautiful!! The seller was very attentive and fast to respond. They went out of their way to accommodate my custom request. I wanted specific colors, and they created exactly what I wanted. I get so many compliments. I definitely recommend this seller. Customer service is excellent."
Gorgeous earrings with a custom arrangement of stones!
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
"Absolutely love these and get so many compliments about them! They are beautiful and really good quality. Came in the most gorgeous envelope, in a little pouch and with a handwritten note. Incredible! Thank you so much!"
I really love it! For my tiny ears it probably would be better if both arrows were a little bit smaller. The dimensions between lobe holes is perfect but they are a little long for my small ear. But that just means I may need to order more in a custom size üòâ truly love them!
I paid for gift wrap and I was so impressed! My mum loves them and the wrapping. Especially how eco friendly it was! I had to stop her from opening them a day early. Thank you so much. Also your handwriting is beautiful!
Beautiful! I love this and it came in such lovely (recycled/upcycled) packagig so double bonus. I'm sure I'll be back for more.
So perfect. Just the right simple earring for everyday. I‚Äôm glad you was there for me to find. Thank you so much for the perfect earring. Trina
LOVE these earrings ! They are just what I was looking for . Simple and stylish and I can wear them everyday . Took a little longer to ship than expected but definitely worth the wait!
So adorable! Love them!
They are dainty and cute! love them!
These earrings are very cute! I can‚Äôt wait to wear them.
I love these. They look real!

"It's a really cute earring that I wear every day! It also arrived very quickly which is always nice, and the pearls and their colors are so pretty. It was a little bit smaller than I expected but honestly that doesn't really bother me in the slightest! Nice product!"

"Really pleased with my ear climbers - they're beautiful, delicate and a bit different. Easy to put on and they stay in place and feel comfortable to wear. They're lovely quality and I really like that they're made from recycled sterling silver. They also arrived very quickly and were nicely presented. I would definitely buy from Monica again."
Tr√®s tr√®s heureuse de mon achat les boucles sont tr√®s belles et l√©g√®res... Je pense revenir sur votre boutique pour d'autres achats. La livraison √©tait tr√®s rapide et le bijou tr√®s bien emball√©. Merci beaucoup ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
These kinky little beauties are really cute and fit very well in my ear. A definite hit for me. Thanks for such a lovely addition to my growing collection.
These are gorgeous and look fab in my ears. Arrived quickly. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
The belt is beautiful. It looks good with so many different looks. And makes a simple outfit look special.
Something about this cross is just so mysterious. Loving it. Thank you!
"Arriv√©e rapidement, sans aucun probl√®me. Parfaitement conforme √† l‚Äôannonce. C‚Äôest pour un cadeau pour ma s≈ìur, je sais qu‚Äôelle va adorer. Si j‚Äôavais pu j‚Äôen aurai m√™me pris 2 sans h√©siter !"
Tr√®s bel objet! Je l'ai offert √† mon mari qui r√™vait d'avoir une mappemonde. Il l'adore! Merci √† Alexandre d'avoir r√©pondu √† mes interrogations et d'avoir pris soin d'envoyer le cadeau dans les temps et bien prot√©g√©!
These earrings are beautiful! Dainty but well-made. Excellent quality!!
These leaf ear jackets add so much to different post earrings. I love wearing them!
Love them! I bought these for my wedding day and they're perfect!
These are pretty and well made. Unfortunately my ears must be pierced too close to the edge as there is quite a gap between the laurel and my ear which loses some of the effect. There are even two holes on the backing to make it snugger and there is still a gap. I tried rotating the laurel to the side which snuggles it up to the side of my ear but I have to tighten it down so much to keep it in that rotate position that it pinches my ear. If I loosen it to be comfortable in the back it rotates back down and sits well separated from my lobe. I wanted to love these but I think I'll be on the lookout for a girlfriend with larger lobes to gift these beautiful earrings to.
This photo doesn't begin to do this item justice! These earrings are so beautiful! The quality is amazing! From the minute you open the box you are intoxicated and can't stop looking at them! Worth every penny! Now I wish I would have gotten the cuff as well! I love üíò these so much!!!
so beautiful im in love with both pairs of ear climbers. thank u so much I will be ordering from here again! thank u for dealing with me and my crazy ü§™a**..lol
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!
"These are gorgeous! The seller was very helpful and moved the position of the post for me. Shipping was very fast, and these came beautifully packaged in a jewelry box inside a velvet bag. Super happy with my purchases from this seller!"
"These are amazing earrings! Mine are even better looking than the photo! The quality of craftsmanship is excellent, and the style looks great on the ears! These are my favorite jewelry purchase ever, from anywhere, aside from my wedding ring ;)"
Such quick shipping! Love I get to wear such cool earrings on my very sensitive ears! They are soooo well made!
These are so cute! I love them. They are well made and I received compliments :)
These earrings are stunning! I cannot wait to order again from this shop. Beautifully crafted - a true work of art.
"I absolutely love the earrings I ordered, they are very well made and look even more beautiful than the picture."
I liked this pair more than any other pair of earrings and when I finally received the pair I was disappointed. They are much smaller than the picture.
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."
Gorgeous earrings and they look exactly like the photos. I was worried that my ear lobes would be too small but they fit perfectly. Thank you!
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. It‚Äôs such a dainty ring and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it.
LOVE the earrings! I have gotten lots of compliments!
"Great earrings for my daughter. Too small for me, the mom. Can't go with minimal crawler earrings. They have to be wider in order to cover the hole."
"So pretty, right down to the packaging. Fits well and I get so many compliments!"
Bijou superbe ! Merci !
Tr√®s bel article de qualit√© et une vendeuse au top!
super fast shipping for a truly great item. thank you!
Ilona went out of her way to make sure I got exactly what I needed on time for my wedding day. Gorgeous earrings! Incredible customer service.
I loved wearing these incredible earrings. They were incredible quality and matched my dress perfectly. They were incredibly unique and I will be sure to purchase more earrings from this gorgeous shop! Amazing service and brilliant product!
They are absolutely beautiful and it will be a treasure for me to pass along! It‚Äôs the perfect old Hollywood look that I want!
Absolutely gorgeous & exactly what asked for. My order came super fast & was packaged beautifully. Earrings also have clip latch to comfortably hold onto ear without pulling on lobe. Would absolutely order again & refer a friend!
"Nice shade of turquoise-y blue. I've gotten compliments! I like this vendor, too. I had a small problem which they responded to immediately. Nice variety in this shop. I've bought 5 pair at different times, always with best satisfaction."
Love them!
"I got a lot of complements wearing these earring, their textures are so unique that it stands out, so well made, exceeded my expectations. This is a site to keep an out on for new products, love them!!"
The item came damaged and the seller replaced it immediately. Great service and love my earrings!
Really pretty! They look so classy.
"Wow are these gorgeous! I‚Äôm a minimalist and picky about what goes into my closet. I‚Äôve searched for a few years and finally found the perfect piece. They‚Äôre light, well-crafted, extremely stylish. Very happy customer!"
"Yesterday I finally got my earrings and I am delighted that I can finally review it. Everything is great, the earrings are lovely and absolutely unique. Only the shipping is very slow but I guess it is not the fault of the shop. Thank you!!"
"Looks great! Having two at once seems like too much, so my sister and I each have a half and usually pair it with a simple stud on the other ear, if anything. It arrived in California on the faster end of the making+shipping estimation. I'm very pleased with the earrings."
"From the two I ordered, this one is by far my favorite! My very sensitive ear is fine with this silver and it fits perfectly: for the shape of my ear, it's truly ideal. As it fits closely, it doesn't get stuck at all in my long hair. (Please, remember that each ear is unique in shape and no one has the same! ^.^) I've been wearing it all the time (even while sleeping, despite the warning of the seller who advise not to) for the last week and it's really cool. =)"
"Received them a few days ago and have worn them every day! They look amazing, arrived in a beautiful glass pot! They're so cute and definitely worth the wait for them to be shipped to the UK. Extremely tempted to buy some more because I'm head over heels with these earrings! Thank you so much"
Beautiful ear climber and perfect size. I wore this on my wedding day and absolutely love it ! Have had several friends comment on how unique it is and now they want one too. Would defiantly buy again! Very friendly seller and super quick postage. Thanks a Million !
These earrings are great! Simple yet elegant and well made. I am so happy with this purchase!
Love 'em! They met my expectations and I'm so happy I bought them.
"A lovely product, high quality, and a clean and simple design. Great customer service too from Deborah!"
Feathers mean a lot to me personally so they are just so STUNNING!!!! They are the perfect size. Absolutely in love!!! These are by far the most beautiful ever! I love ear climber type earrings they are so unique. These are so pretty and I am just so happy about how they turned out. I cannot thank you enough for these gorgeous earrings. You have a such a beautiful talent and gift! I cannot wait to buy more. You are such an amazing seller! Thank you! I will post pictures later!1
"These silver leaf ear climbers are some of the cutest earrings I have ever seen. They are small and dainty, but seem to be good quality. I love them! They are something that you can wear all the time, dressy or casual. They also are earrings you can sleep in that won‚Äôt poke you behind your ear. Fabulous! I‚Äôm so excited about them. They came so quickly too. I would be happy to order from this shop again. Thanks so much!!"
Very cute and sweet little earrings for any occasion. I've received many compliments on them already. I love them. The shop was great and I received the earrings within a few days. Very quick response and send off. Will definitely check out more from this shop.
Love them!
"These are so pretty!!Very well made.The hammers look is Awsome.I wore them out,and got so many compliments on them.I have two holes in my ears,so I can wear them either in the first..alone or in the second,with gold or diamond earings.Very pleased üòÄ"
"Though I had originally received the smooth climbers, they are just beautiful! She was very attentive to send out the right pair and really looking forward to they."
"these don't really stay in my ears that well, but I think it has to do more with the shape of my ears rather than anything else. They are beautiful quality and they make for a gorgeous, unique ear curation."
Excited for these!
"Arrived in time for my wedding, and they looked glorious! They were a little slower to ship than I'm used to from most shippers. But I won't dock stars for that because she was communicative and honest when I reached out. Plus the earrings are well made and BEAUTIFUL."
"Gorgeous and such a unique piece. I‚Äôll buy again, for sure!"
Great earrings! This earring Jacket also fits with my diamond studs for a really nice twist!
œÄŒøŒªœÖ ŒøŒºŒøœÅœÜŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÜœÑŒπŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒµŒΩŒ±! ŒøœÄœâœÇ Œ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒ≤œâœÇ œÑŒ± œÄŒµœÅŒπŒºŒµŒΩŒ±!!
"Amazing! They are fantastic! Like the photos, but better! Love that it can actually spin."
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"Panagiotis is a skilled artisan and a wonderfully responsive seller. I had a question about the silver used in these earrings and he replied within the hour. I love that these are basically a two-in-one sort of deal - they can be worn as a stud for easy daily use, or with the jacket for a more stand-out look. And the titanium is not irritating at all. I couldn't be more pleased! Thank you very much!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
"The absolute perfect earring for a second or third hole! I have very sensitive ears and the 14k gold has been wonderful since I originally put them in over a week ago. Thank you for the perfect, dainty touch to my ears! Highly recommend supporting this shop and I will be back!"
I love these earrings. They are super cute and well made. They came super fast which was amazing!
"I always get hesitant about buying jewelry online, but this shop owner is amazing. They sent my items right away and the earrings I bought looked amazing. I have super sensitive ears and these earrings have caused me no problems! I am in love with the earrings and the customer service, I will definitely be buying from them again!!"
OMG I LOVE IT. It‚Äôs sooo beautiful and elegant looking. The packaging was adorable and they even gave me a pair of beautiful earrings for free as a thank you! Will definitely be buying from this shop again!!
i‚Äôm in love with my new earings. the quality is solid. they are super light weight which is hard to find in statement jewelry. wonderful customer service. thank you so much:)
"Ladies, I‚Äôm telling you.. the best light weight earrings and gorgeous. It can be complimented as casual and dressy! Best purchase to add to my jewelry wear."
"I love these earrings. I was looking for something like this for a while and I'm really glad I went with these ones. They are really light weight, don't irritate, and are comfortable even though they long. They make a great statement piece and still work if you have additional piercings. Highly recommend the earrings, they came faster than estimated and were beautifully packaged."
"These earrings are BREATHTAKING. The packaging was pristine and super neat, came with a lovely hand written note. The card the earrings are attached to is high quality and beautiful watercolor. I am so happy with this purchase and so excited to wear my new earrings! Thank you so much!!! :) I am so happy to be one of your first dozen orders!"
"Got these as a gift for my sibling‚Äîwho is really artsy and hard to buy for‚Äîand they really liked them! Success! It did take a long time to arrive, but that was expected coming from Israel, and I think they still arrived on time if not earlier than projected."
"beautiful and well made, thank you!"
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. It‚Äôs such a dainty ring and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it.
I originally bought these for my bridesmaids back in 2019 and kept checking back for a year hoping these would come back in stock so I could buy a pair for myself. So thankful they came back and I could get a pair! They are beautiful!!
"Tipp Top, tolle Ware, freundlich, zuverl√§ssig. Immer wieder Gerne. Uneingeschr√§nkt zu empfehlen! Tessek√ºr ederiz"
Bought two pairs of those in size M and XL. Very good quality! Very happy with it and now buying in size L too :) On the photo is XL one.
"the ruby and pink gold ear cuff is really stunning! A little hard getting it in but, once it's in it stays there until you take it off ( which is easy ). Thank you for making such beautiful ear cuff. I have a third one on it's way to me now! Highly recommend!"
Perfect! I love them and the seller was amazing. I will be back! Worth the price and the wait! I will upload pics at a later time but I assure you they are beautiful.
"They are so cool! My second pair from OtisJackson and they are just lovely, the items and the shop!"
They are so nice to wear! You don‚Äôt even notice them! Wonderful!
Love! Exactly as appears in photos. Thanks!
"My granddaughter picked these out for herself, and she is very happy with them. They are dainty, but different! They arrived safely from England and a stop at customs, and were attractively packaged."
Exactly as the foto. I love them!!
Boucles pendantes tr√®s sympas. Un peu longues pour moi mais faciles √† raccourcir.
Yes it shipped on time. Absolutely perfect for the pendants want to wear it with. Love them.
"Comme les bleues, article tr√®s sympa √©galement, boucles √©toiles que j'appr√©cie vraiment. Merci pour votre s√©rieux et votre rapidit√©. Command√© mercredi soir et re√ßu vendredi matin. Je recommande..."
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
. Tr√®s beau travail. Magnifique. Bravo. Tr√®s original et nostalgie assur√©e. üòâ Article conforme. Je recommandeüëçüëç Envoi rapide et soign√©.
"Un cabochon √©tait cass√© suite √† la livraison mais l√† boutique a √©t√© reactive et m'a rembours√©. Je recommande ces supports de cabochon, ils sont vraiment jolis et f√©minin. J'ai h√¢te de les utiliser pour mes prochaines cr√©ations. Merci beaucoup"
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Preciosas! Delicado motivo bot√°nico. Muy favorecedoras. Las compr√© como regalo para mi hija preadolescente y han tenido un gran √©xito :)
"Very happy with my order! The earings are lovely and very good quality. The necklaces are very pretty too, I really love them though I find the chains a little short (especially for the moon necklace which seemed longer on the pictures)."
"These are so pretty and seem like they're good quality! They look great in, and I've gotten tons of compliments. There is another review that rated these as low quality (gave them low stars) because they tried to bend the back hook around to get them into their ears. However I don't think the back is made to do this - I fan-angle them around a bit to get them in my ear and into place without bending the back hook, which is completely possible, it just takes a couple seconds. I love these and would highly recommend them."
I've been looking for Laurel leaf styled earrings for the longest time and these are exactly what I wanted! The design is small but detailed and beautifully made. The back is sturdy too - they were comfortable to wear all week and I never felt like they would fall off. Definitely a favourite!
I love them so much so beautiful and was delivered very quickly would totally buy again
I love these.They fit great.
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
"These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)"
Tr√®s beau bracelet que je vais offrir √† mon conjoint pour No√´l ! Je pense qu'il lui plaira !
"Merci pour l'envoi attentionn√©, mon amie adore votre broche"

These were EXACTLY what I wanted and came in the most gorgeous packaging ever. I have actually kept it and will re-use it. Will definitely buy again. Thanks SilvaNova.
Love them & easy to put in. I will be getting some more really soon for the second holes in my lobes!
Love these earrings. Have now got 5! thank you for quick delivery and I love the packaging. Will be back looking for more soon! C
"Quick delivery, super-cute packaging and great earrings. Really happy and will definitely buy from SilvaNova again!"
I love these earrings. They can be dressed up or dressed down with a pair of jeans. They are great. Shipping was held up because of holidays but I was compensated with a lovely gift. Thank you.
Superbes boucles d'oreille et envoi rapide
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
Exquisitely delicate well made item to be worn with my illusion pearl choker to my daughters wedding in July! Love these immensely!
Absolutely gorgeous! I am over the moon with these earrings. They arrived super early too. Would definitely use DArgentMinimaliste again!
"Wonderfull!! I am so happy with my new earrings, they are exactly as described. They are delicate and beautiful and the closing mechanism is invisible. Super :)"
"Lovely item, looks so pretty, only problem was I didn't get to wear them, daughter loved them so much they went into her ears ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Great earrings... arrived in great time considering they were coming from italy. People comment on them whenever i wear them.
"These are so cool! Thanks! The shipping time was ok for the distance, the transaction was smooth and pleasant."
Really love these earrings - so unusual. Only issue - they're quite hard to do up. Bit fiddly to get the post through the back part of the earring and line it up with the front. Otherwise - I love them!
"These earrings are super cool and quirky, love them!"
I love the style of these earrings with the jacket! Shipped quickly too!
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©"
"Tipp Top, tolle Ware, freundlich, zuverl√§ssig. Immer wieder Gerne. Uneingeschr√§nkt zu empfehlen! Tessek√ºr ederiz"
Bought two pairs of those in size M and XL. Very good quality! Very happy with it and now buying in size L too :) On the photo is XL one.

Perfect! I love them and the seller was amazing. I will be back! Worth the price and the wait! I will upload pics at a later time but I assure you they are beautiful.
"I tried to take a picture that shows what the earrings look like in and out. These are awesome! They're super comfy and easy to put in and take off. I even where them to bed and working out. They do take a while from order time to arrival, which is definitely to be expected of such high-quality handmade pieces. Not a criticism! Just something to consider when figuring out when to purchase :)"
I have very sensitive ears and the titanium option does not make my ears itchy! They are very comfortable. Can see myself wearing these to bed. Delivery was a bit on the longer side... BUT I am Canadian. They did have to travel quite a bit üòä. The titanium ones have a bit of a duller finish to them. Would go with another material is you prefer shiny. I might end up having to buy them in white gold too hehehe.
"Like someone else mentioned, I didn't know exactly what I was ordering but I LOVE these earrings. There's no back on them. It just twists through and you can't even feel that you're wearing them. And they look unique and very cute. Nice design! Received 2 weeks from order date."
I am in love with these! So unique and beautiful. I just received silver today and I am ordering gold today as well! LUV them!
"So happy I purchased these!!! I'd been in search for wedding earrings for a while and kept coming back to these. I finally purchased them, a little late so I had to express ship them but the seller was very friendly and helpful and the earrings are BEAUTIFUL. 10/10 recommend!"
"Th√© earings are very beautiful and Dana very Kind good service. Th√© only fact is to be carefull with custom device because i live In europe, i had to pay 30 euros more. Thank you for you good customer service."
gorgeous. made it just in time to USA. quality superb.
I love these guys soo much!! They‚Äôre so much lighter than I was expecting which is wonderful. The most perfect little unique touch for my ears. Thank you!!
Love them!!! Thank you!
I bought these beautiful earrings for myself and really love them. They are not only gorgeous but also very light and comfortable to wear. 100% happy with them!
Some of the most unique and most complimented earrings I have ever worn.
"Beautifully crafted and packaged, as usual! I love how adding these ear jackets completely changes the look of any stud earrings you have. Such a smart idea, and so pretty! Highly recommended!"
"Super cute earrings, lightning fast shipping. The packaging is one of the best I've seen from etsy shops. Highly recommended!"
Beautiful earrings. I always get tons of compliments when I wear them! I love how customizable ear jackets are.
"Love these! They add a subtle something extra to any pair of studs, and they're well-made."
"Absolutely gorgeous earrings and super fun to wear! Seller was super friendly and made my original character so tiny and perfect! The details are incredible and very light weight, yet also very durable! Also the perfect size for my ears as I don't like chunky, hefty earrings, so I'd say they're just right. I'd give more stars if I could and I'll definitely be back for more! :)"
"Absolutely adorable. The backs aren‚Äôt quite the tightest grip, so they can be a bit loose, but it‚Äôs manageable once they‚Äôre actually in your ears. Love love love the design!"
Love these! I sent her numerous photos of my Dalmatian and she did a wonderful job with my dogs most unique spots! These are smaller than I anticipated but that's not a bad thing. 10/10 would buy again. The order was completed very quickly and arrived with a bunch of awesome Australian stamps on the package.
"These are seriously the cutest things ever! They're also beautifully well made with so much detail and care, I was blown away by how gorgeous these are. I asked for these as a custom pair, and Jessica was a delight to talk with through the process. I will definately be ordering more of these, this lady is an incredibly talented artist, and I'm very proud to be able to wear her designs."
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
Commande re√ßue dans les d√©lais. Tr√®s contente de mon achat. Fait avec beaucoup de minutie.
Tr√®s jolie bracelet les couleurs sont superbes
"Arrived very quickly and it absolutely lovely! I really, really love mine. They're very well made and don't fall out."
The earrings are great. My daughter loves them.
"LOVE the earrings! No reaction at all, i have sensitive ears. I‚Äôve seen some reviews saying the backs of the earrings are longer than expected, but that‚Äôs not my experience at all. Perfect length & don‚Äôt poke me in my sleep. Beautiful, simple set. Very fast shipping too!"
"The order was filled quickly and arrived exactly as the picture shows it to be. The customer service, when I asked about shipping was quick, kind, and helpful. I will say take care to measure your neck- it can be easy to misjudge where something will sit- but the length I ordered was exactly what I wanted for my friend who loves choker style necklaces. It's beautiful and Exactly what I wanted."
"Just Lovely! These earrings are everything I look for in good quality sterling silver jewelry: beautiful, unique design; impeccable craftsmanship: discernible quality; great value for the price; and appropriate ‚Äúheft.‚Äù By that last one I mean that, unlike some of today‚Äôs hollowed out sterling, these feel and look solid and luxe. They make a statement with the design, but also are dainty. It‚Äôs also a solid investment because you get AT LEAST two pairs of earrings (posts alone, posts with the jacket. The posts and jacket also can be combined with other elements I have in my jewelry collection for numerous additional looks. Heading over to this shop to find more great items. To top it all off, the earrings arrived in just a few days... SO SPECIAL! THANK YOU!"
I think these earrings are very Nice! The Turquoise is Bright! Very nicely made. It's an added bonus that it can be worn with just the one Turquoise piece! I wore it in my second hole! Looks nice that way too!
love these! love that I can wear just the posts too. 2 in 1!
"I‚Äôm so happy with how my earrings fit, they are such a fun little pair. I can wear them as studs, or with the back piece attached, either way I can see these a newfound favorite for my jewelry box. I have never seen this style of earrings before, it feels like they are that little bit of something extra special for daily wear. Highly recommend!"
super cute fast delivery thank you !!
super cute fast delivery thank you !!
"Parfait pour les trois ras de cou merci beaucoup, et re√ßus tr√®s rapidement en plus !"

"L√©g√®res, simples et √©l√©gantes, ces boucles d‚Äôoreilles se portent en toutes occasions. Je les adore! Depuis que je les ai, je ne les quitte plus. Et comme toujours, livraison rapide et soign√©e. Merci Laura."
Bravo pour toutes ces belles cr√©ations simples et raffin√©es. C'est si inspirant! et merci pour le suivit. mes boucles d'oreilles Endless me ravissent...
"I loved all Laura's unique designs but I had to choose one so I bought these minimalist earrings for my girlfriend as a gift and she liked them very much. Besides, Laura was very kind following the order by msgs until received."
"Tr√®s belles cr√©oles, originales et minimalistes ; je les aime beaucoup tout comme mon entourage ! Livraison tr√®s rapide et d√©licate attention √† la r√©ception de la part de Laura ! Seul petit b√©mol avec l'attache qui se d√©fait facilement. J'avais perdu une boucle alors que je marchais dans la rue car elle avait d√ª se prendre dans mes cheveux (j'imagine). Depuis, je les porte toujours avec des attaches en plastique que j'ai rajout√© ! En dehors de √ßa, au top ! Je les adore ! Merci Laura !"
"already obsessed, so minimal and unique. arrived pretty quickly also! thank you so much, beautiful piece ‚ô•Ô∏è"
They are beautiful !!!!
The circle part is bigger then I expected but I still like them. Definitely a conversation piece. They also arrived way before the estimated delivery date.
"I love these earrings! High quality, very unique. I have received many compliments on them."
"I was so skeptical to order at first since it had very few reviews but OMG. It‚Äôs GORGEOUS. Honestly, the pictures online don‚Äôt do it justice. It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. The shipping was incredibly fast, even faster than some places here in the states. It‚Äôs the perfect size, it‚Äôs dainty, it‚Äôs GORGEOUS!! Love, love, love!!! Worth every penny. I am SO pleased and happy! I tried to take as many pictures as I could for the review but, again, pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! üòç thank you so much!!! Wish I could leave more pictures!!!"

Arrived beautifully wrapped and very quickly. I've been wearing it ever since I opened the parcel! It's absolutely beautiful. Many thanks!
the ring is so beautiful! it's exactly what I wanted!! thank you so much :)
"So my style. Edgy, yet minimalist chic and elegant. I honestly think these are my dream earrings. These were shipped the day after the order; thankfully the swift travel from Valencia to NYC only took a week! (I am in gratitude of Ohana, the postal services, and lucky stars.) Anyway. Tremendous thanks for such professionalism and talent in sharing SUCH an insanely beautiful piece. Xoxo."
I am in love with these earrings. I get so many compliments. I plan on buying more!
Fast shipping to Australia. Great quality. Previously bought these in rose gold and loved them so much I needed them in silver :P Love!
I received my silver spike earring jackets today and I love them! They are of beautifully crafted quality and my lobes fit perfectly in the hole furthest away from the spikes. Thank you so much for a great buying experience. I'll be back to buy more :)
"Oof, I love this earring. I had it in my wishlist for so long and I am very happy that I finally got it. Things to know, the metal is extremely thin and easily bendable. To me, this is a good thing. What I didn't notice from the pictures is that the lobe portion pushes your lobe forward a bit and can look a little unflattering, but it is easy to ever so slightly bend the metal where it needs to go. I also have extremely hard cartilage that gets irritated easily so I was able to make the curve in the top a little wider to accommodate my ear. Last thing to know if it is not wide earphone friendly. The earring will hit the pause button on my raycons, haha! Again, not much of an issue, I just adjust it and I'm good. I've worn them all day (paired with the threader long threader earring to make that asymmetrical look)."
"I wasn't sure how I would like this, but I am not exaggerating when I say I love this earring so much!!! I am a lazy person when it comes to jewelry and always prefer to keep earrings in, then forget about them. While I can't, and definitely wouldn't recommend sleeping with it on, it is always immediately back in my ear once I wake up. I can't recommend this shop/earring enough! Love it!"
This is my first time seeing earrings that look like this and it looks amazing! It's such a unique look! I'm definitely going to buy more of this style of earring
I love this piece of jewelry it‚Äôs unique and gets a lot of attentionüôÇ the first couple times I wore it I realize that I have to keep an eye on it when dawning my Covid mask. I found when I took my mask from around my ear I saw the earring on the ground so I hv to remain conscious that its there - its so light weighted! I just got to be careful n touch my ear now n then to make sure it‚Äôs still there! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too big I did get the large I think the small might be too small but I think I would have the same issue but I love it! thank you. Customer support was great because I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to get the large or the small and I measured my ear as instructed and was advised on the large. A Beautiful piece of jewelryüôÇ
We are a shop based on Paraguay and absolutely love maya Valentino jewelry!! They have the best customer service and great quality!! Thank you üôèüèª
"Best customer service ever and best birthday gift! I had a small issue with the shipment and the owner contacted me immediately, was super reasonable and we fixed the problem in less than 10 minutes. I 100% recommend! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Gorgeous earring!!! great design, and excellent customer service!"
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
"Pierre vraiment plus claire et plus ""fade"" que sur la photo"
Tr√®s jolies boucles. Bonne qualit√©. Bon rapport qualit√© prix Je suis ravie. Merci üôÇ
"These pink jade pierced earrings are pretty, but a lighter pink color than shown on my computer. They are a soft pink, not a bright pink. The earrings are well-made, safely packaged, and timely shipped. Thank you."
I just received this today and it is such a beautiful piece!!! I really love it. The shipping was really fast too. Thank you so much!
Lovely earrings! Great buying experience...

"Bonjour, Je souhaitais revenir sur cette premi√®re commande pour vous faire part de ma satisfaction. En effet, command√© pendant la p√©riode des f√™tes de fin d'ann√©e, j'ai eu la tr√®s agr√©able surprise de recevoir ces BO dans les meilleurs d√©lais (moins de 3 jours !) avec toute le s√©rieux dont est capable ""Flaure"" : ponctualit√©, emballage +++, petit mot plein d'attentions et enfin le magnifique article : encore plus joli ""en vrai"" !!!

These earrings are even better in person!!! They are adorable and unusual - I've worn them multiple times already and are one of my very favorites!
"Je poursuis mon commentaire qui tient compte de la paire de BO pr√©c√©dentes (BO coeur argent√©)... En tout point, et comme d'habitude avec La Boutique de Flaure, les cr√©ations sont fid√®les aux photos et m√™me plus jolies encore !

Shipping was delayed due to Covid and the seller went above and beyond to let me know. Jewelry looks a little smaller in person but is delicate and dainty. I get so many compliments when I wear them.
"These are beautiful. I love jewelry that is just a little different so these fish are great. The one gold one in with all the silver, so unique. Worth the wait (about a month) to get them from Germany"
"I love these earrings! Because of the climber design, I can wear them 24/7, even during sleep without getting poked. I also appreciate the mixed metals so I can pair with gold or silver."
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE these rings!!! It couldn‚Äôt have fit my existing ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù wedding band set anymore perfect!!! I also received earrings which are adorable as well!!! I may have to add to my collection now! Thank you!!!!
"Absolutely love them. They bend quite easily to make them fit your ear, and I don't think I've quite figured it out (maybe my ears are just very thick hahaha) but they look lovely!!!!"
My first wearing was to a wedding where i recieved loads of great comments.
"GORGEOUS! LOVE these earrings! They are so easy to insert and very, very comfortable to wear. The craftsmanship is outstanding! They came nicely packaged with fast delivery. Thank you so very, very much! üíúü•∞üíú"
"Beautiful, really pleased with these. Really well made, well packaged and very lovely indeed. Tip: I would advise slipping on a small rubber back as they can slide out quite easily."
Just received this item today. Absolutely love love love these beautiful earrings. The packaging was quite lovely as well. Adorable pouch for the earrings and the screw on back of cuff is so comfortable. I am a new satisfied customer and will certainly be ordering again soon! I double the 5 star rating and give a 10.
"I ordered the emerald green crawlers earrings for my wedding day. They are stunning!! The seller also enclosed a pair of emerald green studs per my request, I cant praise them enough. Awesome shop!! I can‚Äôt wait to wear them in December."
"These earrings are STUNNING! Gold posts for my very sensitive ears, and they are SO comfortable. Fast shipping, wonderful communication....these will be perfect for my wedding. So happy with my purchase!"
Can‚Äôt wait to wear these at my wedding. I was Hoping I could get it custom to include the pink stud instead of emerald but they went out of their way to include the pink studs! Excellent product and customer service. Will order again
My first climber earrings..... the pearls are dainty and look fine... am receiving compliments! Thankyou Charlie.
These ear climbers are really beautiful and they‚Äôre of good quality. Would deffo recommend this brand!
"Beautiful delicate climbers, light weight so don't feel like they will slip and exactly as described. Great communication too!"
"Very elegant and pretty, can wear for work or date night."
"Nice, sturdy clasp, looking forward to having it on my omega necklace. Haven‚Äôt been able to wear both sides of chain because the old clasp was a standard type that did not accommodate the white vs yellow gold chain sides. Fast shipping, very responsive to questions and very accommodating! Thank you Christine for the service and quality merchandise too. All future needs will bring me back here before I look elsewhere. By the way, my jeweler wanted to sock it to me and charge me $168 for the same clasp. I‚Äôve had this chain for so long now that the clasp would have been more than I paid for the chain over 15 years ago. Trustworthy seller, if unsure, please reconsider, I have no regrets!"
"I liked the pendant and even though I measured what size it would be, it just seemed too small for my liking once I got it. That‚Äôs my fault! I decided to return it and the seller was awesome."
I‚Äôve waited so long for a Star of David Cross!! I already had the 14k gold ball chain to match with it! This piece holds a lot of personal meaning for me and the rose gold cross in the middle pick up the rose gold rose flower in my other piece. It brings everything together!
everyone comments on this beautiful piece. I make pendants and with the charm hold can change my necklace at will
Livraison rapide. Tr√®s joli snood que j‚Äôai achet√© pour ma fille. H√¢te qu‚Äôelle le porte cet hiver. Je recommande !
"tr√®s jolies boucles, elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite merci beaucoup !"
Perfect for my little toddler
"Tout √† fait conforme √† la photo, bonne taille, beau mod√®le : je suis tr√®s satisfaite !!"
"Stunning earrings! Absolutely love them. Very thoughtful to include instructions on how to put them in, as that first time is a bit like a puzzle. Fast delivery to. Would definitely recommend."
Love these earrings! This is the second pair I've bought (I stupidly lost one of the first set) and Deborah was very helpful and lovely to talk to. Would 100% recommend the product and seller. x
"Lovely ear climbers, beautifully packaged. Very happy with my purchase."
Love these earrings! So beautiful!
"Der climber ist toll, so wie im FOTO."
"FYI, these are sold individually, but is beautiful."
"I actually ordered these for myself as a gift after my furbaby crossed the rainbow bridge. They are so delicate and beautiful. They look like they'd cost much, much more than they do. I'm absolutely in love!"
"The earrings are beautiful and feel sturdy enough for daily wear. They are a smidgeon smaller than I anticipated (they're not easily visible on my chubby earlobe), but they are wonderful and comfortable. Also, the shipping was super fast, the package was smartly and safely packed, and arrived in perfect condition."
These are dainty which is what I was looking for. I love big bold earrings but my bestie's twins will wreak havoc on my ears with them. So I had to look for baby safe earrings that were still bold. Fast shipping and the packaging was minimal but beautiful.
"I love these climbers! I immediately put on and admired myself in the mirror üòÇ I also ordered some opal earrings, both pair are absolutely adorable! Thanks bunches! üåª"
The rose gold color is beautiful and it is very eye-catching and unique. The right earring was a little tight but I think I can bend it a bit and it will be fine. Love that it's comfortable enough to sleep in and doesn't irritate at all. Thanks again!
"Had these earrings for a few months now, and I am in love with them!!! I get compliments constantly. I have an issue wearing any other metal in my ears other than titanium, and I can't find pretty titanium earrings anywhere else. These are perfect! I have them in 24/7 and have no issues. Will definitely be purchasing more!"
Magnifique!
Love the material and design of this item! I've also gotten many compliments on its unique design - it looks and feels high-quality. One thing I wasn't expecting was the thick gauge of the earring. It hurt my ear slightly and it'll take time for my ear to stretch out.
This is so pretty! The earring fits perfectly in my tragus and the flat back is easy to put it and remove. I requested a custom length and Rosec Jewels was able to accommodate. Very happy with the purchase!
"This was my first purchase from Rosec but I am sure to be a customer for life! Very happy with the single earring I ordered for my conch. Construction is pleasantly sturdy for such a small piece, and with a fully threaded post I am confident in its security and how well it will stay in my ear. Shipping was unbelievably fast and I‚Äôm already in love."
Purchased 2 different earrings as shown on photo. Dainty but sparkly with a secure back fastening. Looks beautiful on the lobe or on the helix. Good communication from seller and well package for transportation. Comes with certificate. Would purchase again.
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
They are gorgeous.
"They were so beautiful for my graduation, I got so many compliments. I thought it would be uncomfortable with the thought of chain going through my ear but it was so easy and it glided through, I love them and are definitely one of my staple earrings."
"Amazing! I love it! I got the 40cm and wasn't expecting it to sit so high up on my neck (something to consider), I have grown to really love it & the seller offered to swap it straight away if I wasn't happy - she's so lovely!"
"I had been looking for a gold chain for ages and when I found it here I was so excited. Such a reasonable price and when it arrived I was so happy with the quality and it came in the cutest packaging! I have since bought another chain, the oval hoops, the circle huggies and the LEO pendant necklace. I honestly get so many compliments about my jewellery now and I genuinely can't stop telling my friends about it!"
"Lovely hoops for my first of two lower lobe piercings in each ear. Bought an extra one for my helix piercing but didn‚Äôt realise I needed a different gauge! Luckily, my friend wanted a new hoop for her nose piercing and this was a perfect fit for that. The 7mm were ideal for the second of my lower lobe piercings. Very neat and simple design, exactly what I was after."
"Originally I bought rose gold filled 18g, 7mm for my tragus piercing, however I must have a narrow piercing as it wouldn‚Äôt fit. After speaking to Mary from Altered Elegance, I was advised to order the 20g, 7mm and it fits perfectly. Excellent customer service and really lovely earrings. Would highly recommend. Christine"
Such a gorgeous and unusual piece of jewellery! I have had so many compliments about it. Its easy to adjust and very comfortable to wear. I really love it - thank you!
I‚Äôve ordered SO many small hoops for my nose ring and tragus on Etsy. These hoops are the best quality by FAR! After twisting them open to put in these actually twisted right back into place perfectly which never happens. The gold is shiny & smooth - just so beautiful!
Received on time and very nicely packaged. These earrings are even prettier and more delicate than I thought they'd be. A very good surprise. Thank you!
"Earrings lovely and beautifully wrapped! Arrived on time, very pleased would use this company again."
Still not received the earrings. Please check if they are truly dispatched or sat somewhere in your shop!
"My friend absolutely loved the earrings! It was sparkly and enough of a statement for a night outfit, but also can be casual with a simple outfit in the day. The colour is absolutely gorgeous too!! (Got the blue butterfly) The size was also ideal (around 4cmx1cm) The delivery came later than expected but it might be due to covid."
These are so comfy I don't even know I'm wearing them. Love them and they shipped quickly and were package very nicely. Thank you
Very unique and beautiful earrings.
Love love love these earrings! Beautifully made good quality. I wear mine as a climber and it looks great.
Absolutely LOVE this ear crawler! It‚Äôs very delicate and pretty!
Love these ear climbers!
"Beautiful packaging, absolutely lovely quality. Enjoy it very much I've gotten so many compliments. Thank you!"
looks great! I love these :)
in love with these üòç
"I love my new earrings ! Very original, and didn't look as big as in the picture on my ear (for the best actually). I ordered 2 pairs so it took 2 weeks production + 2 weeks shipping."
I absolutely love my dragonfly ear rings. Such a simple and elegant design. So pretty!! Thanks Ara
These are even more beautiful in person. I love them. Delicately designed but sturdy in my ears. Lots of compliments! I look forward to seeing more of her designs.
Eye catching earrings! Get lots of compliments. Plus Kalypso is so friendly and helpful.
original !!! bon site et envoi soign√©
Beautiful earrings. I do know now I need to go with wider crawler earrings in order to cover the hole properly.
"beautiful earrings, quick shipping, very happy with them!"
"Arrived in just 6 days, is exactly as pictured & looks so pretty on my ear lobe! Short enough to wear in either my 1st or 2nd hole (also bought the stars one which is longer). Would reccomend this shop for sure! Cheap jewelry that does not look cheap.üëçüåø"
I ordered the stars and leaf crawler earrings. They are awesome!! And they came in super fast. I highly recommend.
"These are so pretty and dainty, exactly as described and arrived quickly! They‚Äôre moldeable and stay in place all day. Very happy with this purchase!"
"They're beautiful! They came SO quickly, and they look exactly as they do in the photo. They'll be perfect for my Bridesmaids!"
"I really love these earrings,they are just amazing! I have had them coloured in a galaxy which are deep blue,purple,pink,with a hint of violet. My favourite range of colours. Everyone has noticed them and thought how unusual and eye catching they are. I've worn them in 4 different ways so far,I love clothes and accessories that you can change and manipulate to create a different look,like these ear climbers. The packaging was beautifully presented,which showed how caring and creative this seller really is. I have ordered another set of ear climbers which I'm looking forward to receiving soonüòÄ Thank you so much Panagiotis you are quite an artistüòò xxxxx"
I just love these earrings. Quality is extremely solid. Easy to put on. Everyone gives me compliments when I wear them. I love the bright color.
I love these earrings! Arrived quickly to the UK. A great size

Tr√®s beau bracelet que je vais offrir √† mon conjoint pour No√´l ! Je pense qu'il lui plaira !
"Merci pour l'envoi attentionn√©, mon amie adore votre broche"
Todo perfecto. Muy contento con la comprea.
"I already got so many compliments on these earrings, people have to look twice. Great shop, top quality!"
Thank you i love it üòç
They are amazing!!! Comfortable and look fabulous!!!
"What a cool versatile piece of jewelry. It can be worn in many different ways and has a very stylish look to them. Bought them for my wife on Valentines day, she loved them."
Tr√®s jolies !! Merci beaucoup !
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
SO unusual. Get tons of compliments. And came so quick! All the way from Greece.
"Super fast shipping, very solid piece! Absolutely love it!"
I LOVE these ear jackets. Super chic. VERY wearable. Beautifully made. Came in good time and in a lovely well dressed box. Stunning.
GORGEOUS earrings! I love them!!
LOVE THEM! Super shiny and cute x
Absolutely love them! My new staple earrings.
"Love it! Looks really great and are comfortable to wear. Fast delivery as well. Thanks, will order again."
*UPDATE* these earrings were so loose on the backing eventually they fell off one day and one earring was lost entirely. These earrings are unique and good quality - the post fits a *little* loosely into the back so I‚Äôm a bit nervous the earring might fall out on the move but so far so good!
"I love these earrings. Just what I wanted. Dainty, but not too small. The perfect size. I was happy I purchased both left and right. Fast shipping too. I will keep this shop in favorites!"
"Beautiful piece! Diamonds really shine. Not very comfortable to sleep in, but amazing quality!"
"Beautiful!,,"
They don't stay up on the ear. Very disappointing since they were a birthday gift from my husband.
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
Commande re√ßue dans les d√©lais. Tr√®s contente de mon achat. Fait avec beaucoup de minutie.
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them. Shipping was super fast by the way, well impressed! I highly recommend getting something from UrbanRaven, you can tell she makes her jewellery with a lot of love. :)"
"Even more beautiful in person! This is a gift for my mother's birthday, and I wouldn't have bought a special gift from anyone else. Everything is top quality, unique, and we'll made. This is my jewelry store!"
super cute fast delivery thank you !!
super cute fast delivery thank you !!
"Parfait pour les trois ras de cou merci beaucoup, et re√ßus tr√®s rapidement en plus !"
Ravie tr√®s jolie dentelle. J‚Äôadore merci
"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL earrings! I was looking for something unique, something not overwhelming, simple, goes with everything.... and these fit the bill. I also appreciated the backs that came with them. Those were unexpected. Great turnaround on the shipping, too!"
"Very cute, love the way they look- modern but elegant. Lovely presented packaging, fun to get in the mail, fast turnaround!"
"Dainty, unique and lovely! And I love how you color-coded the different boxes with the different ribbons so that I know what is in each box without me having to open them all, thank you!"
"Love these earrings! They are such a nice shape, and an easy everyday piece."
"My sister loves them. Very fast shipping, great customer service."
"This is the 2nd one of these I've bought from this seller I love this one because it fits my ear well. I dont have a lot of room along the outside edge of my ear, but the shape of this crawler is small enough to fit. Very cute and pretty, thank you!!"
I LOVE these earrings!! They are my new favorites and the compliments I get on these are amazing. The stones are beautiful and match wonderfully. The craftsmanship is lovely and the attention to detail is obvious. They arrived quickly and the seller was great.
"Ear crawlers are hard for me to wear because I don't have a lot of ear along the outside edge where the crawler should lay. This crawler works well though because I can bend the end of the scroll design in just a little so that it keeps the top end of the crawler more secure on my ear. Very pretty too, thanks!!!!!"
"Beautiful! The delivery took longer than expected but not by much, especially given that it‚Äôs COVID times. Great quality and look better that in pictures. I‚Äôve already worn them multiple times. Thank you!"
Super pretty! Picture doesn‚Äôt do just to how stunning these are
Elegant and sparkly! Adds instant subtle attraction and is not too over the top. I love the jacket type and this is the first of many!
My earrings arrived very quickly and in good condition. I absolutely love these earrings - so pretty and sparkly. The quality is great and they are now my new favorite earrings!
"Li adoro! Avevo gi√† un paio di orecchini di Valentina (Sherlock e Watson), ma mentre ordinavo quelli di David Bowie ho visto questi e non ho potuto resistere! In pi√π lei √® stata gentilissima, e ha posposto la datta della spedizione al mio ritorno dalle ferie, come richiesto :) Grazie ancora Valentina, sono stupendi!"
"I ADORE these earrings. Wore them at RDC2, and lots of people saw them and loved them too <3"
"Fatti benissimo, precisi e indentici alla fotografia! Prezzo ragionevole per la qualit√† proposta, adorabili e per nulla pacchiani! Spedizione rapida e venditrice molto gentile. Consiglio assolutamente a tutti <3 http://i66.tinypic.com/245hwt2.jpg"
Bonjour de France ! Excellent etsy-er !!! Many thanks !!! I am very happy to trade again ;) The earrings are wonderful !!!
"Wow, I have always had positive experiences on etsy but this had been the best yet. Macalania was so quick to ship my order out, and the earrings I recieved are exactly what I hoped for! I didn't expect the additional backs, but really appreciate them. I'm always losing earring backs. Thank you so much, I'll definitely be a return customerüòÅ"
"Amazing quality, beautiful packaging. Very fast shipping. Thank you for the extra backs too! I have them to my Mom for her birthday and she was over the moon for them!"
"Gifted these to my sister and we, both, love them! Arrived in a perfect little gift box w/protective bag included for storing, plus extra earring backs. The ""hugs&kisses"" are such a cute idea! Thanks so much!!!"
Beautiful. Seems to be pretty well made. I didn't realize the earrings were actually 3 separate pieces but nonetheless GREAT. They come with different types of backs so you can use the ones that feel the most secure.
Love these climber earrings! Will purchase more. Great quality and shipped as promised. They actually stay put on my ears! lots of compliments!
These Earclimbers are beautiful made! Unfortunately they slip from my ears. Fast shipment.
First time I wore them I got so many compliments! Fast shipping!
Love these sterling silver leaf climber earrings as they enhance every earring I wear them with. Arrived quickly and the seller is very easy to work with as well.
"tr√®s jolies boucles, elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite merci beaucoup !"
Livraison rapide. Tr√®s joli snood que j‚Äôai achet√© pour ma fille. H√¢te qu‚Äôelle le porte cet hiver. Je recommande !
"Tout √† fait conforme √† la photo, bonne taille, beau mod√®le : je suis tr√®s satisfaite !!"
Je suis ravie ! Tr?s jolie trousse et livraison tr?s rapide ! Merci
"I am very happy! I bought these because they are climbers, and I wanted to use them to hide my second lobe piercing. (The second ones was- regrettably- not done professionally and ended up leaving lopsided scarring) they hide the scars very well. And on the plus side they are inexpensive and unique! The shipping took a bit longer then I was expecting but they were worth the wait!"
I had a great experience with HarshandSweet. The items I received were as expected and even better. These ear climbers are absolutely adorable and the one thing I was most impressed with was that they stay in place so much better than others I've purchased. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend them.
"Super sch√∂ne Ohrringe! Schneller Versand und liebevoll verpackt! Vielen Dank, ich bin begeistert! üíï"
Beautiful and sterling silver - my favorite. Great price; high quality.
"I love these earrings. Just what I wanted. Dainty, but not too small. The perfect size. I was happy I purchased both left and right. Fast shipping too. I will keep this shop in favorites!"
"Beautiful piece! Diamonds really shine. Not very comfortable to sleep in, but amazing quality!"
"Beautiful!,,"
They don't stay up on the ear. Very disappointing since they were a birthday gift from my husband.
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
I purchased these ear climbers for my daughter as a gift. She loved them. They are beautiful and unique. I hesitated about ordering internationally but decided to take the chance considering they were my favorite when compared to many others listed. Maytal was in close contact with me throughout the shipping process with delays as expected due to the pandemic. Her customer service and concern were superb...she updated me frequently until they arrived at my post office. I would not hesitate in ordering from her in the future.
"I was so excited when they came! I love how they look on my ears - the pic doesn't do them justice. Very comfortable to wear, too; it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing earrings."
"Absolutely beautiful! I've gotten so many compliments on them. Even better, my sensitive ears are also loving them! üòç"
"These dainty, beautiful leaf crawlers are absolutely stunning. They are perfect for my bridesmaids, I even bought an extra for myself because I know I‚Äôll wear them outside of my wedding day. I had excellent customer service! There were only 3 pairs of the specific earrings that I wanted left and when I asked her if there were anymore she said she was making more that week and they could be shipped out the following week! I love them and they came in a cute package for the girls to open! :)"
"Beautiful! I bought these for my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day, and I think that she will love them! The rose gold and purple look great together. The Shipping was exceptionally fast, and the packaging is very nice as well. Love supporting small businesses from Washington state! Thank you!"
They are beautiful in person! Just what I was looking for a dainty ear climber. I love them
I've never used Ear Climber Earrings before. But I absolutely love these. The are dainty and perfect for my big day. Thank you!
"Seller has excellent communication, and the shipping was VERY quick THANK YOU!!!!!! Earrings are super dainty and the perfect size to appear classy. They're a bit sparklier in the photo than in person, but very pretty."
Dainty crawler good for everyday wear. Rose gold is subtle and adds a bit of color to contest the stones. Good experience with seller responding to messages with shipping issues. Highly recommend!
"Wow, I have always had positive experiences on etsy but this had been the best yet. Macalania was so quick to ship my order out, and the earrings I recieved are exactly what I hoped for!

Beautiful. Seems to be pretty well made. I didn't realize the earrings were actually 3 separate pieces but nonetheless GREAT. They come with different types of backs so you can use the ones that feel the most secure.
"I am very happy! I bought these because they are climbers, and I wanted to use them to hide my second lobe piercing. (The second ones was- regrettably- not done professionally and ended up leaving lopsided scarring) they hide the scars very well. And on the plus side they are inexpensive and unique! The shipping took a bit longer then I was expecting but they were worth the wait!"
I had a great experience with HarshandSweet. The items I received were as expected and even better. These ear climbers are absolutely adorable and the one thing I was most impressed with was that they stay in place so much better than others I've purchased. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend them.
"Super sch√∂ne Ohrringe! Schneller Versand und liebevoll verpackt! Vielen Dank, ich bin begeistert! üíï"
Beautiful and sterling silver - my favorite. Great price; high quality.
"tr√®s jolies boucles, elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite merci beaucoup !"
Livraison rapide. Tr√®s joli snood que j‚Äôai achet√© pour ma fille. H√¢te qu‚Äôelle le porte cet hiver. Je recommande !
"Tout √† fait conforme √† la photo, bonne taille, beau mod√®le : je suis tr√®s satisfaite !!"
Je suis ravie ! Tr?s jolie trousse et livraison tr?s rapide ! Merci
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
I previously ordered the matching earrings and now I have the pendant in the rose gold color. They‚Äôre beautiful and elegant. They are very versatile and can easily be worn with evening attire to casual attire and however you choose to wear them. The earrings are also comfortable and that‚Äôs one of the requirements for me. The chain that comes with the pendant is very small/narrow/thin and the clasp is as well. I have already have a different chain and a choker that I will use the pendant on. I highly recommend the pendant and the earrings.
Beautiful earrings! I had mine made as studs and with silver and there were no issues. They are gorgeous and comfy to wear. I paid for express shipping and they arrived (in Australia!) very quickly. I look forward to wearing them for my university graduation in May. Would order again!
These are just what i was hoping for! Thanks very much for righting the minor shipping error! I can't wait to wear these!! They're lovely!
Too cute ! Thanks for helping me with this order- you were very patient with me ! They arrived much sooner than I'd planned- such a nice surprise - thank you again
These are lovely and delicate. I got them as a gift for my cousin and I think she's going to love them!! Plus Virginia was helpful when there was a little issue. Thank you so much!!
Beautiful earrings! I love them!!! They were packaged beautifully too.
"I REALLY love these, they are absolutely my new go-to everyday earrings. Lovely bright silver, so light and comfortable and stay in position (don't fall down like some other ear crawlers I've had)."
"I got this for my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day and she absolutely loves them! She can‚Äôt stop gushing about them and says they make her look like an elven queen üßùüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëë Shipping took quite awhile, which is understandable for international. The only thing is that with the way the back works it makes it tricky to put in. Otherwise they are lovely!"
Je les ai re√ßu tr√®s rapidement. Tr√®s jolis colis et produits avec pleins de belles attentions ! J'en suis tr√®s contente et merci Anata !
"I absolutely love these earrings. They are exquisitely made, they fit beautifully and are very delicate and unusual. Plus they arrived in under two weeks to Australia. Thanks so much Anat."
Very hard to get on by myself with the post I chose but found some help and I love it! it‚Äôs gorgeous! Thank you!
These rare earrings are gorgeous. I absolutely love them. They look so beautiful in my ears.
My favorite earring. I wear it all the time. Easy to dress up and dress down!
"So beautiful on the cartilage. Superior customer service. My advice on these is to consider that the smallest length with fit extremely snug, I am happiest with the second to smallest size."
Love my new earrings!! I‚Äôm a nurse so I only wear these types of earrings for safety reasons and this shop is my new favorite go to!
I ordered 4 items and the shipping was very quick! They came in a little box and each set of earrings are so cute! I will definitely be coming back for more adorable earrings in the future!
Love them! Nice little studs that are comfortable to wear.not too big - ideal size for me. Packaged well and arrived quickly.
Very quick to reply & made sure my earrings got here in plenty of time before my wedding! I love them so much!!
"So beautiful!! These earrings are exactly as pictured‚Äì and look amazing when they‚Äôre in!! The gauge is larger than a standard stud earring, so be sure to take that into consideration if you have sensitive ears or a small earring hole. Can‚Äôt reccomend these enough!!"
"Seriously.stunning.earrings. They are my new favorite everyday pair. The picture, as lovely as it is, doesn't do them justice. Just gorgeous!"
"The quality of this is exquisite. I am not a gold person, but I chose the gold version of these ear climbers and I don't regret it at all. It's a beautiful addition to my very limited collection. The delivery was on time and the packaging is so nice - thank you."
I absolutely love these earrings! I bought the matching necklace too and I think I need to buy the ring now... The entire set is beautiful and feels well-made!
"Beautiful! The delivery took longer than expected but not by much, especially given that it‚Äôs COVID times. Great quality and look better that in pictures. I‚Äôve already worn them multiple times. Thank you!"
Super pretty! Picture doesn‚Äôt do just to how stunning these are
Elegant and sparkly! Adds instant subtle attraction and is not too over the top. I love the jacket type and this is the first of many!
My earrings arrived very quickly and in good condition. I absolutely love these earrings - so pretty and sparkly. The quality is great and they are now my new favorite earrings!
"Leider habe ich meine beiden Ohrringe gleich am ersten Tag beim Tragen verloren. Die seitliche Anbringung am Ohr ist m.E. nicht sicher. Sehr schade, denn der Ohrring und die Idee an und f√ºr sich haben mich online so beeindruckt."
Sieht wundersch√∂n am Ohr aus..tolle Verarbeitung und schnelle Lieferung. Perfekt
Sch√∂n gearbeitet und schneller Versand
Sehr sch√∂n gearbeitete Ohrringe. Schaut gut aus!
"wow... the earrings are stunning - I have received tons of compliments within first hour of wearing them. Brilliant, fast delivery, beautiful packaging. I will come back for more soon :)"

Beautiful earrings!!! They are so unique and I get so many compliments. They were a little tricky to put on but they stay put once you secure them on. Love them.
"What can i say, they are beautiful !! Beautifully made, and look gorgeous on, and comfortable to wear also look very expensive, at the price they are, they are amazing !! People comment on how lovely and where i got them from. So well done, i love them and thank you."

LOVE these earrings ! They are just what I was looking for . Simple and stylish and I can wear them everyday . Took a little longer to ship than expected but definitely worth the wait!
So adorable! Love them!
They are dainty and cute! love them!
I love them! Just what I hoped they would be. Thank you so much!!
"Great looking earrings and just what I wanted. A bit pricier than similar styles I looked at, but overall exactly what I expected. Thanks!"
Really Dainty and beautiful! Get lots of compliments!
My second product from glamrocks and I love these!
"Lovely and original earrings! This is my 4th purchase from this shop, and it's becoming one of my favourites from Etsy."
Very cute! Love the design and unique look of these! Fast delivery too. Thank you!
"Beautiful jacket earrings. Only concern is that the lace is just glued on to the round back of the earring so I hope that it stays in tact. Really nice colour though I was expecting it to be a bit more red than purple-y but I guess it's a little open to one's own perception of colour. My shipment arrived in 10 days, so I was happy with that."
Lovely earrings! I got a million compliments on the first day I wore them.
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
"Bonjour, Je viens de recevoir les boucles d'oreilles! Je suis ravie et h√¢te de les porter...Ma soeur va s√ªrement me les piquer aussi üòä‚ù§"
"Boucles d'oreilles jolies, tr√®s originales, et que je n'ai pas trouv√© ailleurs. J'ach√®te toujours chez Kasolya les yeux ferm√©es, je ne suis jamais d√©√ßue."
"Sympa mais comme c'est un produit unique et fait main, le tissu ne rend pas comme sur la photo : sur les 2 paires achet√©es (une pour offrir) il y a plus de rose, peu de couleur claire contrastante et pas de violet, √ßa fait moins wax et √ßa flashe moins mais tant pis, merci pour la rapidit√©"
"Magnifique ! Je m'attendais a des boucles un peu plus grandes mais √ßa ne me g√™ne pas comme √ßa. Encore merci, tr√®s beau bijoux ! :)"
"Envoi tr√®s rapide ( commande pass√©e hier!). Les boucles d‚Äôoreilles sont vraiment magnifiques, je suis tr√®s contente de mon achat."
"Bonne transaction, Bien arriv√©es, les boucles sont l√©g√®res et agr√©ables √† porter. La seule chose que je regrette est qu'il y a un c√¥t√© pile et un c√¥t√© face. J'aurais pr√©f√©r√© que le motif soit sur les deux c√¥t√©s"
"Parfaites, conformes √† la description et envoi rapide !"
"Ces boucles d'oreilles sont juste parfaites. Le rendu est d√©licat et sublime avec des cheveux longs ! Elles sont tr√®s l√©g√®res et agr√©ables √† porter. Je suis ravie de ma commande, qui √©tait emball√©e avec soin. Une de mes boutiques favorites <3 Merci du fond du coeur !"

Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles. Tr√®s contente de mon achat :-)
Beautiful craftsmanship and such a unique earring - just like the first one I bought!
"Beautifully done earring - I liked it so much, I've ordered a second to make a pair!"
Love them as a pair! Thanks again!
Lovely earring with high end and edgy design. Very fast shipping to the US. Courteous and communicative seller!
"belles boucles, bien qu'en vrai, bcp plus grandes que sur la photo + la couleur n'est pas rouge, mais rose ..."
"Bonjour Sandra, il parait que nous avons chacun notre ≈ìil pour voir une couleur! Je peux vous certifier qu'il s‚Äôagit bien d'un rouge, et pas d'un rose, de plus ,le diam√®tre des boucles d'oreilles √©taient bien indiqu√© sur le descriptif.Je suis d√©sol√© que vous ne soyez pas satisfaite de votre achat."
"belles boucles, mais en vrai, bcp plus grandes que sur la photo ..."
"le descriptif de ces boucles √©tait pourtant bien indiqu√© avec les dimensions exactes,Les photos que je prend ne sont pas modifi√©, et je prend la cr√©ation que je fais.Je ne comprend donc pas votre commentaire, je suis vraiment d√©sol√© que votre achat ne vous convienne pas."
tr√®s belles boucles ; conforme √† la photo !
"Cathy is one who can almost read my mind when it comes to putting together something. I have purchased some small pouches, a hair barrette and recently a pair of earrings. Some have been for presents but for the most part, I like her crafty items so much, I keep them for myself. In addition, I love the variety in her designs and the colors she uses as they tend to pop with a brightness that makes one happy"
"These ear cuffs are awesome. I love cuffs and the more the better. They were delivered so quickly, I had to look several times to see if they were actually from Scotland...but they are. I plan on buying more because the quality, speed and price just cannot be beat!"
"Love it! Stunning ear cuff and arrived super quickly. I ordered a couple of pieces to make my own set and had some small requests which were no trouble at all! All pieces are made to perfection, they are super easy to wear and look fantastic. I'm delighted and couldn't recommend more üòç"
Absolutely beautiful. I'm a leftie so I need my left ear clear for the phone. This fits my right ear and because it goes around into the ear the cuff is stable. It can't fall off.
"I got two of these ear crawlers and absolutely LOVE them!!! They're totally unique, classy and interesting. I may be tempted to be more... :) Mars"
Very beautiful! I love it and I am very happy with my purchase.
"Just arrived, I absolutely love them! Thanks for the great service."
Lovely & unusual - thanks
Produit conforme √† la description Fin et discret j'adore =)
Enfin une chaine √† la longueur recherch√©e. Difficile de trouver sa taille quand on a un cou fort. Son aspect l√©g√®rement brillant lui donne beaucoup d'√©l√©gance. Je ne regrette pas mon choix.
"L√©g√®rement brillantes, √©l√©gantes. Je suis ravie de mon achat !"
Tr√®s belle qualit√© et surtout tr√®s bel effet √† l'oreille. J'adore le fait que cela soit d√©licat et original √† la fois.
"I love the earrings, they are beautiful, will certainly buy here again, thank you very much."
Really pretty summery earrings. Delivery was almost by return. Great service!
These earrings are gorgeous and already causing people to admire them!
"I just received the cuff earring. It‚Äôs dainty and beautiful! So pleased. Highly recommend. Working from home, so nice to get this package delivered today from Israel!"
"Amazing! Such sparkle and so very comfortable. It's elegant, sexy, and fun all at once. Very well made and seller is wonderful to communicate with; it also arrived practically overnight - Thank You!"
Love my ring exactly what I wanted. Super fast work & shipping.
The necklace is beautiful! I received it in no time. Service was impeccable and just perfect. Best Xmas gift.
Super pretty earclimbers and a perfect size too. Thanks!
The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It‚Äôs super pretty but doesn‚Äôt have the flashes of blue I‚Äôm used to with moonstone. That said, it‚Äôs super pretty"
"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics; easy to put on and keep on."
They arrived 2 weeks after ordering & omg I am in love. They were a belated Mother‚Äôs Day present! I absolutely love them! I am probably about to order more!
Absolutely stunning climbers! I bought them for my sister for her birthday and they look even better in person than they do on the site. Great price and super fast shipping are an added bonus!
"These earrings are SO beautiful and have quickly become my favorite pair that I own! I get compliments every time I wear them. They arrived in a nice box with very clear instructions on how to put them on (basically, put them on upside down and swivel them into the correct position, don‚Äôt bend the post to get them into your piercing)."
Plan on using these for my wedding in July! I have the look of them and was looking for something that would cover both my first and second holes. These are so sparkly so they are perfect!
"I love these earrings. They are perfect for everyday, and they don't bother my sensitive ears. I've gotten many compliments on too:)"
"Good quality, very comfortable, looks great"
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"These earrings were in my favorites for quite some time before I finally decided to go for them (I was unsure about the length of the posts for example, but then I asked my questions online and the answer was quick and helpful). They arrived safely and I am very happy with them. The quality is very good and the posts are long enough for me to be sure I will not lose them while wearing them. I really appreciate the shape of the back piece, it is very flattering, so that despite their originality, the earrings end up being fantastically wearable with pretty much any kind of outfit. They are also very versatile as the shape becomes different with the length you chose thanks to the three wholes in the back piece. Thank you very much!"
"I had so many expectations about my new earrings and these beautiful jackets from Vasilia have fulfilled them all! I wanted earrings, that go well with my minimalistic outfits and are simple and small enough for being worn every day and for any occasion, but I didn't want any boring ""casual studs"". These jackets have a strong character, something everyone will notice - and not because they're super shiny and large, but because they're so unique and sophisticated. Casual and yet extraordinary. Bonus for minimalists and for capsule-wardrobers: they are variable, one can wear them with or without the jackets and in many-many variations by changing the stud-part (I'll surely try them with small pearl studs). Shipping was quick, without complications and they came in a really nice little box. I definitely recommend this shop!"
"Just got them and I am in love! Thank you so much, so nice tender design and great quality."
"I am a return customer, I just love love her work! Timely shipping, impressive packaging and kind customer service! Looking forward to future orders as gifts and for myself!"
"Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day. Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!"
"Totally my favorite earrings. Such s great idea and they look just wonderful. Good quality and everyone always asks about them and compliments them. Finding this product has totally gotten me into looking and purchasing more science inspired jewelry, I love it!"
"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!
"My experience with this seller was amazing! I have never had a package lost in the mail before and was worried about my package since it had been a month since my order was placed. I contacted the seller concerned, and they immediately sent out another package which arrived in days. I was so happy about their patience and understanding in the situation. For the earrings, they were exactly what I expected! I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they‚Äôre beautiful. The only thing is you have to get used to putting it in your ear, especially if you‚Äôre putting it in your second hole that you rarely put earrings in. My mom prefers them in her first hole, but I think they look beautiful in a second hole with a statement earring in the first. They‚Äôre not expensive at all and they come with great quality and customer service!:)"
"Loved these so much, I ordered my daughter a pair after I received mine. They are very dainty and feminine looking, but well made and sturdy. I have slept in them with no issues. Have received lots of compliments! I will definitely shop with this crafter again. Thank you for such a beautiful and unique product!"
I ordered 9 pairs for my girls and only 6 arrived. I messaged the company and they were super apologetic and helpful! The earrings themselves are dainty and sweet! Excited for my girls to wear them for my 12/1/18 wedding.
A Mother‚Äôs Day gift for my mom. She‚Äôs always wanted her ears done with multiple piercings but it‚Äôs super expensive to get done all at once. I got her these in the meantime!
Tr√®s beau bracelet que je vais offrir √† mon conjoint pour No√´l ! Je pense qu'il lui plaira !
"Merci pour l'envoi attentionn√©, mon amie adore votre broche"
Todo perfecto. Muy contento con la comprea.

Exactly shown as pictured. Came faster than expected! Love them!
Nice and unusual colored metals
Bblpoop
These earrings are light and very dainty and beautiful! They were a gift to my sister and she absolutely loves them. The shipping time To the US was quite long due to Covid BUT finally arrived .
"Absolutely gorgeous. These were a gift for my sister, who loved them. And I plan on buying a pair for myself after seeing them! I was worried they might be too big, but they are an absolutely perfect size."
I love these earrings. They were exactly what I expected and came right on time.
"Schnelle Lieferung und alles Top,kann ich nur weiter emfehlen."
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
super cute fast delivery thank you !!
super cute fast delivery thank you !!
"Parfait pour les trois ras de cou merci beaucoup, et re√ßus tr√®s rapidement en plus !"
Ravie tr√®s jolie dentelle. J‚Äôadore merci
Gorgeous earrings! Superb quality and came in a very nice case. Shipping to the US took just a few days shy of a month so keep that in mind. Very pleased with my purchase!
These earrings are beautiful and I love them. I use the jackets with other pearl earrings and that works very well.
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
I received the pearl ear climbers and very please with the craftsmanship. They are also known as ear pins. This pair has a modest and feminine characteristics about them which I will enjoy wearing. Not heavy on the ear lobe and the pin tread through the lobe is not to wide if you have a thick ear lobe.
If I could leave 10 stars I would. I ordered these for my wedding and they were perfect. Will cherish these earrings always.
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. I ORDERED ANOTHER PAIR IN GOLD
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
This is so pretty! The earring fits perfectly in my tragus and the flat back is easy to put it and remove. I requested a custom length and Rosec Jewels was able to accommodate. Very happy with the purchase!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
Earrings are lovely! The order was dispatched within a day and took just over 3 weeks to arrive in the UK. The seller was really helpful and prompt to reply when I messaged them. Overall incredibly happy.
beautiful!! seller was amazing at staying in contact too. these are for my wedding day.
"Nicely made, delicate sterling silver earrings with tiny sparkly zircons. Just the right thing for affordable holiday bling!"
"These are the second pair of these earrings I've bought! I'm just obsessed with these ones as I am the others. Such cute earrings, and I've gotten so many compliments."
"I can't recommend Draw a Dream Jewelry enough! I was on a hunt for gifts for my bridesmaids-to-be. I was going for a ""Bride Pride"" theme, so searching for cute and classy lioness items. I saw this bracelet listed and knew it would be perfect! Trouble was, I also have a guy in my bridal party. I reached out to Livia and asked if there was any possible way that the male lion charm, which I saw listed as a ring, could be made into a bracelet to match the lionesses. She was quick to respond, and to my delight was able to fulfill my request! They all arrived quickly and I was delighted to see that they all were exactly as I had pictured them! My bridespeople all LOVE them! We wear them out now on all wedding-related errands and plan to wear them on the actual wedding day as well. Thanks again!!!"
"Livia was very quick to respond to my messages and lovely too! I asked for the guitar pendant only, because I wanted to make a bracelet from leather strips and it turned out exactly how I've wanted. Livia was so sweet she even sent me a clasp and rings to be able to make my bracelet. The guitar is the perfect size and the textured version is even prettier than the one on the picture (in my opinion). Thank you, Livia!!"
"Lieben ‚ù§Ô∏è Dank f√ºr die super sch√∂nen Hai Ohrringe ü¶à ganz tolle Arbeit üòç ich freue mich sehr ‚ù£Ô∏èü•∞ Herzliche Gr√º√üe, Marion üòò"
"magnifiques !! taille parfaite et vendeuse plus que sympathique, encore merci !!"
"Nice, sturdy clasp, looking forward to having it on my omega necklace. Haven‚Äôt been able to wear both sides of chain because the old clasp was a standard type that did not accommodate the white vs yellow gold chain sides. Fast shipping, very responsive to questions and very accommodating! Thank you Christine for the service and quality merchandise too. All future needs will bring me back here before I look elsewhere. By the way, my jeweler wanted to sock it to me and charge me $168 for the same clasp. I‚Äôve had this chain for so long now that the clasp would have been more than I paid for the chain over 15 years ago. Trustworthy seller, if unsure, please reconsider, I have no regrets!"
"I liked the pendant and even though I measured what size it would be, it just seemed too small for my liking once I got it. That‚Äôs my fault! I decided to return it and the seller was awesome."
I‚Äôve waited so long for a Star of David Cross!! I already had the 14k gold ball chain to match with it! This piece holds a lot of personal meaning for me and the rose gold cross in the middle pick up the rose gold rose flower in my other piece. It brings everything together!
everyone comments on this beautiful piece. I make pendants and with the charm hold can change my necklace at will
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them. Shipping was super fast by the way, well impressed! I highly recommend getting something from UrbanRaven, you can tell she makes her jewellery with a lot of love. :)"
Love them! Gives a pop of color!
"I absolutely LOVE these earrings! Dainty, light weight...I received many compliments my first day wearing them. So well made. Thank you!! Fast shipping too!!"
Had 2 pair of these in my cart and another pair. All came together and shipping was very fast. The packaging is very sweet and let me say that the pictures do not do these earrings justice. So gorgeous in person. I love them. Ordering another pair. Quality is amazing! Earrings are extremely comfortable and light weight. So happy I ordered them.
Livraison rapide. Tr√®s joli snood que j‚Äôai achet√© pour ma fille. H√¢te qu‚Äôelle le porte cet hiver. Je recommande !
"Tout √† fait conforme √† la photo, bonne taille, beau mod√®le : je suis tr√®s satisfaite !!"
"tr√®s jolies boucles, elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite merci beaucoup !"
Je suis ravie ! Tr?s jolie trousse et livraison tr?s rapide ! Merci
Produit conforme √† la description Fin et discret j'adore =)
Enfin une chaine √† la longueur recherch√©e. Difficile de trouver sa taille quand on a un cou fort. Son aspect l√©g√®rement brillant lui donne beaucoup d'√©l√©gance. Je ne regrette pas mon choix.
"L√©g√®rement brillantes, √©l√©gantes. Je suis ravie de mon achat !"
Tr√®s belle qualit√© et surtout tr√®s bel effet √† l'oreille. J'adore le fait que cela soit d√©licat et original √† la fois.
So cute!!
"Envoi rapide, tr√®s jolies, La boucle d'oreille est un peu difficile a placer mais apr√®s elle ne bouge plus. Tr√®s contente !"
"They have arrived beautifully wrapped, and I am looking forward to opening them on Christmas day. Thank you. Merry Christmas"
I love these earrings! They arrived very quickly too
"I love my Cute lil Crawlers, there petite and cute they do not hurt my ears and have quite detailed design on small peace to work with... i would have done 5 stars if they came with a backing or something of the nature once u bend the post out to wear them it dosent quite lay down and the come out super easy!!!"
Wonderful climber earrings. So dainty and a great pattern. Thanks!
"Beautifully detailed as pictured. The only disappointment is that the pin in the back is just a little bit longer than the front, so if you're wearing these as hanging bars you'll see the end of the pin a tiny bit on the bottom. I assume they need to be this length in order to hold as an ear climber. It should be noted that these probably can't really be used as ear climbers if you have attached earlobes (earlobes that don't hang down) as they're a bit too big. All those things aside, these are still beautifully crafted earrings :)"
"Beautiful earrings, SUPER fast shipping and exquisite packing! It was like opening a present!"
"Beautifully made. Tested and no allergic reaction. Gorgeous. Just as pictured. I love that they are adjustable so you can customize to your unique ears - so comfortable. The jacket can be adjusted in 3 ways to customize the hang length, and the locks on the studs can be adjusted in 2 ways to customize how tight they fit. Artist was very responsive and professional in all communications, including a Canada Post hiccup (Canada Post system issue, nothing to do with artist). Highly recommend this shop. Beautiful designs and high quality."
"Diese Ohrringe sind wirklich ein Hingucker, sehr sch√∂n und wertig verarbeitet. Ich habe mir nur den hinteren Ohrring gekauft und kombiniere ihn mit verschiedenen Ohrsteckern. Der Versand nach Deutschland kann 4 Wochen dauern und es wird Zoll (in diesem Fall waren es ca. 5,-- Euro ) f√§llig. Der Kontakt mit Ester ist sehr nett und professionell . Gerne wieder!!! Ein 2. Paar ist bestellt."
Love love love these unusual and well-made earrings. I really like the adjustable depth holes on the stem -- everybody has different ears. haha. They add just the right touch to many of my outfits. Thank you!
"Love love love these. Beautiful quality, they sit perfectly even on my attached earlobes!"
"L'attente fut longue, mais je n'ai pas √©tait d√©√ßu, vraiment une belle paire de boucle, originale, simple et qui fait penser au drapeau turc. Juste un d√©tail qui m'a un peu d√©rang√©.. c'est que sa brille un peu trop √† mon gout, j'aurais pr√©f√©r√© un argent d'aspect plus mat (peut-√™tre est-ce d√ª au fait qu'il s'agit d'argent massif??)"
"I got this for my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day and she absolutely loves them! She can‚Äôt stop gushing about them and says they make her look like an elven queen üßùüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëë Shipping took quite awhile, which is understandable for international. The only thing is that with the way the back works it makes it tricky to put in. Otherwise they are lovely!"
Je les ai re√ßu tr√®s rapidement. Tr√®s jolis colis et produits avec pleins de belles attentions ! J'en suis tr√®s contente et merci Anata !
LOVE! Ordered these for my wedding day. Super boho and simple - exactly what I was looking for. Shipped extremely fast and seller was great to work with :)
Very happy with my new earrings! Looks just like the picture. Received it fast.
Muy bonitos. Son mis preferidos para lucir en estas fiestas.
Love the earring and the communication with the shop owner is beyond amazing! Highly recommend for the quality of the pieces she has!
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
"Divine earrings! They are looking beautifully, can't wait to wear them! Express shipping, great contact with the seller. Highly highly recommend :)"

LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I will be back!
Gorgeous piece. Thankful for the option to customize.
Gorgeous!!! True artistry from this shop. I am pleased and keep returning for more items.
Beautiful! I've purchased several sun catchers from MargayB and love each one. I highly recommend this site.
"So happy I purchased these!!! I'd been in search for wedding earrings for a while and kept coming back to these. I finally purchased them, a little late so I had to express ship them but the seller was very friendly and helpful and the earrings are BEAUTIFUL. 10/10 recommend!"
"Th√© earings are very beautiful and Dana very Kind good service. Th√© only fact is to be carefull with custom device because i live In europe, i had to pay 30 euros more. Thank you for you good customer service."
gorgeous. made it just in time to USA. quality superb.
"Very unique, already had multiple compliments and people wondering how I got the ""staple"" in my ear üòú I love the matte but I wish I got the polished, it would be more shiny"
I freaking LOVE these earrings!! The finish is lovely..and they're super comfy to wear too! Get some..you won't be disappointed :)
"Unique, gorgeous, one-of-a-kind. I adore my new jewelry, thank you Virginia! You are so talented and creative. Thank you also for being so responsive to my messages :) Happy New Year!"
They look so cool and everyone keeps asking where I got them. Everything is according to description and the packaging is cute.
Merci et bravo. Tr√®s satisfaite du joli travail que vous avez r√©alis√© √† partir des graines du flamboyant. A bient√¥t pour d'autres commandes.
belle cr√©ation - finition soign√©e - tr√®s l√©g√®res √† porter exp√©dition rapide sans probl√®me
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
"J'adore. Boucles tr√®s jolies. L√©g√®res, originales. Elles correspondent √† photo et √† la description. Colis rapide et soign√©. Merci"
Beautiful earrings just as pictured. Love them!! Well made I am very happy with them!
"Les boucles sont magnifiques et sont arriv√©e rapidement, merci beaucoup ! =)"
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
"Received my ADORABLE serotonin molecule earrings as a gift to myself for renrolling in school to become a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. They're so cute, dainty and wonderful! Also super easy to sleep with! I will be ordering more for sure!!"
Obsessed!!! I love how these fit on my ears. They‚Äôre so dainty and adorable.
Very nice! Arrived quickly. Very cute.
Gave as a gift. Appeared to be great quality and looked stunning. The gift recipient loved it!
"Pictures do not remotely capture the beauty of these gems!! This is my 2nd pair, the 1 set was beautiful I ordered up a size. Love Love Love them!!"
These earrings really are beautiful! Very sparkly! ‚ú® Love them! I purchased two pairs of 5mm and one pair of 4mm. They look the same as my real diamond earrings.
"I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far! I definitely see myself making future purchases for my loved ones (or for myself!)"
I love my studs. I‚Äôm going to order the next size - beautiful. Any more items on sale?
Absolutely gorgeous!! Can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day!
Love these earrings. They look awesome!
"I really like these ear climbers. They look really neat. It took me a little while to get them on correctly the first time, but once I got it just right, they look great. The seller shipped them out really fast and I'm really happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
It is very pretty. The only thing is it was a looter bit long for my ear but it still works!
Beautiful and comfortable! Excellent find!
Magnifique!!! Des coloriages personnalis√©s pour les jeunes invit√©s du bapt√™me de mon fils. La communication √©tait AU top et l‚Äôexp√©dition de la commande rapide. Merci encore !

"These are the coolest little earrings! I will be wearing these for my wedding in October and they go so well with my gold sequin dress and they ""tie in"" perfectly with the hand fasting we will be performing in our ceremony. These shipped pretty quickly and arrived well ahead of when I expected them. Thank you so much!"
They are just beautiful I love them
2 √®me commande chez vous et je suis ravie. Tr√®s belle paire. Je compte faire prochainement une autre commande. Bravo üòÄüëèüèø
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
"Sympa mais comme c'est un produit unique et fait main, le tissu ne rend pas comme sur la photo : sur les 2 paires achet√©es (une pour offrir) il y a plus de rose, peu de couleur claire contrastante et pas de violet, √ßa fait moins wax et √ßa flashe moins mais tant pis, merci pour la rapidit√©"
"Bonjour, Je viens de recevoir les boucles d'oreilles! Je suis ravie et h√¢te de les porter...Ma soeur va s√ªrement me les piquer aussi üòä‚ù§"

Fan fan fan !!! J'ai opt√© pour le pr√©nom de mon fils ü§ç je suis en Amour avec ces cr√©ations !
"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus"
These earrings are simply gorgeous and more than I could have hoped for. I definitely will be buying more from Miriam!
Perfect! Looks amazing on my giant earlobes and my daughter's nearly no lobes.
"These have been my favorite purchase on Etsy so far! They are absolutely stunning and I get compliments all the time when I wear them. They look to be very high quality, not cheaply made. You will not be disappointed!"
The most amazing Jewellery. So original and Edgy. Lots of people admire these amazing pieces
These are absolutely gorgeous!! Matches the rest of my white opal perfect!!
I got these for my mother for her birthday. She is in love!! They were shipped fast and the seller was super easy to work with!
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this offering. I have had so many compliments on them - thank yo for such a great earring - I will be back"
So pretty!
"Los pendientes son preciosos, los recib√≠ justo 7 d√≠as despu√©s de realizar el pedido y ven√≠an muy bien protegidos y con factura. Son bastante c√≥modos de llevar, aunque hay que acostumbrarse. En resumen, estoy encantada con el producto y merece mucho la pena por el precio que tienen."
"Love this! They are so simple, yet elegant. They hardly ever fall out, so definitely a great buy :) they shipped really fast too."
"I was worried these earrings would not stay on as I have extremely tiny ears, however I they stay put and look lovely!! Such a unique minimalist earing. Also the personalised note from the seller when I opened the package put a smile on my face :)"
Love them! Super comfy!
This piece is stunning and so perfect. The chain is dainty and small which goes well with the gem. The moonstone gleams blue in the light & radiates positive energy. The picture doesn‚Äôt even do it justice. Its beautiful in person. I am so happy with this purchase.
"Bonjour, j'ai re√ßu le bijou tel qu'il est en photo, dans une tr√®s jolie boite ton rouge tr√®s originale!!! Je n'ai rien de plus a rajouter , tout s'est pass√© correctement , et j'esp√®re que ce cadeau plaira √† ma fille (j'en suis sure!) , nous aimons toutes deux les pierres. Merci et √† bientot , peut etre ,,,,?????"
"The bracelet was sized perfectly and is very comfortable to wear. I also could feel the energy of the stones when I put it on. I've seen a lot of this type of bracelet for sale, but I don't think any are of the quality that this seller offers. She has a wonderful eye for detail, and everything is very well made. Highly recommended!"
Beautiful Mushroom Rhyolite pendant. Well packaged and shipped safely via registered mail. It‚Äôs well worth the wait because registered mail really takes long (and because of the pandemic took longer) even if the seller was mindful to ship the very next day after I bought it. Thank you!!
Gorgeous necklace and Amazing quality! Definitely would buy from here again!
"Absolutely gorgeous as is everything I have purchased. Wonderful detail in the jewellery, lovely packaging and prompt postage. Thank you as always for beautiful jewellery!! üòä"
Very cute!
Beautiful!!! One of the best shop. :)
"These are even prettier in person! I rarely see RQ merchandise, let alone jewelry, so I knew I had to snag one of these for sure when I saw Victoria Aveyard herself post it. I love the earrings!"
"I apsolutely adore them! Beautifly packed, gorgeously done. I am so happy to have them. Wonderful work and I strongly reccomend them!"
All I can say is this: Perfection.
"The seller was very commutative and created a beautiful piece of jewelry. For anyone who is a fan of the red queen series, this piece is perfect!"
THIS PAIR OF EARRINGS ARE STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL!! THEY ARE VERY WELL MADE AND DAINTY!! VERY NICE SELLER THAT RESPONDS QUICKLY TO QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE!! THANK YOU! üòçüòçüòç
Beautiful earrings!!!!
Theses earrings are absolutely fantastic. They came extremely fast and I had no complications ordering them.
These are perfect!!! I searched everywhere for ear climber earrings and these are exactly what I wanted. They are simple enough to wear everyday and classy enough to wear for nicer events. They are super comfortable too!! Resisting the urge to buy them in more colors. Thanks!!!
"Love these. Simple, but great for a change to my go-to studs."
The best little earring jackets - so sassy! Dress them up or down. Love!!
Love these earrings and jackets! Well made with a lovely handmade feel. I like the size of the jackets -- enough to be noticed but not too large or overwhelming. They arrived beautifully packaged with some extra little goodies and nice little touches as well. Thanks so much!
"Super cool, versatile. I can wear them with almost all of my post earrings!"
I needed something to go with my diamonds and these went perfectly. They are super cute and they actually stay put very well. I definitely want to buy more now!
"Absolutely fabulous! Service, delivery, cute packaging, great product, photo does not do it justice! Def recommend! Proud to give as gift! Thank you.xxx Bought the ear climbers in rose gold and silver."
"The earrings I ordered are beautifully simple, I love them and the customer service is second to none."
Not a style I had tried before so this was a subtle and lovely introduction - very easy to wear. Arrived in a timely manner. Thank you.
"Love, love, love these silver jackets. I'm wearing them with the rose gold ones I bought previously and they look great, especially with pearl studs. I'm sure I'll be adding to my collection. Highly recommended!"
"Emma is a great artist! I placed a custom order which included the ruffled and diamond edge in many colors, they were made, shipped, and received very quickly. I was so impressed on their beauty that I ordered 2 more sets for my daughter-in-laws for Christmas. They both said the same thing, ‚ÄòGorgeous‚Äù!! Thank you Emma, you made our Christmas extra-special, all three of us are in mix-and-match heaven, lol!"
"l cannot recommend this shop highly enough! I love everything that l have purchased, including these ear jackets, and look forward to all of the new creations to come! Thanks Emma!"
"Finally, I found the silver jackets that I was looking for to enhance several of my small earrings. It was just what I needed. I‚Äôm very happy with the jackets. I might consider buying the next bigger size to make it a double layer."
The pictures don't do these chains justice! The sparkle on these chains is unreal. They are perfect for adding a bit of edge to stud earrings
These are a little something to add an interesting sparkle to my diamond studs. Great quality! Natalie is so helpful and her jewelry is the best!!
"I used this chain to create a chain industrial piercing and I keep getting compliments! It's so pretty, will get more"
"Beautiful product, great price. A little trouble with package tracking but the item clearly made it here safe. Very happy!"
conforme √† la photo. belles couleurs.
I love the shape and color of these earings and how they are the perfect size. Thank you for beautiful earings and quick shipping!
"S√©rieux, de qualit√©, je recommande !"
"Parfait, comme d'habitude! Je recommande"
"The backs of the earnings took me a bit to figure out, but once I did they were fantastic. They came in a cute little bottle with a handy card on how to take care of them, which I really appreciate!"
Really love my ear cuffs. Only problem is doesn't stay put very well but still worth the price and is something unique. Plus the items came earlier than expected. Thank you so much!!!
Exactly what I wanted!! Completely love them. Thank you so much!!
Thank you Ara for this Beauty! So wonderful!
I absolutely love my items and the shop owner was absolutely amazing to work with and very pleasant.
Env√≠o r√°pido. Buena comunicaci√≥n. Vendedor recomendable.
Beautiful earrings! Didn't have to pay duties but had to use upgraded shipping method to ship to Canada.
"For the price, these look extremely cheap unfortunately. The wire material also bends very easily when simply putting the back closure on. They also took nearly a month to arrive. With all the high reviews I'm quite disappointed in this product."
"Ordered the hammered climbers for my wedding day, along with the modern minimalist set of 2 cuffs and both were great quality. Love the style... and very versatile. Perfect for everyday & special occasions too."
Love the ear climbers. They fit well and never fall off. Love the hammered look of the metal. I‚Äôve had my pair for about 2 years and I buy these for friends also!
They look lovely on. Thank you! x
exactly as described. Will buy other colour options one day
"So so happy with these! Beautiful rose gold colour that go with anything I wear, sit really comfortably and I've had many a compliment whilst wearing. Super quick service would highly recommend. Thank you"
"The earrings were lovely, good quality and arrived well and quickly through the post. Good communication from Abi re delivery so really happy with my purchase. They fit and stay climbing up my ear really well. Will buy from her again."
Love these earrings - beautifully made. Speedy delivery and attractively packaged. Highly recommend
"LOVE these. Ordered as a gift for my sister, but now I need some for myself. Hand made, great shape and fit. Came in lovely packaging too."
These are beautiful !! bought them as a gift and they were carefully packaged and arrived on time. I cant stress enough how pretty and delicate these are. Would def buy again :)
I'm just in love with my new hair clips! The packaging was beautiful and the shipping was quick! I will most definitely buy again from this shop!
J'adore ces boucles d'oreille ! Elle sont l√©g√®res et durables et d√©taill√©es. Article envoy√© rapidement dans une super petite bo√Æte ! Merci
These earrings are very well made. Love the colour. Can wear them for both dressy or casual wear. Very quick delivery. Will definitely order from this supplier again.
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"The earrings are exactly what I wanted. I needed amethyst ones which the seller was able to accommodate. I would 100% recommend jewelry from this seller. The earrings are beautiful, and I was also able to use the studs for my engagement pictures."
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
"Absolutely stunning, even better in person! They arrived really quickly, too. Thank you!"
"Beautiful jewelry! Great quality and it shipped fast. Only issue is that on the shop page the seller claims that the items are shipping from the U.S., however, I was charged a foreign transaction fee. I even had my results filtered on the Etsy app to only show those shipping from the U.S. If I would have known this, I would have used a different credit card to avoid the fee. Just want others to be aware before ordering!"
"That is not true, we simply use an international payment provider. Your order like the others was shipped right out our studio in US. You're welcome to check it via the tracking number if you wish."
"The climbers are pretty, solid, nicely made. I bought the climbers to hide some of my old piercings."
Loved it!!! Fast shipping to EU
Just what I wanted. Love these!
"Super cute earrings, very little but detailed. These are a Christmas gift so unsure how the fit is. Planning on buying some for myself soon! Really pretty. Shipped super fast too! Ordered on 11/26 received on 12/2 from CA to ME."
"As a bow hunter I love these so much! Price is amazing, they‚Äôre comfortable, and I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments."
One of one pair had a silver burr on the post. Was able to shave it down with an Emery board. Please check the posts before shipping.
"Love these! Perfect addition to my everyday jewelry. Simple and sweet, but different :)"
Tr√®s beau bracelet que je vais offrir √† mon conjoint pour No√´l ! Je pense qu'il lui plaira !
"Merci pour l'envoi attentionn√©, mon amie adore votre broche"
Todo perfecto. Muy contento con la comprea.
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
Very professional! The seller privately messaged me about my earrings and shipped them very fast. I had text messages too with updates from the postal service. The earrings themselves are beautiful. Excited to wear them...the case they came in was really nice and professional looking. Their jewelry would make great gifts! Thanks and happy holidaze‚úåÔ∏èüòé
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure

The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)"

"Parfait comme d'habitude!! C'√©tait un cadeau qui a imm√©diatement plu, et pas qu'√† la principale concern√©e!!! Merci Jo√´lle."
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
This is so pretty! The earring fits perfectly in my tragus and the flat back is easy to put it and remove. I requested a custom length and Rosec Jewels was able to accommodate. Very happy with the purchase!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I will be back!
"I really like these ear climbers. They look really neat. It took me a little while to get them on correctly the first time, but once I got it just right, they look great. The seller shipped them out really fast and I'm really happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
These are beautiful. I also have the same style in silver. Classic. My absolute favorite earrings!
I absolutely loved the earrings! I have been wearing them ever since I got them. Very good quality. I absolutely would buy from this shop again.
I love it! I got size 2-2 1/2 and was worried it was going to be too small but it's perfect!
Beautifull!
"It was the second time I placed an order with AgJc, the earrings are as beautiful as my first pair, will order again for sure. Perfect delivery and client service. Thank you!"
Exactly as pictured
"amazing, really unique earrings - great purchase. i'd definitely buy from this shop again."
I love the earrings and receive many compliments when I wear them. They are of a high quality and great craftsmanship. Seller was lovely - super fast shipping and great service. I will definitely be recommending to my friends.
Love these ratings and earring jackets. A bit heavier than I anticipated but they‚Äôre comfortable and I get compliments every time I wear them!!
"So classy!Bright chain that makes the choker looks luxurious.I love it!It was inside a tiny envelope sealed with a sticker heart and at the front part was written 'You are the star"" .I feel the positive vibes already!I highly recommend this shop :)"
I love them sooo much!
It is beautiful. I bought it for my daughter's birthday and she loves it. The pearl is her birthstone and she loves the simplicity of the design. She can wear it with anything. Thank you for making something so lovely for such a reasonable price.
"I bought two sets of these one for myself and one for my goddaughter, since we have matching sun/moon tattoos. They are gorgeous and well made and we love them."
"Bonjour, Je viens de recevoir les boucles d'oreilles! Je suis ravie et h√¢te de les porter...Ma soeur va s√ªrement me les piquer aussi üòä‚ù§"
"Envoie rapide et soign√© Vendeuse au top, je recommande"
Elles sont vraiment magnifique. Merci.
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
I had to purchase a second pair because my sister took the first pair! She loved them as much as I do. These shipped so fast !
They are gorgeous and just what I wanted. Fast shipping.
"Came nicely gift wrapped. Perfect size for a pretty, understated stud earring look. My first time purchasing invisible clipons! They were initially too tight, so I put them on a pen overnight to slightly widen them. Now I can't feel them when they're on! Be careful when putting it on the thin part of your ear and then sliding it down to the earlobe, as the plastic may scratch against your ear, but it gets better with practice. Also be gentle when fixing your hair so your earrings don't get moved. I got the violet color, which looks paler in real life compared to the photos but still beautiful."
Perfectly wrapped and arrived earlier than expected! Highly recommend this shop!
"Beautiful! Came on time, recipient loved them."
"Beautiful earring, absolutely stunning! Took me a while to figure out how to get it in but it looks absolutely fantastic and I love it! Unfortunately it does not stay in place. Since it rests on the cheek, it moves along with its movement. So it needs frequent checking, I'm afraid otherwise its going to slip out."
"Livraison rapide, article conforme. Ces boucles d'oreilles-grimpeurs sont tr√®s √©l√©gantes ! Je les adore !"
Super cool earrings! Light and easy to wear...oh yeah..and very chic!
"These earrings are absolutely great, I get compliments all the time"
Beautifully packaged and made with love and care! Will be ordering for stocking fillers! Thank you üòä
"Gorgeous ear crawlers, beautifully made - love them! super fast delivery too."
"Sorry for the delayed review...these are adorable and beautifully boxed and ready to ""gift""...these are gifts for friends and exactly what I was looking for."
"Lovely ear crawlers, exactly as described, would highly recommend this shop"
"I love this piece! It‚Äôs so cute! I will say that if you like leaving your jewelry in for long periods of time, you will need to like just go over the jewelry with like a cotton swab and something to clean it with. Gets kinda dirty fast for some reason! Will buy from this seller again. Lol I‚Äôm like super faded in the pic but it shows the jewelry so whatever lol"
"I love the nose ring so much I ordered 4! Lol, for my double nostril and double helix."
"Shipping was incredibly fast. Ear crawler is very unique, just as pictured and and I am satisfied with this overall purchase. Thank you"
I love this nose ring. It‚Äôs so beautiful and I get compliments all the time. Shipping was fast!
When I saw these earrings I thought they looked sexy. So I bought them! If you want to make yourself look sexy try these earrings!
Kristina's work is exquisite! I combined these with another pair I bought and they look so avant garde together! Love!
Purchased this set of beautiful and unique earrings for my wife for her birthday. Kristina was awesome to deal with - she was in contact as soon as the order was placed and kept me up to date with everything. She even took the time to gift wrap them for me! I would highly recommend Kristina if you are looking for that something a little bit different but with a touch of class.
"Sooooo beautiful, looks amazing. Thank you"
these are so pretty.thank you
"alles perfekt, tolle Ware, schneller Service :)"
"It was a gift for my mother, and she loved it! Thanks you!"
"Earrings are beautiful and the packaging was pretty and thoughtful. (Included jewelry cleaning cloth, gift bag, gift box and storage bag for after wear.) These were a ft, but I may need to buy myself a pair. :)"
"Update: Yuju was so gracious and eached out to offer me an 16 inch chain and it completely transformed the necklace. I used it wear the necklace inside my clothes because it was long and too dangling, now I‚Äôm wearing it on top of my tops and so happy with it! :) I love this modern and organic design, I may consider getting this artists other pieces in the future. Tho I wish seller offer different necklace length as mine is a bit longer than I would normally wear, plus the hook of necklace came undone a couple of times."
"This is my second time to purchase this lovely budding necklace. I've had one for myself, and I found it's very well made, easy care and great design! So I decided to have it as a gift to my sis, and I know she will love it! It also comes with a gift box & a nice storage bag, which makes gifting much easier! Also, the shipping is very prompt. The end-to-end process only took several days. Very impressive. Highly recommend!"
So beautiful! I‚Äôm in love with this necklace and the packaging was so lovely. Will definitely be purchasing from again for future gifts
"Great quality, beautiful design and quick service. Absolutely love my order!!"
Absolutely stunning and of good quality! Shipping was fast.

Everything I wanted and more! Delivery was quick and I have gotten so many compliments and people asking me where they can get some!
"Love.. Love.. Love.. Did I say LOVE?!? I absolutely LOVE my necklace that Lynn made for me. Current live in Las Vegas but I'm orginally from Hawai'i, Kaua'i, specifically from the Northshore. üíúüåàüåäüå¥üå∫‚òÄÔ∏è I got this necklace as a birthday gift to myself, I carry soo much pride wearing it!

"Ladies, I‚Äôm telling you.. the best light weight earrings and gorgeous. It can be complimented as casual and dressy! Best purchase to add to my jewelry wear."
"I love these earrings. I was looking for something like this for a while and I'm really glad I went with these ones. They are really light weight, don't irritate, and are comfortable even though they long. They make a great statement piece and still work if you have additional piercings. Highly recommend the earrings, they came faster than estimated and were beautifully packaged."
"These earrings are BREATHTAKING. The packaging was pristine and super neat, came with a lovely hand written note. The card the earrings are attached to is high quality and beautiful watercolor. I am so happy with this purchase and so excited to wear my new earrings! Thank you so much!!! :) I am so happy to be one of your first dozen orders!"

"Passez votre chemin, sauf si vous ne prenez pas consid√©ration des d√©lais de livraison et de la qualit√© d'une communication..! La vendeuse elle n'y accorde aucune esp√®ce d'importance..! j'ai re√ßu un num√©ro de suivi qui apparaissait comme inconnu aupr√®s des services de la poste 5 jours apr√®s l'avoir re√ßu, j'en informe donc la vendeuse qui me demande de faire moi-m√™me la r√©clamation aupr√®s de la poste alors que le num√©ro est comme je l'ai indiqu√© inexistant, c'est logiquement √† l'exp√©diteur de le faire en fournissant les preuves d'envoi vu qu'elle seule pouvait les poss√©d√© , chose qui a enfin √©t√© faite au bout de plusieurs mails, plus d'une semaine, un √©change ex√©crable et un litige ouvert..!! Je d√©conseille vivement."
"La bague me pla√Æt mais un peu grande, j'ai du la mettre sur le pouce."
"Que des merveilles, dans cette boutique ! Je recommande vivement, et merci pour le joli cadeau !"
envoi rapide ! jolie perle
"Simple, mais parfait. J'adore, car les gens prennent le temps de regarder."

These earrings came faster than expected even though I ordered them on a busy weekend. Beautiful. Chi miigwech!
I ordered Porcupine earrings from here and absolutely LOVE them! I had asked about the sizing of the earrings and they were really kind in answering questions and even sent me a picture of a few of the earrings to choose from. They responded within the hour I had asked about them. I had the earrings within 2 weeks after ordering. Would definitely recommend buying from this vendor.
"Love,Love these earrings, just what I ordered,Awesome"
Most beautiful earrings I own! Absolutely in love!
"Tr√®s l√©ger et agr√©able √† porter, j'en avais command√© deux autre faits sur mesure pour mes ni√®ces ; les trois colliers sont arriv√©s rapidement et nous ont √©norm√©ment plu √† toutes les trois !"
"Sehr nette Kommunikation, super sch√∂nes Halsband (auch mit nur einer Niete :-) ). Ich sage: Merci, Thank you, Danke sch√∂n!!! - auch f√ºr die h√ºbschen Ohrringe als Ersatz f√ºr 2 Nieten ;-) ."
"Collier fait sur mesure que j'ai offert √† ma petite ni√®ce ; il lui va parfaitement, elle en est ravie ! Mes deux ni√®ces portent d'ailleurs chacune leur collier autour du coup depuis que je le leurs ai offerts !"
Je suis tr√®s contente de mon achat. Je trouve la broche encore plus belle en vrai qu'en photo. Elle √©tait envoy√©e dans un super pochon. Merci beaucoup alittlediary !
"Item is as described, packaged well and undamaged. Thank you!"
Simply beautiful!!!! Shipping was delayed because of the pandemic. The supplier was very patient and informative during my wait for the package. IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!!!
Excellent quality. I brought this to replace a pair that's no longer a pair I lost one side. But this pair I much prefer over my old one so much better. Definitely recommend this seller.
Thank you Khon khun ka these earrings are so dainty I love these
"I absolutely love these! They are a little bit more tiny than I expected but that‚Äôs okay, I love them just the way they are! They are real silver, I did a couple of at home tests to confirm it and I have extremely sensitive skin, so if they weren‚Äôt real silver I couldn‚Äôt wear them for long periods of them. I have been wearing them for a little over 48 hours and my ears are fine! I highly recommend those, they are super cute, great quality and got here (Canada) very quickly! ü•∞ü¶ïü¶ñ"
"stunning, they are very delicate. I had an issue, but seller fixed it right away! I will definitely buy from again."
"At first I was disappointed, I bought this to wear as an anklet but it‚Äôs a little bit too small. I added some of my own extra chain and it‚Äôs PERFECT!! Seriously the cutest evil eye anklet everüßø"
Amazing! Super dainty and cute.
I LOVE these earrings. They are even better than I hoped they would be (and I had high hopes). Will definitely shop here again!
These are absolutely stunning. I feel so elegant! I have tiny ears so the birds cover pretty much the whole bottom half of my ear but I still think it looks great. They are difficult to get in unless you bend the backing to straighten out the angle quite a lot.
"I love these earrings! They are beautiful, and detailed. Everything about them is wonderful! From the packaging to how it fits. There is nothing I would change about it!"
"These are the sweetest earrings and are so comfortable to wear! I love them! I will definitely order from arajera again! The packaging was awesome, in a little bottle! Shop early for the holidays because it did take nearly a month to arrive from the Philippines! ‚ù§"
"Absolutely love them! They arrived faster than I thought and are stunning. I've gotten several compliments already and they are very comfortable to wear, even when sleeping. My new favorite earrings!"
"Gorgeous , gorgeous and absolutely stunning and thank you Beautriz :)"
I love these earrings! I have sensitive skin and they don't bother me at all. They look great - I think I'm going to get a lot of wear out of these.
I love these earring! Their size is perfect and clip in place without moving for a long time.
I just received these today and they are absolutely stunning! They came with super cute packaging and hand written care instructions. All around 10/10
Super cute and unique earrings. I love how light they are. I have some other earrings of this size and they‚Äôre too heavy to wear comfortably. Shipping took a little while but they were worth the wait. Packaging was performed gift giving... but I‚Äôm keeping them for myself ; )
My new favorite necklace I wear with everything. It fits the classy boho look I was going for and it‚Äôs so light I don‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs there.
"These earrings are true stunners. Before purchasing I worried they‚Äôd be too big on me but they‚Äôre so delicate and feminine that they can afford to be big! Each time I wear them, I‚Äôve had numerous people stop me in public and also on zoom meetings to ask what kind of hair clip/necklace/earrings/‚Äúmagical face mask‚Äù I‚Äôm wearing. They effortlessly elevate my outfits and they somehow also make me feel confident enough to not wear much makeup while wearing them. They were packaged so nicely and included a very sweet and thoughtful handwritten note with a gracious thank you from the seller/artist as well as a couple of tips in caring for these gems (including the little bag she suggested keeping them in). I can not wait to purchase more pieces!"
"Super c'est conforme √† la photo , d√©lai de livraison respect√© et puis je suis tr√®s satisfaite de mon choix."
Exquisite piece of beading. It used very small beads and is a lovely piece of jewellery.
jolies boucles d' oreilles pas trop grandes. merci beaucoup
Boucles d'oreilles tr√®s jolies. Satisfaite de mon achat.
"Merci, boucles d'oreilles bien arriv√©es et couleurs tr√®s chouettes."
superbes boucles d'oreilles correspondent aux photos
Such a gorgeous pair of earrings! LOVE the nature inspired design with seeds. So delightful and unique. Will be back for more from this shop! üòä
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
Tr√®s jolies BO. J'aime leur √©l√©gance et la finesse du travail du fil d'argent. La livraison a √©t√© ultra rapide dans un emballage tr√®s s√©curis√© + un bel √©crin pour les prot√©ger. Merci √† sheilandi pour son professionnalisme.
This bracelet was perfect. It came in a lovely presented box with ribbon and frills. The piece itself looked just like the pictures. It was beautiful and a great gift for my girlfriend. I would rate the quality of work highly.
"elles sont magnifiques , envoi rapide et service apr√®s vente super! merci encore"
"tr√®s beau cadeau pour ma soeur, merci"
"This is my second purchase from this shop and I am just as satisfied. This time instead of gold I ordered rose gold, I really love it. It‚Äôs a sweet color, even a little lighter than I expected but I prefer that. It is so comfortable which I thought it would feel more tight around the ear but it‚Äôs even comfier than the gold one I ordered. Def recommend. Cute and unique. On the left is the gold one I purchased, right is rose."
"Beautiful craftsmanship! My daughter doesn‚Äôt have pierced ears, so this cuff is perfect way to ‚Äòdress up‚Äô her ears for prom!"
I love the flexibility of this piece! I have smaller ears and I bent it a little so that it fit perfectly!
"I absolutely just love this piece! The photos do not do it any justice; delicate, tranquil and looks like something straight out of the Lord of the Rings series!!!"
super cute and the perfect size
"I'm so happy with this purchase! I didn't notice that they were coming from the UK so they took a little bit longer than usual, but arrived well within the shipping estimate. They were worth the wait - I love the delicate detail and matte finish and the price was very reasonable."
"These earrings are beautiful! They were a gift, the person receiving them loved them. They came in simple but lovely packaging to gift them in, plus a little cloth to polish them with. Really quick dispatch and delivery too!"
Lovely! Just the right size for my diamond earrings. The gold is just the right amount of shine to show them off. Very pleased with this purchase and the seller.
I ordered 3 sets of earring jackets and am crazy about them all. I own a lot of small earring studs and these jackets dress them up just as I'd hoped. Thanks you so much.
"I have been looking EVERYWHERE for these earrings. Not only did these cost less than my other options but the QUALITY IS BETTER. Better than Nordstrom and kate spade options. Sparkly and stunning. Great for every day with jeans or to wear out to dinner, weddings and prom."
Absolutely beautiful!!! So happy with my purchase. I've gotten many compliments already. Earrings are well constructed with extreme attention to detail. Very talented designer!! Highly recommended seller.
"Shipping was a bit delayed, but seller responded immediately. The earrings are gorgeous and quality is phenomenal. Would buy again."
Most amazing ring I have ever laid my eyes on. I wear it all the time and never take it off other than to do dishes or shower and sometimes when I sleep. The energy is intense and it is very much loved. Thank you!!! I am so happy that it is mine. <3 Thank you for your amazing talents.
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much. I love it. I have one ear piercing already but I didn't want to have more ear piercings 'cause my parents wouldn't allow me to. But luckily I came across these on Etsy. These earring make me look like I have three ear piercings.
so beautiful!! getting lots of positive comments on them :D delivery took only 2 weeks.
"Always worth the wait!!! Third time I have ordered, the climbers always fit great. She does a great job. Can't beat the price and I find them to be well made, and the color is very vibrant. Thank you once again for such a well made beautiful üëÇ piece. I can't say enough."
"Oh my god I LOVE IT!!! Didn't have to wait long. I love them so much. I've been wearing them non stop, especially at work and received so many compliments on how good they look. Came in the cutest packaging and with a instruction card on how to take care of them so you can keep them for longer. Already purchasing more items and have recommended to all my friends"
Really cool! Way easy to wear. Very fun and different. I got compliments all weekend.
"They are beautiful and delicate, can be dressed up or down. I wore them to a party last night and got tons of compliments. Would also be great for every day wear. They stayed on very well, no problems with slipping. I love them!!"
"I love this product and this seller. I have bought these twice now (stupidly lost my first set... that I bought a year and a half ago) and sent many friends to buy them as well. I consistently get compliments on them. I wear them every day and they still look brand new. The earring is sturdy but soft enough that I can tighten it around my ear. Additionally this seller is so easy to work with, the seller quickly helped me with a specific request on my order, with no trouble. I have, and will, be a repeat customer."
"I absolutely LOVE these earrings! I've gotten so many compliments with them. I also got gave a pair to my sister and a pair to one of my bridesmaid for her birthday! Beautifully chic, great quality for everyday use and so affordable! I wish I knew about this company from this past Christmas. But I'll know for this year. ;)"
Really great! Love it :)
Very pretty earrings and nice quality!
"Ich liebe diese Ohrringe! Der Versand hat l√§nger gedauert als angegeben, da habe ich den Verk√§ufer angeschrieben und der Kundenservice ist mega! Man bekommt schnell Antworten und er hat ein neuer Paar losgeschickt. Sie sitzen super. Man muss sich ein bisschen an den Sitz und das an die Ohren klemmen gew√∂hnen, aber nach 2 Tagen klappts perfekt üòÑ Ich habe schon viele Komplimente bekommen und man bleibt nicht an den Ohrringen mit der FFP Maske h√§ngen. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Je suis d√©√ßue par ce mod√®le... Le motif dans le cabochon semble trop petit du coup il y a du jour entre les deux. La finition est moyenne...
je suis d√©sol√©e d'apprendre votre insatisfaction sachez que la boutique accepte les retours.....
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
These earrings are so lovely in gold! Can‚Äôt wait to wear them!
Great item. I love them!
These are a Christmas present but look great. I'm sure they will be much appreciated. Best worn if you have little earlobes - which I have checked on the person they are meant for.Great.
Beautiful earings and great shop !!
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. It‚Äôs such a dainty ring and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it.
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."
Absolutely gorgeous! I've received lots of compliments. Fast service.
Gorgeous earrings and they look exactly like the photos. I was worried that my ear lobes would be too small but they fit perfectly. Thank you!
"The earrings were lovely, good quality and arrived well and quickly through the post. Good communication from Abi re delivery so really happy with my purchase. They fit and stay climbing up my ear really well. Will buy from her again."
"So so happy with these! Beautiful rose gold colour that go with anything I wear, sit really comfortably and I've had many a compliment whilst wearing. Super quick service would highly recommend. Thank you"
"LOVE these. Ordered as a gift for my sister, but now I need some for myself. Hand made, great shape and fit. Came in lovely packaging too."
"Really delicate, gorgeous earrings. Great quality, beautifully crafted - they are exactly as they look. Well packaged and arrived quickly in a fab presentation box. Can‚Äôt wait to give them to my sister. Thank you!"
They are absolutely beautiful! I will definitely purchase from this seller again.
I love the earrings. They are really beautiful and I plan on using them for daily wear
"I love them!! As I looked at my options, the shop was great with helping me decide if I should do something custom, or purchase these. I was looking for a dainty pair of diamond earrings, but didn‚Äôt want solitaire studs. I love Art Deco style jewelry, and the baguette diamonds on these studs give me that vibe. They are absolutely perfect, and the mixed metals of white gold & yellow gold on my ear look awesome. Thank you!"
"I absolutely adored this earrings. They look even better in person, as the variation of colors make the yellow sapphires really pop out. They are very dainty and elegant, yet sexy and so unique at the same time. I liked these so much that I ended up getting a second pair in Rose Gold with Ruby eyes!"
"It already broke , I‚Äôm so upset. I wore it one timeüòî. I don‚Äôt know what to say, I was so excited to get this . I loved the way it looks."
"These earrings are really pretty and lighter than I anticipated, which is good!"
I LOVE THE EARRINGS THEY ARE SUPER LARGE ü§óI WAS SURPRISED! U DESERVE (5) STARS MY PHONE APP ONLY LEAVES 4 SORRY!
Absolutely gorgeous!!! Will buy from them again
I really really love this earrings :). They look nice on my ears and I got compliments on how lovely it looks. Thank you very much :). Highly recommend.
"Vielen Dank f√ºr diese tollen, einzigartigen Ohrringe. Die Verarbeitung und Qualit√§t ist super, und au√üerdem ging der Versand richtig schnell, hat keine Woche gedauert."
They are stunning! I have pretty sensitive ears. The weight nor the material irritate them. Will stay in place pretty well. Highly recommend.
"Amazing! Te color violet is gorgeous, and they're very comfy. Totally worth it!"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
"An appreciative and big ""WOW"" is the first reaction I had when I received my first pair (but definitely not my last!) of Kathy's gorgeus creations. They are wonderful, light weight, beautiful and well -- just fun! Plus, as her shop descriptions explain so well, they can be worn in so many different ways so you are really getting far more than just one pair of earrings. While the product is what you are purchasing, Kathy's caring, prompt and wonderful service is among the best of the best. Ditto the eye-catching packaging too. Thank you, Kathy, for being there and for sharing your amazing talents with all fortunate enough to cross paths with you and your great Etsy shop!"
"Love these earrings. I love them so much, do they come in a larger size? I would be interested. If they do, please let me know. Thanks."
"Lovely earrings, exactly as expected!"

Tres jolie cr√©ation je recommande
"I bought these as a treat for myself. I love ear crawlers and jackets and wanted a rose gold pair to wear with some necklaces I have. These were just right! Shiny and not too big. The packaging was very luxe and these arrived first out of several things I ordered. My sis noticed them when I wore them and gave me a compliment. :D The packaging did say they were made in China so they're good quality fashion jewelry, which is what I expected for the price point. All in all I'm happy with this purchase and definitely would purchase from this shop again! The packaging is nice enough for gifts, too."
"These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)"

Snelle levering en bovenal gaan ze makkelijk in en uit en blijven ze goed zitten. Mooi en praktisch dus.
Thank you these ear climbers are beautiful and I am wearing them a lot.
Very quick delivery and good service. They are lovely. Thank you.
Beautiful! My sister loved it!
"Absolutely beautiful, I love them! Seller was a pleasure, she answered all of my questions promptly. Quick shipping also! Thanks again!"
Earrings are stunning and look beautiful in ears. Very pleased with my purchase!
Beautiful climber set. Simple yet pretty.
"Quality made item. Although, the photo made the earrings look larger than they really are."
Super beautiful and elegant in a really unique way. Just what I was looking for!
"I have been trying to wear earring jackets, and this is the first pair that is easy to put on! I love them!"
Love my purchases from this store!! Fantastic items and customer service. Can't wait to shop again.
"Beautiful earrings, very happy with purchase!"
2 √®me commande chez vous et je suis ravie. Tr√®s belle paire. Je compte faire prochainement une autre commande. Bravo üòÄüëèüèø
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
Tr√®s jolies BO. J'aime leur √©l√©gance et la finesse du travail du fil d'argent. La livraison a √©t√© ultra rapide dans un emballage tr√®s s√©curis√© + un bel √©crin pour les prot√©ger. Merci √† sheilandi pour son professionnalisme.
"Magnifique - si vous avez un cadeau √† faire n'h√©sitez pas : beau produit tr√®s raffin√©, tr√®s bien pr√©sent√© dans son joli √©crin le tout Emball√© dans un paquet cadeau. Je ne regrette pas mon achat mon seul regret s'est de ne pas avoir pris les boucles d'oreilles assorties."
"elles sont magnifiques , envoi rapide et service apr√®s vente super! merci encore"
"Magnifique. Tr√®s belle broche, travail tr√®s fin et √©l√©gant. J'ai pr√©vu de l'offrir √† ma m√®re √† no√´l, je suis persuad√©e qu'elle va l'adorer."
These are clearly hand made- and with utter care! It took for ever for the post office to deliver the items- but that‚Äôs not on the shop... she had them in the mail as soon as she was finished making them.. and when I messaged her for a status update- she was always super quick to reply and provide as much info as she could. The bracelets (I bought two) are for sure worth the wait. She did an amazing job üíï I love love love them!
Im in love with this Ring. Its even better then the photos. Its perfect!!!!
"My bracelet of my father's handwriting is AMAZING!!! Everytime I think of him and miss him, I get to look at this gorgeous piece of talented work. Due to Covid19 it was a couple of weeks before I got it , but she was so easy to talk to and communication was great. Patience was well worth it... You will get a gorgeous piece of art if you order from CozyDetailz!‚ù§"
Really high quality product - I use mine as a key lanyard nd it works/looks awesome. Great response time and follow up from CozyDetails. Would definitely recommend.
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
This is so pretty! The earring fits perfectly in my tragus and the flat back is easy to put it and remove. I requested a custom length and Rosec Jewels was able to accommodate. Very happy with the purchase!
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
"Shipped faster than expected. And it‚Äôs the perfect size! I haven‚Äôt taken it out since I got it. Seriously, my favorite for my rook."
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I will be back!
"These are absolutely beautiful! I have had my eye on these for a while, and I‚Äôm so glad I finally got them. They shipped super quickly too."
"Absolutely stunning pieces of jewelry. My husband & I bought climbers as a birthday gift for my brother‚Äôs girlfriend. She loves opal, & I enjoy being able to find unique pieces for her to add to her collection. She loves them :) They look great on her ears & look so beautiful in the light when they glimmer. Such a remarkable job done on the crafting, in so thankful to have come across your shop. Thank you so much, she also loved the wish bracelet as well. <3 Look forward to purchasing from you again."
"I had seen ear climbers on other ears and wondered how they were anchored if by studs or long wires, I am intrigued but am concerned if the wire hook at the bottom rubs against the back of your ear? I have not tried them on yet but wanted to hear your reply first. I love them; they are beautiful and look well made. Shipping was faster than I expected. Thank you for the extra gift of a wish bracelet and know what my wish/prayer will be!"
Takes a little practice to place them but I love them!
"Tr√®s heureuse de la qualit√© du produit. D√©licat et original ! Toutefois, le temps d'exp√©dition est long en provenance des √âtats Unis. Mais √ßa vaut le peine d'attendre !"
It broke the second day I Wore it...
"Hi, I've read your review and I'm very sorry to hear that you are not pleased It looks like you got a defective item. Sometimes in production mistakes happened. We are sending you a new one asap! Peace and Light, Itai"
"I love this tiny ring! (I did not realize how small it was, but i love it!) I thoroughly freaked out my conservative parents, just a small perk of course. My friends think it's super cute, and it allows me to express myself, experiment with my style, without pain and commitment. I highly recommend! Also it came in a super cute little bag and packaging! If you are questioning it, just DO IT! Believe me!"
"I love wearing dangly earrings, but masks make that cumbersome so I thought I‚Äôd try these...they‚Äôre so cool! Elegant but also a little badass, I love them. Extra credit given for their quick arrival in NY, and I also appreciate the time and resources that were put in to the packaging!"
"Very sweet earrings. I'd read a few reviews about the fit in the ear, but they fit perfectly for me"
"Gorgeous earrings, delivered promptly thank you vey much!"
Really lovely earrings thank you so very much.
Finally got them Nikki & I luv them. They are so light. Well done Cheers Kate
I love this ring! It's great quality and the perfect size for my hand. The ring itself is a little large size-wise but that's okay. I'd rather it be a little big rather than too small. I thought coming from New Zealand to the US would take a really long time. But I got it faster than I got a package from England. Very pleased!
I bought the beautiful ring from Nikki first and was so happy that I asked her to make me the bangle to match for my daughters 21st. I am delighted both with the result and the service offered. I gave Nikki a tight time frame and she hand delivered to make sure the bangle arrived in time for the party. Thanks again Nikki....love it!
"I love it! It was a little big, so it means I can wear it almost on any finger I want :) I like the way you are wearing in this photo, but it is also nice to wear it opposite way. Thank you very much, Nikki, for your patient communication and making it such a special one for me!"
Super merci j‚Äôadore le bijou. Top qualit√© e finisse et vendeur tr√®s honn√™te
Ces petites boucles sont aussi mignonnes que je l'esp√©rais! Isabelle a √©t√© tr√®s rapide car je les ai re√ßues en moins de 3jours! Avec un petit mot et mes initiales grav√©es comme je l'avais pr√©cis√©. Je recommande vivement cette boutique et je ferai s√ªrement d'autres commandes.
"This is exactly what I wanted. It's beautiful and delicate. I wear a rose gold version on my pinky, and a silver version on my ring finger. And the combination looks great. Thanks, Isabelle. ps. for the look and quality of this ring, I have to say a special thank you for making the price really affordable. I saw one exactly the same in a shop in Paris - the asking price was EUR85 (!)"
"Article tr√®s joli ! De tr√®s bonne qualit√©, n‚Äôh√©sitez surtout pas ! Et la vendeuse est AU TOP ! Tr√®s gentille et tr√®s r√©active, je vous recommande vivement sa boutique ü•∞"
I love it! Beautiful quality and I receive many compliments on it.
"Very pretty and classic , a good buy!"
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
My wife absolutely loves her new ring! We upgraded her wedding ring! It's better than expected! It's beautiful & perfect! Thank you! Scott
Wow these earrings are so unusual. Great buy!
Sehr filigran. Aber genau wie abgebildet.danke
Lovely earrings. Well made. Shipping hiccup but seller responded promptly.
"I fell in love with Harry Mason‚Äôs jewelry several years ago in San Francisco at the shop on the pier. I continued to purchase pieces online after my visit to San Francisco. I was very sad to learn of Harry‚Äôs passing, but was thrilled to find you here on Etsy keeping Harry‚Äôs dream going strong. These earrings are beautiful, and very well-made, as expected. This is fine, unique jewelry that always scores compliments whenever I wear any of his pieces."
My first pair of ear climbers! Amazing and so comfortable to wear!!
This is a beautiful piece of jewelry. I love the length. I received it within 2 days of ordering
Just WoW !!! Amazing . And I‚Äôve NEVER gotten anything this fast ! Customer Service was like dealing with my own family ! I‚Äôve been a fan of Harry Mason & these won‚Äôt be my lasts ones !! Thank you !!! I‚Äôm sure Harry is very pleased with the job you are doing ! God Bless !
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them. Shipping was super fast by the way, well impressed! I highly recommend getting something from UrbanRaven, you can tell she makes her jewellery with a lot of love. :)"
"Even more beautiful in person! This is a gift for my mother's birthday, and I wouldn't have bought a special gift from anyone else. Everything is top quality, unique, and we'll made. This is my jewelry store!"
Got the opal ear jackets for my wife & she loves them. Made a perfect Valentine's Day gift. Shipping was on time & gift was wrapped up in a cute bow that helped me out w/the whole Valentine's Day thing. Will definitely order from again. Highly recommend.
Beautiful earrings that can be dressed up or down. The seller is a pleasure to deal with. Fast delivery. Highly recommend!!
These earrings are amazing! They are so well-made and well worth the price. I've already received numerous compliments.
"Shop owner was great with communication. She shipped my item very quickly, and packaged it where it was safe from damage. Her personal touch to the box was cute! The earrings I bought were as pictured."
LOVE THESE! Sooo CUTE!! Thank you!!! :o)
Beautiful!!
"Beautiful, these work great with my work wardrobe, and add a lot. I love the design."
"These are beautiful earrings, but the wire is slightly larger than a standard earring gauge, and so they‚Äôre painful to wear. I‚Äôd hoped these would be an everyday staple in my wardrobe, but I‚Äôll be saving them only for special occasions instead because of the discomfort caused."
"Great quality, beautiful design and quick service. Absolutely love my order!!"
Absolutely stunning and of good quality! Shipping was fast.
"Perfect! They are on the bigger side so be wary of little ears, but my roommate loved them. So glad I got these!"
Came rose gold. Fit my ears nicely. Absolutely love how they fit my personality and interests.
I‚Äôm in love with these! They‚Äôre exactly as pictured and just the right dainty size to make them perfect for every day wear. Definitely recommend!
the earrings weren't only on time but they were so beautiful and perfect! I love wearing them with my floral glasses because they pair so perfectly together.
I am absolutely in love with these earrings! The rose gold makes the crystals even more lovely. They are very light weight and are so easy to wear. I feel so pretty wearing these earrings!
I LOVE ITTTT. I got it for my sister. Very beautiful. Shipped out pretty fast imo. I asked them to draw a stickman with a butt AND THEY DID IT BEAUTIFULLY. Still can‚Äôt stop laughing thank you so much! Definitely purchasing from you guys again :)
"The earrings were lovely, good quality and arrived well and quickly through the post. Good communication from Abi re delivery so really happy with my purchase. They fit and stay climbing up my ear really well. Will buy from her again."
"LOVE these. Ordered as a gift for my sister, but now I need some for myself. Hand made, great shape and fit. Came in lovely packaging too."
very nice earrings. Quick to arrive
"So so happy with these! Beautiful rose gold colour that go with anything I wear, sit really comfortably and I've had many a compliment whilst wearing. Super quick service would highly recommend. Thank you"
"ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!! They sparkle, excellent quality, they are lightweight, and iloniti was a pleasure to work with!! 10 out of 10 would shop from her store again!! I can‚Äôt wait to wear these on my wedding day üåüüåüüåü"
"Incredible. Absolutely breathtaking , and photos just don‚Äôt do these earrings justice. The sparkle is gorgeous, and rose gold is perfect! I had been these in my cart for months, and finally just decided to buy them, and I am so glad I did. Worth every cent. They will make the perfect statement for my jewelry on my wedding day. I cannot thank iloniti for her beautiful craftsmanship!!!"
I‚Äôm going to look so glam and fashionable thanks to these earrings! Even my fianc√© was wowed by them! Very lightweight so your ears won‚Äôt hurt by the end of the night and it comes with an adjustable piece for the climber part. You won‚Äôt regret buying this for your day!
Bought them for my wedding. Absolutely stunning. Got so many compliments for the earrings. Thank you!
LOVE THESE! Sooo CUTE!! Thank you!!! :o)
Beautiful!!

"Love, Love, Love them. I love color and jewelry, so to get two things I love in one piece of jewelry, is a win, win in my book. Very satisfied, Thanks Jess jewelry dreams."
Beautiful earrings! They are super sparkly and I've gotten many compliments on them! Plenty of room to loop through my ear and twist up. I did need to squeeze a little as instructed for my little lobes.
Absolutely gorgeous earrings.. amazing quality. Lovely colours so so beautiful! Can‚Äôt fault at all. Would deffo buy again
Great communication. Amazing quality items. I order some stars and they are so unique! I‚Äôm obsessed!
Merci Livia pour cette cr√©ation. Il est tr√®s beau et rend tr√®s bien dans ma salle de bain!
Je l'aime beaucoup! Je recommande !
Excellent way to keep organised with all my stud earrings. Arrived on time.
I wear these in my first love. They are beautiful and fall in exactly the right place. I bought a total of three sets of earrings from this seller (all pictured in my lobes). These are the perfect combination of sparkle and opal. I‚Äôve showered in them and worked out in them but they have no turned green. The backs fit securely and I never feel at risk of losing the earrings. I love these so much. I‚Äôll definitely purchase more from this seller.
"These are so dainty and sophisticated! They match my other earrings perfectly. I'm glad I shopped with Sami. Quick USPS delivery too! I got gold hoops from her shop too (pictured), they look lovely together :)"
"Exactly as pictured and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôve bought a few pairs off Etsy and they‚Äôre always way bigger than pictured and these are so pretty and they fit my ear perfectly. I have them in my second lobe piercing, pointed towards my arch and it looks so nice. I‚Äôll probably buy from the seller again."
"I ordered this item to put my second-hole piercings to use and loved these as soon as I saw them. I also started wearing rose gold jewelry recently like rings and necklaces so I wanted to add a little something extra to my everyday look (super casually styled gal here üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) over all, I love them and the quality of the rose gold itself is amazing just as well as the opal and jewels. 10/10 would recommend"
"Gorgeous, good quality and unique, just as I've come to expect from ShlomitOfir. Thank you so much."
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."
Je suis ravie ! La commande a √©t√© exp√©di√©e en 24h et est arriv√©e en environ 15 jours. Les boucles d‚Äôoreilles sont parfaitement conformes √† la description et correspondent tout √† fait √† ce que je souhaitais ! Je vais d√®s √† pr√©sent ajouter d‚Äôautres articles dans ma wishlist pour une future commande !
"Wow. I have bought silver hoops before, but these blow them all away. They are SO well-crafted and beautiful! Not too heavy for my delicate earlobes and totally hypoallergenic! The clasp is one of the best--it snaps right in place, without wobbling around and clicks right into it's matching latching hole (I purchased some white gold hoops that didn't have such craftsmanship). These are my new favorite earrings. They look beautiful and I love the cubic zirconia ornamentation that's perfectly delicate. The earrings were so well packaged and included a silver-polishing cloth. I'm in Chicago and it took a good while to get them from Germany during the pandemic, but they were worth every second of the wait. The seller is extremely kind and accommodating--she takes obvious pride in her craft. Will buy from her again!"
Als ich diese Ohrringe sah war es Liebe auf den ersten Blick <3 Ich liebe Fr√∂sche und deswegen mussten diese putzigen Racker bei mir einziehen. Sie sind sehr sch√∂n gearbeitet und sehen sehr hochwertig aus. Der Versand ging super schnell und der Kontakt war unglaublich toll mit der lieben Anja. Danke daf√ºr! <3
"Ganz liebevoll gestaltete, hochwertige Schmuckst√ºcke! Selbst in der Verpackung und den Infos zu den einzelnen Teilen (inklusive Silberputztuch) steckt Arbeit dahinter. Der Versand war flott und auch der Kontakt total nett. Bestelle bestimmt wieder ü§© Vielen Dank!!"
"I have a confession to make. I bought this ring for myself. And yes it did take time getting to me. But I freaking love this ring. It is so cute. It fits on my ring finger, and is durable. Important thing in the life of a barista."
"Tr√®s satisfaite de mon achat ! Tr√®s bonne qualit√©, envoie plus que rapide et le petit cadeau en plus, l'emballage, Jo√´lle est parfaite, on a juste envie de commander √† nouveau ! Merci ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Je les adore - le petit colibri est ravissant et les boucles se mettent tr√®s facilement - je reviens r√©guli√®rement dans la boutique de Jo√´lle, et c'est toujours un vrai plaisir - Jo√´lle est extr√™mement attentive et bienveillante, et ses bijoux sont d'excellente qualit√©, tr√®s jolis et d√©licats !"
Les boucles d‚Äôoreilles sont tr√®s jolie et ont √©t√© livr√© rapidement !! Je recommande !

Earrings as expected! The posts on the jacket part actually allow me to make it a teeny bit higher or lower on my ear as well as a little left or right which I really like. They fit my lobe as expected and they're nice and shiny :) Hoping the shine lasts!
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! The backing has sizing to fit various sized earlobes. These are my new go-to earrings.
The earrings are beautiful and I can tell the seller puts a lot of effort in their work! Shipping took longer than expected but that was because of covid.
Obsessed with these! They hug my ear perfectly and are so unique. I get compliments on them all the time!
Love these! My first pair of ear crawlers :)
"tr√®s bien et bonne qualit√© , merci"
These earrings are beautiful but unfortunately too large in width for my ears. One earring fell out within a couple hours of putting them on for the first time. Maybe better for those with thicker earlobes (the earring width is about 6mm).
Great item! Quick service! Great seller!
"I really love this earring! It‚Äôs a little smaller than I expected based on the photo, but it worked out really well with my other piercings. I also thought it would jiggle a bit, but the wire allows some movement while keeping it from flopping around. The only downside is waiting for shipping from Bulgaria to the states which took 18 days, but it was worth it."
I do really love this piercing and the shipping was super fast but I have a little problem with it. Sometimes the opening (the part you twist to open it) gets stuck inside my nose (pierced part). I found out that taking a shower and gently turning it gets it loose but it still makes me anxious sometimes and I really freaked out the first time! Everything else about the piercing is great tho and the quality is good. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I waited a while to review to see how the material would hold up in showers and omg I love so so much. Looks as good as new and the style is so different. Get this! üòç
I just received my order in the mail & let me just say thay seeing my order in person makes me want to purchase everything from her! HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING FROM HER. üíï I ordered 7mm. the hoops hug my nose like I love and aren't too big! ü•∞
I LOVE THESE!!! They are beautiful just as described will definitely buy again.
these are so cute and perfect !!!
Came in adorable packaging I loved it
"I love them, I did have to put a plastic piece in the back to hold it on my ears, since I have small ears."
These are sooo absolutely fabulous! I get compliments all the time! Thank you! üòä
"Die Ohrringe sind wundersch√∂n und entsprechen dem Bild. Auch die Verk√§uferin ist sehr freundlich. Leider ist hier kein Silber Stempel. Weswegen man darauf vertrauen muss, dass es echtes Silber ist. Nur deswegen gebe ich 4 Sterne (weil ich dahingehend schon schlechte Erfahrungen hatte..jedoch nichtig Etsy).Nat√ºrlich musste auch Zoll dazu bezahlt werden. Sonst g√§be es 5"
"Zozi is a wonderful artist. She was such a perfect vendor. She answered questions in regard to custom modalities right away and had a lot of good tipps. The earrings are just as beautiful as described and the wrapping was so tasteful as well, that it was already a joy to open the package. Thank you again Zozi - I can highly recommend buying your art! :)"
Amazing!!! Beautiful work:)
"Wonderful little earrings! They are well crafted and fit perfectly. I will definitely be buying other styles, I get way too many complements not to!"
"Great ear climbers, not the same cookie cutter look as so many - the design is wonderful!"
"I love this ear climber, perfect fit and nicely designed."
I love these ear climbers! They are a great quality product and the maker put a nice touch on the delivery! I'll definitely order again from this shop! Thank you!
"I absolutely love this climber; I get compliments on it all the time! Over the years I have somehow lost it and replaced it twice (TOTALLY on me) and would buy it again in a heartbeat. Sasha is wonderfully helpful and accommodating, and is just lovely to communicate with. I really appreciate the effort and care she puts into connecting whenever I make a purchase. Definitely buying more of her beautiful pieces in the future!"
"I love this thing so much, I wore it every day until I lost it, now I have it again. Thank you so much!"
The perfect climber! It hugs my ear snug and doesn‚Äôt slip down. This piece is a sure eye catcher. I wore it today and was complimented twice. I love Sasha‚Äôs work so much. Her design skills are as great as her gold smithing. *shipping was quick and her packaging is so great. I can‚Äôt praise her enough!
Bought the smaller climber as a helix piercing. Sasha was so helpful with all my questions. I am totally thrilled with it!!
Article re√ßu tr√®s rapidement et de bonne qualit√©. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et les boucles d'oreilles ont √©t√© tr√®s appr√©ci√©es ! ;)
Beautiful earrings! Fast shipping!
"Very dissatisfied the price that I paid for this earrings is to high for such as cheap material that they are made.Besides,they are smaller that in the picture.They look very cheap. No estoy contenta con estos aretes,el precio que pague es muy cara para la calidad de ellos.El material que est√°n hechos es de baja calidad.Los aretes lucen baratos y son m√°s peque√±os que en la foto."
"I am really sorry to read your review and to hear that you didn't like your earrings.Regarding their size: all dimensions are listed in the product description, there is also a picture with the earring worn, to give an idea of the general look. Make sure to double-check to avoid any disappointment!Moreover, please mind that the quality of my jewelery is my priority number one: all pieces are assembled and welded by hand by myself, the gilding is also done in Paris, France. I pay particular attention to each and every stage of the jewelry making, from its conception to its packaging, to make sure the pieces travel safely to its future owner."
Pr√©paration et exp√©dition tr√®s rapide. Merci encore pour le soin apport√© √† l'emballage !! Bon √©change avec l'artisan. Les boucles d'oreilles sont tr√®s belles. J'adore !!

Super cute and good quality!
Perfect little earrings at a great price and quickly dispatched. Thank you!
In LOVE with this !
"I love the way these look in my ears! Very simple and dramatic at the same time. It took a while to get here, but it was coming from overseas, so not unexpected."
"Beautiful, stylish and the purchasing/receiving process was fast and easy."
"Merci, c'est vraiment tr√®s joli et peu commun..."
Love the earrings I ordered. They were shipped and arrived right on time and met all my expectations! And my friends love them because they are so unique! I get asked all the time where I got them and recommend this store!
Absolutely gorgeous and so unique! Be prepared as they did take about six weeks to do you delivered.That was truly my only concern
They are perfect and amazing! Great quality and I love the sparkle! Thank you so much! I Love them. =)
"I really LOVE these earrings. The stones are small and dainty so they are very tasteful, comfortable, pretty. I can't wear all costume jewelry because of allergies to some metals, so I asked Ara about these earrings and was assured these would be okay, and they are great! No problems at all!!! I will certainly be ordering more jewelry from Ara because her pieces are well made and her customer service is great."
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
"Magnifique ! √Ä la bonne taille, r√©sistant, brillant, je suis fan ! Un grand merci !ü•∞"
"I am in love with these ear crawlers! They are very high quality, especially for how little they cost. Super pleased with this purchase, will buy from this seller again!"
I absolutely love!
"Even though the listing title says ""black,"" make sure you scroll down to find a drop-down with finish options. I totally missed this and ended up with silver instead of black. Still pretty (I already had a rose gold version), but not what I had planned."
Got SO many compliments from men and women alike on these. The black catches people‚Äôs eyes. They fit great great and are exactly as pictured. Very affordable too!
"So fun and unique! I love this cool ear climber. It‚Äôs easy to put in, and stays in place. Plus it‚Äôs virtually weightless and easy on the ears, which after years of hoops is a welcome relief! Every bit as awesome as the picture!! Additionally, OtisJaxon provides excellent customer service and super fast shipping."
"So cute! Fast shipping, great quality, and I got compliments on them the first time I wore them! Also great communication about when it would ship."
"Circle one didn't sit quite as securely as the triangle shape in my ear, but I love them nonetheless!"
"I bought a square and a triangle to wear on each ear and it looks awesome! Love them, so unique!"
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
Very professional! The seller privately messaged me about my earrings and shipped them very fast. I had text messages too with updates from the postal service. The earrings themselves are beautiful. Excited to wear them...the case they came in was really nice and professional looking. Their jewelry would make great gifts! Thanks and happy holidaze‚úåÔ∏èüòé
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"tr√®s jolies boucles, elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite merci beaucoup !"
"Beautiful scarf. This seller has a wonderful eye for which material to match with the liberty print. I have bought 3 for gifts (1 for myself!) and they are packaged beautifully, arriving promptly from Brittany. Thank you!"
Livraison rapide. Tr√®s joli snood que j‚Äôai achet√© pour ma fille. H√¢te qu‚Äôelle le porte cet hiver. Je recommande !
"Cette √©charpe est ravissante, tr√®s douce et tr√®s agr√©able √† porter !!! Merci."
"I absolutely love this one-of-a-kind piece! Perfect for the minimalist! Shipping was fast (to Hawai‚Äôi), item is exactly as shown in the picture. It‚Äôs so cute on; I‚Äôm in love with it."
"I really like them but difficult to put on. Hard to see/feel for the required hole on back of jacket. There are three holes and I need the shortest. Trying to hold jacket, post and then put back on with fingernails is challenging. I do love the look tho! Will keep practicing!"
"Wow, they're just like the picture. So wonderfully minimal, you can wear them and match them to any gold jewellery. Or they are just perfect as standalones cause they are still noticeable üåû"
Love all of the jewelry here each time that I have ordered from here it has always been a hit!
After searching high and low for this style of ear rings I finally found them . They are absolutely gorgeous understated style .
I am obsessed with these and they are beautiful. I just want to commend the seller on her great customer service as I had an issue with a different earring and she was quick to send me a new one. Looking forward to making more purchases from her.
"I LOVE !!! Beautiful earrings. resolutely modern . A highlight : the comfort ! I do not like to take off my earrings to sleep. With them no problem, you can sleep with . The ring is almost delicate fine and can be worn alone, it fits any fingers. Very good contact with the seller who is very attentive , kind and spontaneous . A great pleasure. Thank you so much !"
These are really cool and different earrings! I wish they could be made to sit a little closer to my lobes.... there are 3 different settings which probably works for most ears. My lower piercings are all stretched out from my cousins tearing at them when they were babies and toddlers so there is more space than I want. They are really cool though!
Beautifully made- they look expensive (especially for the price) and they shipped fast! Only thing is I wish they were one stone longer! But I‚Äôm a happy camper and will be ordering again.
Fast shipping and well packaged. I contacted the shop to ask for stones with more inclusions in the turquoise if they had it and they picked out a beautiful set that work great together. Super happy
"First earrings I‚Äôve owned like this‚ÄîI love them! The style, stone, and color are lovely. Hopeful for longevity."
So well made and absolutely adorable! The way the posts fit holds the earrings securely in place. I am very happy with this purchase.
Love these hoops!!
Very cool
"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
Magnifique!!! Des coloriages personnalis√©s pour les jeunes invit√©s du bapt√™me de mon fils. La communication √©tait AU top et l‚Äôexp√©dition de la commande rapide. Merci encore !
Mes 2 coloriages lavables sont arriv√©s tr√®s vite et je vous remercie pour votre petite attention dans le colis. Je recommande cette boutique :)
"Commande ultra personnalis√©e ! Un travail de qualit√©, envoi rapide et soign√©. Je suis fan !"
Tres jolie cr√©ation je recommande
"Love them, just not sure how to make them stay horizontal on my ear as an ear climber....they keep falling vertical. any suggestions! I really want them to ""climb""!!"
So cute and well made!
These are amazing. Unique and well made. Thank you
Just love these earrings - so different. Very well made.
"These look just like the photo and fit very well, too. They also were shipped very quickly and came in a fancy little gift box in a bag. Very classy and a good value."
"Excellent quality, beautifully packaged. I get lots of compliments when I wear these! Really fast shipping to Australia as well."
Beautiful earrings! Quick delivery!
Good everyday earrings. Easy to wear. Thanks!
"Stunning, just stunning. Almost 20 years ago I saw my first ear climber and thought it was the prettiest thing I had ever seen. It has taken me this long to purchase a pair. Again, I'm in love. I will definitely buy more ear climbers! Thank you for an awesome product!"
"These earrings are gorgeous! I find I have to adjust them quite a bit on my ears, but this is only because I have very small earlobes! It does not make me love them ANY LESS!! I will continue to wear them, and they are seriously so stunning on!!"
They look absolutely beautiful!! My girlfriend loved them and when I asked the vendor for tracking as the order took maybe 13-14 days to get here she responded in less than 24 hours. Like I said shipping took awhile but it‚Äôs still 5 stars as usps is fucked right now and that‚Äôs not the vendors fault. Would definitely buy from this vendor again!
The opal earrings are gorgeous! They sparkle so much! I will definitely buy more!
The jackets were a gift for my daughter. She loved them!!!
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
My wife absolutely loves her new ring! We upgraded her wedding ring! It's better than expected! It's beautiful & perfect! Thank you! Scott
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"It was love at first sight just on the picture and the day I put it on my finger I knew it would be forever!!! The design is so unique, and yet so comfy to wear on any fingers. I receive compliments all the time. I call it my Wonder woman ring and I have already asked Cinzia the designer to craft a matching cuff bracelet!!!"
"WOW, WOW, WOW! I am so blown away by this beautiful ring. While I thought it was beautiful in pictures, to see it in person you can appreciate how wonderful this ring truly is. I plan of featuring it on my IG page soon. Im the meantime, it deserves more than the 5-stars that Etsy allows, which is definitely well deserved and plan to follow this store closely to see what other treasures I can add to my ring collection."
I received this beautiful hand-made pendant from the Sacred Valley of Peru right & on time. I couldn't be more content. This is a wonderful piece crafts(wo)manship if I have ever seen one. The pendulous malachite cabochon sits in a sturdy yet delicately designed bezel setting. The brilliant green stone is securely cradled all around in a ribbon of sterling silver. At the back of the piece there is a significant window that allows for the natural patterns of concentric circles with varied hues of greens to be appreciated. It lays flat on the skin and is very comfortable. The front of the piece is simply magnificent. The shape of the stone echoes the fluidity of the dense bands that create a complexity of color deep within the stone-- hues ranging from forest green to a dark moss. There is even a swatch of Drury crystal naturally
"I LOVE my ring! From beginning to end, Cinzia was a delight to 'work' with! There was lots of friendly communication, including picture updates. Her work is exceptional as you can see by the final product in this picture. She paid particular attention to detail - sizing, patina, etc. - all of which was greatly appreciated! And shipping - all the way from Peru - was fast and efficient! Overall, this was an excellent transaction. I highly recommend!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Parfait, je n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande."
"De tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles, toutes en finesse, j'en suis ravie ! Par ailleurs, elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite. Merci beaucoup et tr√®s bonne continuation !"
Took a month to get to me in Seattle. I didn‚Äôt realize how short the chain is. Almost a choker.
"Hi Mark, International shipments are sometimes long, I'm sorry! For the length of the necklace, I sent you the one you chose ... Kind regards, Jessie"
J'ai achet√© ce bijou pour ma maman. Je suis tr√®s heureuse du r√©sultat. Le collier est encore plus fin et d√©taill√© que ce que j'attendais. Il est magnifique! Ma maman en est tr√®s heureuse. Je pense que je craquerai tr√®s vite pour un cadeau pour ma petite soeur ou pour moi m√™me. Merci beaucoup ‚ò∫
"This was my second purchase - love those large hair pins as they are perfect for my long hair. The quality is amazing and the natural beauty of the jorm makes each piece unique. Great seller, shipping took time as expected."
"I love them. So light, no tugging on my ears and they look fabulous!! Thank you!! :D"
It took a little longer then expected but when I finally got them I fell in love. The clasps can be difficult to work with but it‚Äôs totally worth it. They look great in my ears.
"sehr sch√∂ne und s√º√üe Ohrringe f√ºr jeden Tag, beim Schlafen st√∂ren sie mich auch nicht Mit dem Verschluss habe ich mir leider sehr schwer getan und dieser wirkte auch nicht sehr stabil. Doch seit ich sie drin habe, hat sich keiner gelockert :)"
"Amazing!! The earrings are super pretty and sturdy enough (types like these tend to break because you have to bend them a little to put in, but these are perfectly intact still). And the shop owners are really helpful : my package had the wrong address but they send another one straight away. Thank you so much Merce and Anna, I've gotten many compliments already! With love"
"Env√≠o rapid√≠simo (la propietaria vino en persona, en Barcelona, debido a la urgencia que ten√≠a mi pedido). Los pendientes son perfectos y de buena calidad, los compr√© para un regalo y fue todo un acierto. Si quieres llevar un trocito de Barcelona en tu d√≠a a d√≠a, no busques m√°s...estos pendientes son una maravilla!"
"Love it! Gorgeous and well made. Shipping did take over a month- not the seller‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs a global pandemic- but just a warning if it‚Äôs a gift. Order early- totally worth it. Thanks!"
They are so beautiful and they fit really well!
Beautiful and fits as described. Thank you!
It‚Äôs a bit small at the top so it‚Äôs tight in the ear. Cute but hard to keep in place.
Such gorgeous earrings - really beautifully made and such pretty designs. Plus they came in pretty packaging with a cute note. Thanks Ohana!
I love this earring. I wear it pretty much constantly and it doesn't irritate my piercing at all. I'm glad it has two holes so you can choose the size based on your earlobe - I use the smaller size.
"Bellissimo, regolabile in altezza! Ottima qualit√†!"
"Dainty and elegant, and I love that you can wear it a few different ways! Seller was so nice to work with."
"I ordered these Hammered Matte Sterling Silver and they fit my ears that have never worked with climbers before fit in 13.5mm perfectly! I'm amazed how they fit so well and I just guessed that length. I think I'm going to order them a tiny bit longer in matte, I got another pair in matte & they're gorgeous! Definitely recommend!"
"On the good side. They were an absolutely adorable design! Came in a great package. Very thoughtful touches! Sadly, even though these are titled as being precious metal, sterling/14k (which I have worn my entire life, with no issue) in the description. They immediately irritated my ears, like lesser quality metals, always have. I tried to give them a chance, but my ears ended up so irritated, they became too painful to wear. After a few more attempts, I had to throw them away, and bought a sterling silver pair from another vendor, and have not had issues. Great little earrings! Just make sure you don't need proper precious metal, and you will love them!!"
"Love my climber earrings in both gold and silver! Delicate, but the hammered effects really refract and throw the light beautifully! Fast shipping, too. Thank you. Highly recommended."
"So simple, pretty and unique. Takes a minute to figure out how to put them in the first time, but it's simple enough. Love them!"
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!

These ear crawlers are so beautiful and really comfortable! I like them so much I ordered more pairs in different colors! Communication was great and shipping was fast. They also were packaged nicely. I can't say enough good things!
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I will be back!
"Beautiful earrings, my girlfriend likes them."
"Absolutely in love with this ring, it‚Äôs so beautiful and bright. It fits perfectly. It came right when I expected it would. 10/10"
When I say wow I mean WOW! This ring is so freakin beautiful and worth the wait it took to get to me. Not enough adequate words to express my love for it! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I rings arrived today! They are beautiful and they fit perfectly. My husband loves it too! Thank you Dari, I have been looking for these rings and I even asked the jeweler in the middle east who made our wedding rings to make me a set like this but he doesnt know how to make the red line inside. I'm very glad about these rings! They also arrived in a very. Ice box and separate pouches."
"Super cutes et d√©licates, J‚Äôadore cette nouvelle paire de boucles. Elles semblent solides et sont bien r√©alis√©es.‚ù§Ô∏è Elles sont aussi estampill√©es üëç Julie est une tr√®s bonne vendeuse √† l‚Äô√©coute et disponible pour r√©pondre aux questions. Mon colis s‚Äô√©tait perdu dans la poste et elle a √©t√© prompte √† trouver une solution ! Je recommande √† 100%. Julie m‚Äôa propos√© de remplacer les clous car la paire que j'avais re√ßu √©taient trop fines. :/ Une super communication, je double-recommande!! 5+"
I am a huge jewelry fiend and a person I know is a jewelry designer and she was one of tons of compliments on this necklace‚Äôs uniqueness and quality. And I love that the seller offers to replate the piece for a low cost if I need it. I am allergic to nickel and have worn this multiple times since purchase and no issues or rashes. Truly one of my new favorite daily and dressy pieces! I got 16‚Äù and the length is perfect for me! Thank you SO MUCH for making me look good!
"So beautiful. Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the customer service was totally amazing; they sent me sample rings to help me find the best ring-size and took the time to make sure everything was right ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This ring is so perfect despite how teeny it is!! (I know tiny little rings are harder to make) but yet this is PERFECT!!! Love it so much, couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better buying experience"
J ai bien re√ßue ma commande et je suis tr√®s ravie mes boucles d oreilles sont magnifiques Bonne soir√©e Manuela
"Tr√®s heureuse d'avoir re√ßu ma commande, malgr√© le temps d'exp√©dition rallong√© avec le confinement, Nathalie a √©t√© tr√®s r√©active √† mes messages et tr√®s concern√©e par la bonne r√©ception de ma commande. Je suis ravie d'avoir pass√© commande chez elle, tout est conforme √† ce qui est propos√© sur le site. Je recommande vivement !"
"Article envoy√© tr√®s rapidement dans un emballage ad√©quat. Les boucles d'oreilles sont originales, le seul reproche que je fais porte sur la finition comme la fixation de la perle pas exactement centr√©e, petites traces sur le m√©tal egalement. Sinon ce serait parfait, je sais je chipote un peu..."
"So pretty, I‚Äôve ordered more. I‚Äôve given some to my Galentines and the rest? I‚Äôm not sure yet! Delivery was really quick too"
"I was so excited to receive my order today! I received the (blue) rain cloud earrings. The earrings are beautiful, they come exactly as listed! They even added an extra pair of backings just in case. This shop had amazing customers service! I needed to do a quick address change and they were able to fix that for me with no problems. I even received a very cute, handwritten thank you card! Put a huge smile on my face. I‚Äôll definitely order from them again."
I love these earrings! They are adorable and the perfect size. The shop owners are so sweet and I‚Äôll be buying from them again for sure
"The earrings are the cutest thing ever !!! I‚Äôm in love! And the seller was the nicest, they sent me a hand written note too."
Received my cloud üåß & rain drop earrings today! I personally love them & I feel all those who appreciates forces of nature made into jewelry will love as well. üëçüò∫ .
"Shipped fast, unique look! took some trying to figure how to make the earring work, but looks great once you do!"
it's beautiful and it came just like the picture! I love it! definitely buying more earnings üòç
"Simply gorgeous and as pictured! So happy, I must buy more soon! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Just absolutely gorgeous !!! Love the 3 stone ear climber !!!
"Really beautiful, well made, and exactly as pictured. Dainty and edgy at the same time. It can be manipulated a bit to fit the curve of your ear. Am wearing it right now and I love it! Highly recommended seller and item!"
These were exactly as pictured and I have gotten compliments every time I wear them!!
Aprieta bastante . Complicado de poner
"Beautiful minimalist earrings for every day! Exactly as described, fast shipping. Thank you"
"As pretty as I expected, had lots of comments about them!"
These are even more beautiful than they appear in the photos. Love them!
"I get a lot of compliments for these! The chains are flashy without being heavy and the earring stays in place well. Turnover was great, I ordered four pieces and got them within two weeks."
Beautiful!
Superbe boucles ! Tr√®s compl√®te car on ne voit que cela. Donne 1 effet particuli√®rement exceptionnel. Je les porte quotidiennement car elle m'ouvre le visage et l esprit. Beau travail et soign√© et re√ßu avant la date. Merci
So beautiful. Well made. Beautiful stones. They are even prettier in person! Thank you!
I love my eat crawlers. They are so unique! I get complements and comments on them all the time
Absolutely beautiful!!! Exactly as pictured. Will definitely order from you again. ü§ó
I love them and will be perfect for my wedding day :)
"Unique, elegant, beautiful earrings ! Exactly what I was looking for. Arrived on time and professionally made. Definetely recommended. Thank you ! üòä"
"They're really pretty! I should've checked my ear measurements before purchasing these though, the space I got where these should go is smaller/differently shaped than the models. I am able to put them on and after a bit of a struggle get them to stay somewhat where they should be, but it's quite noticeable that they're not really made for my ear-shape. With that said they have stayed put for the 2 hours I've had them in, and they are comfortable. The shipping took quite a bit longer than it normally would, but that I will blame the pandemic for. Thank you!! :)"
"I actually reordered these because I lost my last set and loved them so much. They‚Äôre really comfortable and great for everyday wear - they don‚Äôt have posts to dig in to your neck, no hoops to snag in things. And sooo pretty!!"
"I'd had my eye on these for a long time and I'm so glad I finally ordered. Shipped on time. Wrapped in lovely, minimal, nearly plastic-free packaging. Loved the ribbon pull on the envelope - clever and cute. The earrings are beautiful; delicate, yet sturdy enough that I'm not worried about them breaking. They're just as I hoped they would be."
"Love, love, love. This pair is well made, unique, BEAUTIFUL, versatile, chic and sexy! Leave it to the French! It's everything a woman can ask for! It's great for work and for play. I have gotten compliments everywhere. The fact that it's got both silver, gold AND ROSE gold tones on it means it gets a lot of mileage in the my wkly rotation. Will be sharing the name of the shop next time I'm asked! This was shipped FAST w/tracking and packaged ready to gift. SUPER PLEASED. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SHOP!!!"

"This shop is the bomb. I ordered these in gold, and they accidentally sent silver. I contacted them, and let them know the silver was ok - it was still pretty. I thought they would just refund the price difference. But they sent me a gold pair on the spot! I'm so grateful that they did, the gold is so so so gorgeous. Highly recommend this shop."
These came in today and I absolutely love them! perfect size and gorgeous! Will definitely order from this shop again!
Came early. Fits nicely. Beautifully made. Constantly getting compliments on these earrings. Would gladly purchase from this seller again.
Deuxi?me bijou achet? chez Bubble box et encore super contente!
"The earrings were lovely, good quality and arrived well and quickly through the post. Good communication from Abi re delivery so really happy with my purchase. They fit and stay climbing up my ear really well. Will buy from her again."
"LOVE these. Ordered as a gift for my sister, but now I need some for myself. Hand made, great shape and fit. Came in lovely packaging too."
very nice earrings. Quick to arrive
"So so happy with these! Beautiful rose gold colour that go with anything I wear, sit really comfortably and I've had many a compliment whilst wearing. Super quick service would highly recommend. Thank you"
"Wonderful little earrings! They are well crafted and fit perfectly. I will definitely be buying other styles, I get way too many complements not to!"
"Great ear climbers, not the same cookie cutter look as so many - the design is wonderful!"
"I love this ear climber, perfect fit and nicely designed."
I love these ear climbers! They are a great quality product and the maker put a nice touch on the delivery! I'll definitely order again from this shop! Thank you!
"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus"
"Love, love, love. This pair is well made, unique, BEAUTIFUL, versatile, chic and sexy! Leave it to the French! It's everything a woman can ask for! It's great for work and for play. I have gotten compliments everywhere. The fact that it's got both silver, gold AND ROSE gold tones on it means it gets a lot of mileage in the my wkly rotation.

I absolutely love my custom rings that I had made to fit my college ring. Shop owner was very responsive throughout the short process and the end result is nothing short of amazing! I will definitely be coming back for any future creations and recommend to everyone.
"Great little pendant! Very high quality. Everything about this purchase was excellent...great communication, it was custom made for me in record time and delivered earlier than expected (for my wifes birthday)...and I'm in Australia too! Very highly recommend Reubens Jewelry. Brilliant."
"I can't thank you enough for making my special order absolutely PERFECT. My daughter had her heart set on a rose gold, lowercase, cursive letter ""a"", and she got the best quality it could be. Thank you!"
Beautiful ring! Very dainty with just the right amount of sparkle. Great communication and customer service!
"Sehr entz√ºckende Ohrstecker! Ich habe schon lange nach passenden Perlenohrringen gesucht und hier nun endlich f√ºndig geworden. Mit den Katzen√∂hrchen perfekt, als w√§ren sie f√ºr mich designt. Ganz liebevoll verpackt :))) Ich bestelle gerne wieder!"
"Absolutely in love with these! So, so cute in person and very comfortable to wear."
"Ravie de mon achat. Ravissantes BO, d√©licates et l√©g√®res. Un must have!! Livr√©es dans un joli pochon en tissu."
Livraison rapide. Vendeuse √† l'√©coute et tr√®s r√©active. Les BO re√ßues sont tr√®s jolies et conformes √† ce que j'attendais ! Merci :)
"Shipped fast, unique look! took some trying to figure how to make the earring work, but looks great once you do!"
it's beautiful and it came just like the picture! I love it! definitely buying more earnings üòç
"Simply gorgeous and as pictured! So happy, I must buy more soon! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Just absolutely gorgeous !!! Love the 3 stone ear climber !!!
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are
The seller was very prompt at shipping. Let me tell you the ear cuffs are gorgeous and I would definitely recommend this shop for anyone. I was very skeptical as to how a simple lobe clip will hold entire cuffs weight onto ear. I had lot of problems keeping ear cuffs in position. These cuffs are light in weight and clip on lobe holds everything in place. Love it
to say I'm obsessed with this climber is to undersell it. I love it so much. I have a lot of metal sensitivities and I've been wearing this for two days with no reactions. Worth the wait for international shipping!
"I love, love, love the feather ear climbers. They're exactly as pictured, and they're the right size for my ears. Shop owner was pleasant to deal with, and it took less than three weeks for them to arrive at my doorstep. Highly recommend."
These are now a new favorite pair. I love them and have worn them nearly every day! Thankyou!
"As picture, timely delivery seeing as it came half way round the world. Quality earrings."
"Wow! Your bold, unique bracelet is an amazing piece! I LOVE it! A rugged artisan look that's tempered with just enough elegance to be feminine. And your listing description didn't mention the clever extension that ends in a tiny brass triangle, but what a brilliant touch! The counter-weight keeps the main triangle on TOP of your wrist instead of dangling below where you can't see it, and it feels delightfully sensuous as it brushes against your wrist. This is the first ""single decoration"" bracelet I haven't had to ADD a counter-weight to. Why don't other artists think of this detail? So glad you did! Thanks! Dalene"
"Gorgeous! These are stunning, and I have received many a compliment on them - so I pass it on! Plus, the shipping was really fast, a plus when you are waiting for such treasures. Thanks!"
Super unique and 100% gorgeous-I‚Äôm a happy girl!! Thanks Bunnycone Designs‚ù§Ô∏è
Gorgeous oxidized sterling silver earrings from an amazing artist and silversmith who sent them to me in record time; the earrings are even more beautiful than the photos (and the photos were great!). Thank you so much!
"I would wear this pair of earrings all the time, all day long if it were solid gold. Got compliments all the time, very well made. Beautiful item! I love it! Received much earlier than promised - in short, highly recommend this seller. No worries, you will be happy with your purchase. I will definitely buy again from this seller."
"These earrings are gorgeous, got compliments immediately. Very well made, love the texture of the finish. And great customer service from Peris, the first pair got lost in the mail so he very kindly sent another pair!"
TOP! Really nice artistic design. Accentuates the shape of the earlobe (two fitting points - so adjustable to different ear sizes) and curves nicely around it. Would definitely buy again. :-D
Beautiful earrings!
My 2nd order from this shop and still so impressed! Packaging is chef‚Äôs kiss! My free gift and handwritten note were amazing. Loveee these earrings! I will wear them every single day.
"Such a sweet seller and the earrings are beautiful, too! I got them today and from what I can tell they are sturdy and stays put on my lobes (small wars, so usually its a different story). I can't speak for the wear and tear, but I'll be putting them to test."
I love the cluster earrings..so cute and dainty but make enough of an impact for everyone to give me compliments.. high quality.. fast processing and shipping.. and i loved the extra special touch of the wrapping and the extra gift. Definitely will be a return customer xoxoxo
"These are stunning - simple but bold at the same time. They look exactly as shown online. Also, the seller was kind of enough to include a free pair of earrings and a little necklace. It was such a pleasant surprise; I will definitely be buying more from this shop!"
I absolutely LOVE these earrings! Sparkle with a little spunk!
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I wore these for my wedding and they were absolutely stunning. Packaging and quality of the earrings was perfect. And they were very comfortable!
I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
I bought this necklace just for this outfit and it is perfect. High quality too.
"Beautiful piece of jewelry! It arrived much sooner than I expected and is great quality! The chain length is perfect, and the chime ball produces a beautiful sound. It's exactly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier with it!"
"Love love my dangle red earings. I purchased them as an after thought when buying a necklace (which I love too) anyway, it turns out that the earings are now one of my go to pieces of jewelry. I'm favoriting this shop."
"Bola tr√®s joli et conforme aux photos (pendentif plus gros qu'attendu dans la mesure o√π il enveloppe le grelot). Livr√© dans une jolie pochette organza, qui elle m√™me est gliss√©e dans une petite pochette cartonn√©e (en plus, c'est √©cologique). Envoi extr√™mement rapide (exp√©di√© le jour de la commande !) et tr√®s bonne communication. Je recommande √† 100% !"
"The ring is so delicate and the raw crystal is beautiful. I did not measure my finger size correctly, so the ring is a little too big BUT I wear it with another band that is the right size and it holds the ring on just beautifully. I wear it every day. Seller also included a bonus gift of an obsidian point key ring, which was above and beyond as freebies go, but I love it. (Since I'm not going anywhere these days, I took the crystal off the key ring and wear it as a necklace!)"
Love it! It‚Äôs a great design. I see myself coming back to this shop many more times in the near future! I love the creativity and I‚Äôm more than pleased to have found this shop even more exciting is the fact that it‚Äôs a Canadian shop and pretty close to my city. I love supporting small town Canadian Businesses and will spend more money at local shops than at international ones..Thank you so much And I have to say you will definitely have my business again! The seller went above and beyond with my order including so many amazing extras!! Including extra industrial barbells.. I love your designs! Last thing I had to make sure a mention is the very fast shipping! Once thanks so much!!
This is a wonderful product! Even though I was expecting more of a thinner crescent moon shape I am still very pleased with it. Depending on what type of lighting it catches the color changes. Also the customer service was top notch! I wanted to make an adjustment to the color of the wiring and Sasha-Lee was able to accommodate the change I wanted. I would definitely purchase this again and also highly recommend this shop. :)
"it‚Äôs so cute and super easy to put in. this is literally the only nose ring that i‚Äôve worn longer than 2 days. super comfortable, i‚Äôd recommend"
"These are beautiful!! They're a gift for my daughter but I'm definitely going to be borrowing these A LOT! They arrived quickly and came in a pair. When trying them on, I had to bend the backs slightly to get them in my ear. I also had to bend them a little to tighten them in position. Because of this reason, I'm a little concerned that the silver may break after repeated use. Regardless, these are beautiful, a must have and a great value!!"
Way better than I thought. I was worried they‚Äôd be too big for my little lobes. They are perfect. Thank you!
"SUPER BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS,FAST SHIPPING,QUALITY AND LOOKS AMAZING, I LOVE IT THANKS! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Earrings are so cute - they look great The post office lost the package and the vendor re shipped the earrings which arrived promptly Thank you for your great service - I would definitely buy from this vendor again
Loveeee them!!!
"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!"
I was shocked by how sparkly these earrings are. The pictures don‚Äôt do them justice. So beautiful and perfect for my wedding. They are comfortable and light weight (which was important to me because I don‚Äôt wear earrings very often). The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.
"Truly beautiful earrings. I saw the photos on this post and wondered if the earrings would look the same on...and I can confirm, they do! They are also excellent quality and clarity. There are 3 different height settings to adjust the ear jacket to your ear size. I wore these for my wedding and highly recommend!"
"These earrings are really light and comfy to wear, plus their shapes are perfect, they suit me well for classy or boho looks. ¬°Much√≠ssimas para estas estrellas, puedo reconocer un trabajo de calidad!"
"Earings are amazing :)))) Super qulity and fast delivery. Thank you, Ohana :))))))"
"Todo perfecto, el producto solicitado, gran calidad, env√≠o a tiempo y bien empacado. Muchas gracias"
Love them üåüüåüüåü they are so cute üíñ
"So beautiful,i love it . So happy for my bday party, just what i want. Thank you for you quick answer ans everything"
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
"Boucles d'oreilles jolies, tr√®s originales, et que je n'ai pas trouv√© ailleurs. J'ach√®te toujours chez Kasolya les yeux ferm√©es, je ne suis jamais d√©√ßue."
2 √®me commande chez vous et je suis ravie. Tr√®s belle paire. Je compte faire prochainement une autre commande. Bravo üòÄüëèüèø
"The earrings are delicate and beautiful and I'm very happy with my purchase. Benitta got back to me in a timely manner with any questions I had, and overall, I'm very happy with my order. I only gave it 4 stars, however, because the of the packaging. The gift box it came in had a blob of whiteout on the inside of the lid, and the box was a bit dusty with marks on the inside as well. It looked rather cheap compared to the actual product itself (the earrings are gorgeous!) so I was a bit underwhelmed. But what I ordered is more important than the packaging it came in, and the earrings look just like the picture, so overall I'm really happy with my purchase."
These are so lovely - delicate and really stylish. I've had so many compliments on them already - thanks!
I love these! So cool and a great statement piece that is both subtle and bold at the same time!
"So cutting edge cool. They‚Äôre a nice easy weight, and well designed."
Earrings were a little small. One side broke whilst trying them on for the first time. But I was sent a replacement straight away! Love them so cute! thanks!!
"I adore these earrings!!! They are officially my favorite earrings. They are more comfortable than I originally thought they would be. The shipping was fast. Also, the packaging is adorable. The little glass vials they come in are super cute!"
"These earrings are beautiful! I receive compliments every time I wear them. They were shipped well within the timeframe estimated, and seller kept me posted along the way - definitely worth the wait. Packaging was cute too :3"
"Love these so much! Please, please make more of your styles in the mini version for us girls/boys with smaller ear lobes! :D Thank you again! :D"
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
"Magnifique ! √Ä la bonne taille, r√©sistant, brillant, je suis fan ! Un grand merci !ü•∞"
"I ordered these for my friend for her birthday. I decided I wanted a pair too. As soon as they came in the mail three days ago, I put mine in and haven't taken out since. A bit tricky to get in the earring holes, but once they're in and adjusted, they're super comfortable! I've gotten a bunch of compliments on them. I'm excited to give my friend hers tomorrow. She's going to love them!"
"I've purchased from VermeilSupplies twice now and won't hesitate to come back. Super fast delivery and everything is high quality for a reasonable price. My purchases from a year ago are holding up well, no signs of tarnishing after a year of wear. Highly recommend."
"Sweet and delicate! These are just as pictured and arrived in a timely way with minimal packaging, which is a big plus in my book. I treated myself to several ear climbers/crawlers and I wanted some new gold ones to go with some necklaces I have and these are perfect. Nice and matte and good quality fashion jewelry that looks more expensive than it is. Great price point and and I would definitely purchase from this shop again."
"Originally bought this for my wedding. They ended up not the same shade of gold as my other jewelry, but are a really fun accessory. They're very cute and i get lots of compliments. Love them, thank you!"
"Oof, I love this earring. I had it in my wishlist for so long and I am very happy that I finally got it. Things to know, the metal is extremely thin and easily bendable. To me, this is a good thing. What I didn't notice from the pictures is that the lobe portion pushes your lobe forward a bit and can look a little unflattering, but it is easy to ever so slightly bend the metal where it needs to go. I also have extremely hard cartilage that gets irritated easily so I was able to make the curve in the top a little wider to accommodate my ear. Last thing to know if it is not wide earphone friendly. The earring will hit the pause button on my raycons, haha! Again, not much of an issue, I just adjust it and I'm good. I've worn them all day (paired with the threader long threader earring to make that asymmetrical look)."
"This is my second pair of these rose gold earring jackets. I love them so much, I wanted a backup pair in case I lose one. The color is absolutely beautiful. They are a sleek, elegant design, and very high quality craftsmanship. Perfect for a variety of styles and purposes. Packaging is lovely, and shipping was really fast from UK. A wonderful purchase!!"
I love this piece of jewelry it‚Äôs unique and gets a lot of attentionüôÇ the first couple times I wore it I realize that I have to keep an eye on it when dawning my Covid mask. I found when I took my mask from around my ear I saw the earring on the ground so I hv to remain conscious that its there - its so light weighted! I just got to be careful n touch my ear now n then to make sure it‚Äôs still there! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too big I did get the large I think the small might be too small but I think I would have the same issue but I love it! thank you. Customer support was great because I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to get the large or the small and I measured my ear as instructed and was advised on the large. A Beautiful piece of jewelryüôÇ
"I wasn't sure how I would like this, but I am not exaggerating when I say I love this earring so much!!! I am a lazy person when it comes to jewelry and always prefer to keep earrings in, then forget about them. While I can't, and definitely wouldn't recommend sleeping with it on, it is always immediately back in my ear once I wake up. I can't recommend this shop/earring enough! Love it!"
These earrings are stunning. Exactly what I was hoping for. Minimal yet visible. I love them <3. The packaging was cute and well thought. Thank you
INCREDIBLY fast shipping/delivery and in the most adorable packaging. Will definitely purchase from this shop again! Thank you!
"Beautiful pair of earrings, will buy more in the future."
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
largento's designs always have been so adorable and waerable!!! this one fits your ear perfectly!
They took a little longer than I thought to arrive and they are a little rough (not fully polished) but quite cute and a lovely blue colour. Cute packaging and good comms from seller
Very beautiful earrings! Very detailed metalwork! Super fast shipping!
"Very nice, thanks. Recommend. AAAAAA*****"
"Love, love, love. This pair is well made, unique, BEAUTIFUL, versatile, chic and sexy! Leave it to the French! It's everything a woman can ask for! It's great for work and for play.

"I just love these. They are well made, came quickly, and meet all expectations. I'll shop here again."
Perfect! They fit great and looked just like I hoped they would!! Thank you!!
The earrings are a wonderful fit! It was packaged well and shipped quickly too.
nice shape and crafted well fast ship
My earrings came exactly as I expected and they are super adorable! I've gotten a lot of compliments on them as well. The shop owner is really nice and helpful and I will definitely be purchasing jewelry from here again! (Also I've gotten several custom orders from here as well and they turned out fantastically!)
"My best friend loves Bucky and Steve, so when she opened her present, she legitimately squealed with happiness. Great quality. Shipping did take a little long, but that was to be expected as I live on the other side of the world."
"THESE ARE SO CUTE! Sorry for yelling, but wow, you make beautiful jewelry and deserve all the flailing and enthusiasm I can give you. I love these earrings, thank you so much!"
They are just as adorable as they looked in the photos!
I am a huge jewelry fiend and a person I know is a jewelry designer and she was one of tons of compliments on this necklace‚Äôs uniqueness and quality. And I love that the seller offers to replate the piece for a low cost if I need it. I am allergic to nickel and have worn this multiple times since purchase and no issues or rashes. Truly one of my new favorite daily and dressy pieces! I got 16‚Äù and the length is perfect for me! Thank you SO MUCH for making me look good!
"So beautiful. Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the customer service was totally amazing; they sent me sample rings to help me find the best ring-size and took the time to make sure everything was right ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Ces boucles d'oreilles sont absolument parfaites. Simples, classiques et l√©g√®res, elles sont d'une tr√®s belle qualit√©. Ce n'est pas mon premier achat chez FemmeMecanique... et ce n'est pas mon dernier! Merci :)"
"This ring is so perfect despite how teeny it is!! (I know tiny little rings are harder to make) but yet this is PERFECT!!! Love it so much, couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better buying experience"
I just received these earrings and have already tried the backs/jackets on with so many different pairs of earrings. They are so versitile. They look especially fabulous with the earrings they came with AND several others I've purchased from this awesome shop. I LOVE this shop! Excellent quality and unique designs! Thank you!
"Just like the other earrings I ordered from this seller, these are so unique! I love them. The fact they can be worn 3 different ways is great. I will definitely be back again!"
"I'm a repeat customer -- Love this shop and its product. Special, quality pieces that I wear every day."
"This has become my favorite place to get ""real"" jewelry. Amazing design (I can't find anything else like it) and quality product (stands up to daily wear). I now (happily) own @ 20 pieces of Virginia Wynne's work."
"I love them soooo much. They arrived earlier than I thought and are soo beautiful. A bit smaler than they appeared on the fotos, but still amazing. I will definately order something from Thaya again!"
"Came in early, has unique packaging, and bring a complimentary ring wipe! It is also very easy to shape to your finger if it doesn‚Äôt exactly fit, 10/10 would recommend!"
my boyfriend and I got these and we absolutely love them! I was worried it may be a little uncomfortable but its not one bit! so so happy!
Took exactly 6 weeks to receive these earrings but finally they arrived safely and I am loving them! Very comfortable- the posts are not too long so they do not poke behind the ear. They fit my lobe better in my second piercing- rather than the first- but that works just as well. I love anything new and different and these are certainly that! Thank you!
"Love the weight and feel of these, as well as how secure the notched posts feel. The gold is very warm and shiny, making the snakiness very subtle, which I love. Now I want them in silver too!"
"My second pair of earrings from this shop, and I doubt it will be my last! I ALWAYS get compliments whenever I wear either pair. The craftsmanship is amazing, as is the shop owners communication. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you!!"
"I love it, such beautiful craftmanship, the sodalitestone is of really high quality and love the little moon and stars on the back of the ring!!! The only problem is that I just want more and more of her jewelry- highly addictive!"
"Tr√®s satisfaite de mon achat ! Tr√®s bonne qualit√©, envoie plus que rapide et le petit cadeau en plus, l'emballage, Jo√´lle est parfaite, on a juste envie de commander √† nouveau ! Merci ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Je les adore - le petit colibri est ravissant et les boucles se mettent tr√®s facilement - je reviens r√©guli√®rement dans la boutique de Jo√´lle, et c'est toujours un vrai plaisir - Jo√´lle est extr√™mement attentive et bienveillante, et ses bijoux sont d'excellente qualit√©, tr√®s jolis et d√©licats !"

Superbe !! Seconde fois que je commande et je suis toujours satisfaite ! Et vendeuse vraiment adorable !
Beautiful earrings! Wonderful craftsmanship and very lightweight on the ears. ŒïœÖœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑœé!
Beautiful! I will be ordering a pair for myself. My neice is going to love them.
"This ear cuff earring is gorgeous! When I first bought it, the cuff part wouldn't stay in place and kept hanging down. I wrote to the seller, and she figured out a solution, by making the back of the cuff adjustable similar to some pierceless earrings. She sent me the new one free of charge, and it's perfect!"
These ear climbers are beauties! Rose gold is my new color and I am lovin these!
Can I give more than 5 stars? This shop is so great! Not only is the jewelry unique and beautiful but the artist is so kind & easy to work with! Looking forward to owning more pieces in the future & telling others about this shop!
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much!
Seller was extremely helpful. These were a gift for my mother and she said they are beautiful.
"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"

"J'adore ! Quelques probl√®mes pour la livraison mais ils se sont r√©gl√©s sans difficult√©s et rapidement. La qualit√© des boucles est remarquable. Je m'attendais √† un plastique mat mais c'est transparent, original et superbe ! Je suis ravie de cet achat !!! Et la monture est tr√®s jolie, bien assortie √† la fleur."
I love all of the earrings I purchased from ClarisseBijoux!
Jolies boucles d'oreilles. Quelques probl√®mes pour la livraison mais ils se sont r√©gl√©s sans difficult√©s et rapidement. Je suis devenue une fan des bijoux de cette boutique !!!
Creative earrings w cute little bee amd I got the gold hive backdrop. Tricky to put in but well worth it! Love them and can‚Äôt wait for the compliments Thanks!!
"I have been looking for the perfect front back earrings to use as a tragus earring for quite some time. I measured before purchasing but was of course still wary it wouldn't work as perfect as I imagined it would and had to remind myself they were awesome normal earrings too......I digress, im in love, they are perfect! Packaged lovely. Shipped in the time frame stated and arrived quickly after shipping."
Beautiful and exactly as pictured. Super easy to put on and take off. A must for anyone wanting a standout pair of earrings. Also loved the sweet packaging it came in.
"These earrings are elegant, well made and uniquely beautiful. I'm so happy to be giving them as gifts. My one bit of feedback is that I wish they came in full gold, as I always associate bees with the color gold!"
I am in love with my beautiful ear climber!! I spent a lot of time looking for a high quality ear climber and I am so happy I found this. It fits on my ear perfectly and stays up all day. Can't wait to buy another!
I went back and forth and bought the one cuff and two studs. Just received them today and should have bought two cuffs and two studs. I‚Äôm in love with these!!
Obsessed!!! üíóüíóüíó
"The pictures on here are amazing but I‚Äôve been eyeballing these for months and finally bought the set. Best purchase I‚Äôve made in a long time, I am a huge turquoise fan and have big plans to wear these ladies out all the time. Turquoise is like pearls, shouldn‚Äôt leave the house without a good piece of turquoise jewelry. I can‚Äôt wait to order from here again."
"As a violinist, pretty dangling earrings are not a feasible option for me. These stay perfectly out of the way and are absolutely lovely. They don't bother my ears like cheap jewelry does. I get comments every time I wear them!"
"These are simple, attractive, and comfortable! Lovely craftsmanship. Unlike ear climbers I have had in the past, these stay in place without pinching my ears or bending in a way that hurts the holes in my ears."
I have very thin ear lobes and these are so delicate can they don't pull at all. Also --The hand hammered gold really glistens.
I have now revived my ear climbers and am in awe of the quality!
The most beautiful ear climbers I‚Äôve ever seen! They‚Äôre so comfortable and very unique!
"The most beautiful ear climbers I‚Äôve ever seen, and they‚Äôre very comfortable! They‚Äôre so unique!"
"Die Bestellung wurde rasch erledigt! Ohrringe waren fein verpackt! Mein Wunsch, den hinteren Teil der Ohrkletterer ein bisschen zu verst√§rken wurde ber√ºcksichtigt. Die Form, die Farbe, das Material - alles sch√∂n. Ich bin begeistert und w√ºrde am liebsten noch welche bestellen, der Versand ist jedoch nicht grad g√ºnstig...aber es wird den Zeitpunkt geben, an dem ich mich wieder belohne :-)"
Love it thank u so much dear really love them ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüôèüèª and I love my little pillow with them ü•∞
"I ordered these beautiful earrings on May 6. After I clicked to purchase, I saw that they were coming from Paris, France--I would not have ordered had I know that. I live in the US. I emailed on May 16 and received word that they had not been shipped but would be soon. As of today I have not received them. The email has been shut down. I cannot find a phone number. Etsy states that I have to go through the website. When I do that, the ""Conversation unable to be sent"" I'm very frustated. I will be following up with my credit card to dispute the charges. UPDATE 6/3/19. Etsy intervened and said my charges would be credited back. This afternoon, I received the package from Paris. It was sent mid May. The earrings are truly beautiful. The packaging was great, wrapped very nicely, with a small satchel included."
"Elles sont juste sublimes ! Un peu plus petites que ce que j'imaginais d'apr√®s les photos, mais vraiment tr√®s belles, de tr√®s belle qualit√© (pas cheap du tout, au contraire !). Elles ont un super rendu, j'adore ! Livraison rapide et emballage impeccable, elles √©taient bien prot√©g√©es !"
One of my favorite pair of earrings! Love them so much
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
Commande re√ßue dans les d√©lais. Tr√®s contente de mon achat. Fait avec beaucoup de minutie.
"I LOVE THESE EARRINGS!!! They are super wearable/comfortable. I work in an office answering the phone much more then I should and these don‚Äôt hurt. I‚Äôve had people ask me if these were designer, stating that they almost bought a pair just like these for a lot more money.... like add a zero."
These are so perfect and
"i love this earring! i have not taken it off since i got it, and i will be ordering an extra one or two so that if i misplace it, i will have a backup. very pleased and love the seller!"
"Love these! I've gotten a lot of compliments on these beautiful, simple earrings"
I kid you not these are 1000% better in person. Eye catching without being over the top. I just got my package today and I love them. They are so comfortable which is hard to find these days (at least for me). Extremely happy with this purchase üíö
I love this Butterfly to death. It's another one of those pieces that I wear around the house just for my own enjoyment.
This is beautiful. Am saving it for when I visit New York and my fianc√© there (as soon as Covid goes away!)
Pretty and sparkling.
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"I love these earrings! They are gorgeous and unique and sooo sparkly! They fit perfectly, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day! These earrings have the clamp on the back for the upper part of the earlobe so if your ears are small or not shaped right these might not fit great. Fast shipping and they were exactly as described. Thank you Iloniti!"
Absolutely gorgeous. She is so helpful and sent me earrings with boxes and bags. These are even more beautiful in person since she uses really great quality stones
Custom made for a really good price. It's larger than I imagined which isn't a bad thing. I think Moissanite and Diamonds may be cut a little different which makes the Moissanite larger in diameter than a diamond. It's so pretty and it arrived way faster than I expected. I have no doubt my forever ring will last forever. Moissanite is very durable like a diamond. My first ring was a moissanite and looks exactly the same as it did when I bought it five years ago. Don't hesitate to buy from this shop!
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
I am so happy I went with this Etsy seller. I LOVE this ring. Had it checked to verify it is 10k and real moissanite. I can‚Äôt stop looking at it and will DEFINITELY be looking for Mother‚Äôs Day and Christmas! Thank you Harshita for answering my many questions also. I am very particular about stone size and having my rings be similar in thickness and width. Pictured is my new eternity bezel set 1.24 ctw in moissanite next to my 2 ct moissanite solitaire ‚ù§Ô∏è I love love love!!!!!
Very professional! The seller privately messaged me about my earrings and shipped them very fast. I had text messages too with updates from the postal service. The earrings themselves are beautiful. Excited to wear them...the case they came in was really nice and professional looking. Their jewelry would make great gifts! Thanks and happy holidaze‚úåÔ∏èüòé
"LOVE these earrings! They are exactly as described and I couldn't be happier with them. My ears are pretty sensitive to the types of materials I can wear, and so far, my ears haven't reacted to the material. Very happy with these earrings!"
My new ear climbers are beautiful!
"Thank you so much! Love the earrings, they are just perfect and fit nicely :) No problem with shipping and great communication with Largentolab. Recommend!"
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
Such a gorgeous pair of earrings! LOVE the nature inspired design with seeds. So delightful and unique. Will be back for more from this shop! üòä
"Malgr√© une petite p√©rip√©tie de transport (une boule d'oreille √©tait cass√©e), le service √©tait tout √† fait au rendez-vous avec l'envoi d'une boucle de remplacement dans la foul√©e. Elles sont tr√®s jolie et semblent de belle facture. Merci"
"J'adore. Boucles tr√®s jolies. L√©g√®res, originales. Elles correspondent √† photo et √† la description. Colis rapide et soign√©. Merci"
"I can honestly say that I wish I knew about this ring and this business when I first proposed to my wife 4 years ago. The quality of the ring as well as the level of care and professionalism displayed by Lena stands miles above the rest. Her communication is nothing if not timely and professional, yet the care she provides to her customers speaks to the core of her character. I can honestly say that any business I have in the future will absolutely prioritize this business. I can not recommend them enough."
"Correggo la mia recensione perch√© sono veramente delusa. Avevo dato 5stelle nonostante avessidovuto pagare ulteriori 6‚Ç¨ Di dogana e attendere pi√π di un mese. Ma gli orecchini non sono in argento 925 come venduti, dopo un mese ininterrotto di utilizzo √® venuto fuori il rame. Davvero delusissima"
"The ring I received from LenaMay jewellery was absolutely stunning. Exactly what I hoped for, in fact it went beyond my expectations. The parcel arrived on time and was beautifully presented. Thank you so much!"
Love! Great quality and super unique. I have gotten compliments on these every where I have worn them.
Really beautiful. Seller was great to make sure these fit correctly. These are really unique earrings. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of compliments already.
I'm very happy with my purchase. The earring are well made and have a unique look. I have gotten several compliments already :)
Love this ear climber-looks so cute-came in a lovely fabric bag and little note!!Thanks
It's all the time fall down
"Hi Romi, I am sorry to hear that you are having problems with the earring. We would be happy to send you another item or to refund your money back to you. Sent you a private message as well. Best regards"
Received in perfect condition. Thank you so much for such a lovely pair of earrings.
Arrived quick and beautifully crafted
"I love it, it fits perfect."
better than expected and I wear it consistently!
Magnifique. Mon coup de c≈ìur !
"I love this tiny ring! (I did not realize how small it was, but i love it!) I thoroughly freaked out my conservative parents, just a small perk of course. My friends think it's super cute, and it allows me to express myself, experiment with my style, without pain and commitment. I highly recommend! Also it came in a super cute little bag and packaging! If you are questioning it, just DO IT! Believe me!"
High quality craftmanship. Just beautiful! They're elegant with an interesting edge. Now my favorite earrings. Perfect.
When I saw these earrings I thought they looked sexy. So I bought them! If you want to make yourself look sexy try these earrings!
Kristina's work is exquisite! I combined these with another pair I bought and they look so avant garde together! Love!
Purchased this set of beautiful and unique earrings for my wife for her birthday. Kristina was awesome to deal with - she was in contact as soon as the order was placed and kept me up to date with everything. She even took the time to gift wrap them for me! I would highly recommend Kristina if you are looking for that something a little bit different but with a touch of class.
I was so excited when I found them! They are so unique! I work for an Ophthalmologist & Optometrist and our patients were complimenting me all day. I just love them. Great size and quality!
Magnifiques et originales. Je les adore et ai re√ßu beaucoup de compliments. R√©ception du petit colis le temps d'un battement de cils ! Merci :D
Enti√®rement satisfaite de ma commande ! Petites boucles d‚Äôoreilles magnifiques destin√©es √† ma petite fille fan de Harry Potter ! Elle adoooorrre les boucles.... L‚Äôenvoi ultra rapide dans un emballage tout en douceur ! Merci de tout c≈ìur et bonne continuation.
"Boucles d'oreilles absolument adorables qui me ravissent au plus haut point ! Elles sont arriv√©es dans une jolie petite bo√Æte toute rose et la livraison a √©t√© extr√™mement rapide. Je suis combl√©e, merci ! :)"
Love! Love! Love! My purchase üòÅ The earrings are beautifully made and look really elegant and stylish. Will definitely be ordering again.
"Thank you so much, I bought these for my wedding and can‚Äôt wait to wear them! Great quality and I love the screw fit for the upper ear which makes the fit perfect and discreet, unlike other versions that use clips x"
I absolutely love these earrings. The quality and packaging is superb. I will definitely be ordering from this vendor again!!!!!
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! i recieved so many compliments. Thank you so much for the quick process and shipping. I‚Äôll definitely will be buying again
This is a beautiful piece of jewelry. I love the length. I received it within 2 days of ordering
"Gorgeous. Everything from Harry Mason studios is gorgeous. FAST! Rec'd before promised date. Packaging was excellent. The staff has always been friendly, professional, knowledgeable. Although Harry has passed, his spirit is in this new outlet via ETSY. Will definitely keep an eye open. Wishing the shop the very best."
Absolutely more stunning than the photo. Super comfortable and makes my ears look like a piece of art. The shipping was super fast. Sorry to hear about Harry Mason's passing. I plan to pass these down to my daughter.
"I fell in love with Harry Mason‚Äôs jewelry several years ago in San Francisco at the shop on the pier. I continued to purchase pieces online after my visit to San Francisco. I was very sad to learn of Harry‚Äôs passing, but was thrilled to find you here on Etsy keeping Harry‚Äôs dream going strong. These earrings are beautiful, and very well-made, as expected. This is fine, unique jewelry that always scores compliments whenever I wear any of his pieces."
Beautiful hand made piece of jewellery. I love my new pendant. It is obvious that it has been made with love and is exactly what I wanted. The seller went to every effort to make this a perfect experience.
"Bague magnifique, r√©alis√©e avec soin et avec le soucis de faire plaisir! Je recherchais quelque chose d unique et originale, tout y est! Quant √† la vendeuse, r√©ponse rapide, agr√©able, gentille, bref le top! Ce ne sera s√ªrement pas le seul achat! Je recommande sur tous les points!"
Elles sont superbes et tr?s l?g?res ? porter ! Merci
"Magnifique paire de boucles d'oreille! Tr√®s originales, on m'en fait souvent le compliment! Je les souhaitais l√©g√®res et Vanessa a respect√© mon souhait: elles ne p√®sent que 2.5g chacune! Merci beaucoup!"
Es precioso. Lo he llevado el d√≠a de mi boda y todo el mundo me dec√≠a lo bonito y original que era. Se ajust√≥ muy bien a mi oreja y aguant√≥ muy bien. Estoy muy contenta.
"super service! gute Qualit√§t! Einfach wundersch√∂n, danke!!!!"
"Wow. I have bought silver hoops before, but these blow them all away. They are SO well-crafted and beautiful! Not too heavy for my delicate earlobes and totally hypoallergenic! The clasp is one of the best--it snaps right in place, without wobbling around and clicks right into it's matching latching hole (I purchased some white gold hoops that didn't have such craftsmanship). These are my new favorite earrings. They look beautiful and I love the cubic zirconia ornamentation that's perfectly delicate. The earrings were so well packaged and included a silver-polishing cloth. I'm in Chicago and it took a good while to get them from Germany during the pandemic, but they were worth every second of the wait. The seller is extremely kind and accommodating--she takes obvious pride in her craft. Will buy from her again!"
"Ganz liebevoll gestaltete, hochwertige Schmuckst√ºcke! Selbst in der Verpackung und den Infos zu den einzelnen Teilen (inklusive Silberputztuch) steckt Arbeit dahinter. Der Versand war flott und auch der Kontakt total nett. Bestelle bestimmt wieder ü§© Vielen Dank!!"
Love them! The only minor issue is that the earring back is not very stable so I have to use other backs to ensure they don't go off by themselves.
"Gorgeous set, elegant and modern. Love it! Thank you!"
Its exactly how it looks
It was a beautiful gift üòò pure perfection üòÅ
I just received these earrings and have already tried the backs/jackets on with so many different pairs of earrings. They are so versitile. They look especially fabulous with the earrings they came with AND several others I've purchased from this awesome shop. I LOVE this shop! Excellent quality and unique designs! Thank you!
"Just like the other earrings I ordered from this seller, these are so unique! I love them. The fact they can be worn 3 different ways is great. I will definitely be back again!"
"I'm a repeat customer -- Love this shop and its product. Special, quality pieces that I wear every day."
"This has become my favorite place to get ""real"" jewelry. Amazing design (I can't find anything else like it) and quality product (stands up to daily wear). I now (happily) own @ 20 pieces of Virginia Wynne's work."
OMG! I used it for NYE party and I got sooooo many compliments for these statement earrings. They look amazing! Thankfully it arrived earlier than I expected and I'm so glad that I was able to wear it. Looks amazing with my dress. Just wow!
"Beautiful jewelry, I initially ordered the ear climber which was stunning but when I tried it on with my dress it wasn‚Äôt quite what I was looking for. I contacted the shop to exchange it for a different pair of earrings, a few days later I received them and they were absolutely perfect! Affordable, yet expensive looking. Can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day, will post picks later :)"
Absolutely stunning! The cuff fits the entire edge of the ear perfectly. Fastening keeps it nice and tightly secured without making it painful or uncomfortable. I absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it on my wedding day. I also love the beautiful little box and pouch to keep it nice and safe. Thank you so much ‚ù§
These earrings are stunning. I spent hours looking for this type of set for an upcoming wedding that wasn‚Äôt too pricey but still quality. These have gone above my expectations and delivered in such a timely manner. I have another wedding coming up and will be ordering a second pair. I cannot wait to wear these.
this earring is super pretty and it shipped almost right away! it came just in time for prom!
"I absolutely love the look of this earring! I went with option D and it is stunning! It is a little uncomfortable in my ear so I probably won't be wearing it for long periods of time, but I'm sure that's just because of my ear shape and has nothing to do with the products quality. Thank you so much!"
Cute! It's not real gold but no allergic reaction which is awesome because my ears are very sensitive. Seller cares about customer's opinions. Recommend them. I got some great compliments at work.
The earings were delivered fast. I got one for me and my sister. We both love it! The earing is easy to put on and really pretty.
"Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day. Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!"
"Totally my favorite earrings. Such s great idea and they look just wonderful. Good quality and everyone always asks about them and compliments them. Finding this product has totally gotten me into looking and purchasing more science inspired jewelry, I love it!"
"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!
Love them! The only minor issue is that the earring back is not very stable so I have to use other backs to ensure they don't go off by themselves.
"Gorgeous set, elegant and modern. Love it! Thank you!"
Its exactly how it looks
It was a beautiful gift üòò pure perfection üòÅ
"Wasn't exactly flush to my ear like I was hoping from the picture, but I was able to move it a bit and adjust it so it was. It's beautiful otherwise! Fast shipping."
Wore these earrings on my wedding day and they were perfect. So beautiful. This is my 2nd pair. I unfortunately lost the 1st pair and I wanted to wear them for a wedding I was a bridesmaid in. I got a lot of compliments on the earrings!
"I love how dainty and unique they are. I got the gold and I'm glad I did. You don't really notice the gold, but I feel it makes the stones pop."
"These are so pretty, I've gotten lots of compliments. If I could do it over, I'd probably go with the post backs instead of the wire, but that's just personal preference. You do beautiful work!!!"
I adore these earrings! I purchased the full moon and crescent moon sets so I could wear one in each ear if I want. Super unique and delicate looking- I will definitely purchase from this shop again :)
came fast and just as pictured!! love them - thank you!!!!
"Love these studs and jackets! There are so versatile, you can wear the jackets with any stud, wear them in front of ear, the list goes on. Have several other pairs of Emerald's jackets and they too are awesome. Go get some!"
Creates a unique look when paired with studs. I love the versatility they give me.
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
"Gorgeous, beautiful earrings!! I am just IN LOVE with these earrings! It‚Äôs everything that I‚Äôve asked for. The seller was very accommodating and very patient with me. This is my second pair of earrings from them and I can‚Äôt recommend them enough! You will not regret purchasing for this shop I promise. I probably will be purchasing more in the future lol ü•∞"
Je les adore!!
So well made and modern. Love how they look!!!
Lightweight and elegant. Lost one earring on day 3 but found it about a week later!
Boucles d'oreilles toute simples mais tellement belles !
I havent received my order????
"I am BEYOND thrilled with this earring! it looks SO good! I actually have the silver one too, this is my second one! It makes me feel so fancy and expensive haha! really good quality and SO pretty! thank you!"
Such good quality!! Irritated my ears a little when I first put them in but it was gone within like 2 days. Always get so many compliments and they‚Äôre such a good subtle statement piece to style with. Looooooooooove
Do not like them the elastic and beads are not enough on the string gets tangled
"I was really looking forward to wearing this set. I‚Äôm writing this review 10 minutes after taking it out of the package. The anklets came in cute packaging, but that‚Äôs about it. The herringbone anklet isn‚Äôt horrible, I just wish it laid a bit more flat. The snake chain on the other hand... as I went to clasp it, the anklet broke in my hand and is now too short to connect. This is the first time I‚Äôve been disappointed with an Etsy purchase, I hope it‚Äôs the last."
These are cute! Can't wait to order more ty üíõ
Its like no matter what color combo you choose they all look good together!!
So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
I absolutely love my earrings! Tina made them exactly how I wanted them. I had wanted to make sure that what I was ordering wasn‚Äôt going to be too heavy & would drag my earlobe down. They are perfect & quite light considering they are crystal. Tina was also very prompt with getting back to me when I enquired about specific details :) They didn‚Äôt take that long to arrive either. Another plus! :)
Very pretty hair comb. I used for my wedding day and was very happy with how it turned out. Beautifully made!
"Premier achat √† la boutique. Contente des boucles d'oreilles , jolies comme sur la photo."
Loveeeeeeeee!
The earrings were just as pictured! And there was even an extra bracelet included. My friend was very happy with this gift. Thank you!
We love these pendants/chains!! We ordered three and only received 2 of the pendants initially. The seller was terrific and sent the third one off immediately. The chain is the perfect length and the pendants are beautiful. Thank you!!
Came in the cutest little box. Well made and very pretty. Perfect for my mom on Mother's Day!
perfectly simple. high quality. received the item in record time!
I bought these for my wife and she absolutely loves them. Minimal but high quality. Highly recommend!
Beautiful earrings. Super fast shipping amd very nicely packaged! :)
They arrived in a timely manner and are beautiful! So comfortable and fit my ears very well! The little glass jar they came in was busted to pieces but there was no damage to the ear pins. Love these! Getting so many compliments on them today!
"I just revived this item. It is fabulous. One thing that I absolutely adored was the packaging. The earrings came in an cute little glass jar with a cork top. It was very adorable. As far as the earrings themselves go, they are awesome, and fit nicely! Flexible enough material to gently bend to fit the ear. I feel like the queen Cassiopeia herself while wearing them. :)"
Took a while for shipping but is very pretty. The packaging was very cute as well - it came inside a tiny little bottle!
Took forever to get here but it was worth the wait. The earrings are beautiful and worth every cent. Super satisfied with my purchase.
I love my earrings! I got silver and gold. I am looking at a few other styles from this shop as well. üòä
"Always great quality, and their shipping is improving! I‚Äôve gotta be on my 8th pair at this point (I don‚Äôt keep up with my earrings very well) but I keep coming back to this pair!"
"Love these earrings. Simple and classic. I was slightly worried about comfort, but that hasn't been a problem at all. Highly recommend!"
Super modern and dainty. Just as pictured.
"Super cutes et d√©licates, J‚Äôadore cette nouvelle paire de boucles. Elles semblent solides et sont bien r√©alis√©es.‚ù§Ô∏è Elles sont aussi estampill√©es üëç Julie est une tr√®s bonne vendeuse √† l‚Äô√©coute et disponible pour r√©pondre aux questions. Mon colis s‚Äô√©tait perdu dans la poste et elle a √©t√© prompte √† trouver une solution ! Je recommande √† 100%. Julie m‚Äôa propos√© de remplacer les clous car la paire que j'avais re√ßu √©taient trop fines. :/ Une super communication, je double-recommande!! 5+"
I am a huge jewelry fiend and a person I know is a jewelry designer and she was one of tons of compliments on this necklace‚Äôs uniqueness and quality. And I love that the seller offers to replate the piece for a low cost if I need it. I am allergic to nickel and have worn this multiple times since purchase and no issues or rashes. Truly one of my new favorite daily and dressy pieces! I got 16‚Äù and the length is perfect for me! Thank you SO MUCH for making me look good!
"So beautiful. Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the customer service was totally amazing; they sent me sample rings to help me find the best ring-size and took the time to make sure everything was right ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This ring is so perfect despite how teeny it is!! (I know tiny little rings are harder to make) but yet this is PERFECT!!! Love it so much, couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better buying experience"
"I am really happy with these earrings, they look exactly like the pictures. They are really shiny and comfortable to wear. Excellent quality, I've been wearing them non stop and they are just perfect!!!! My favorite shop by far! I am so pleased and will be buying more stuff soon!!!! Thank you Ohana"
Omg these are perfect! I‚Äôm obsessed! I have been on the hunt for ear jacket earrings that actually hug my ear lobes and these are adjustable and fit perfect. So beautiful.
"Absolutely LOVE my single earrings, they‚Äôre amazing! and the box they come in is adorable! Favourite shop on Etsy! 5*****"
Heel mooi!!
"Rebeka had made me this custom order, it is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and is very high quality. This picture truly does not capture how gorgeous these earrings are. I had a particular color in mind and messaged Rebeka photos of what I wanted and asked if it was possible. She was very quick in replying to my messages and sent me photos of the exact stones she would use and drew me a design. It was very reasonably priced and arrived quickly in great packaging. She truly made my vision come true! 10/10 would recommend !!"
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
This is my 2nd order here and I own 7 earrings at this point. I love this shop. I am not sure how she ships so quickly. I was able to order anything I wanted in a black setting. Always looking forward to her new designs.
"These earrings arrived quickly, were packaged well, and are beautiful. The craftsmanship is excellent and they look/feel heavy without feeling heavy on my ears. I love the little ‚Äúclip‚Äù at the top to ensure they stay in place. They are exactly what I was looking for and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them...they will be showstoppers. Can‚Äôt wait to order more from Rebeka Jewelry."
Loveeee them!!!
"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!"
I was shocked by how sparkly these earrings are. The pictures don‚Äôt do them justice. So beautiful and perfect for my wedding. They are comfortable and light weight (which was important to me because I don‚Äôt wear earrings very often). The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.
"Truly beautiful earrings. I saw the photos on this post and wondered if the earrings would look the same on...and I can confirm, they do! They are also excellent quality and clarity. There are 3 different height settings to adjust the ear jacket to your ear size. I wore these for my wedding and highly recommend!"

"Un cabochon √©tait cass√© suite √† la livraison mais l√† boutique a √©t√© reactive et m'a rembours√©. Je recommande ces supports de cabochon, ils sont vraiment jolis et f√©minin. J'ai h√¢te de les utiliser pour mes prochaines cr√©ations. Merci beaucoup"
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
"I originally ordered the rose gold pierced earrings and they were out of stock. They contacted me and offered me a different finish. When I got them today I mail they sent me the rose gold climbers, which I didn‚Äôt order along with the other finish of the ones I originally ordered. Pleasant surprise and what great customer service! Thank you"
BEAUTIFUL. Couldn't be happier! so quick and dainty
So cute and the shipping + delivery was so fast!! Definitely buying from here again.
Gorgeous product! Well-made & well-packaged. The seller was extremely professional & a pleasure to work with!
"I love my dopamine earrings - I am a psychologist, so they are a great accessory for work. I had some difficulty receiving my order due to post office mix-ups. The seller was absolutely fantastic in dealing with these issues, even going so far as contacting the postal services in our respective countries and attempting to trace the package for me. In the end, he sent me a new order, no questions asked. I was extremely impressed with the service and would highly recommend this seller."
Very professional! The seller privately messaged me about my earrings and shipped them very fast. I had text messages too with updates from the postal service. The earrings themselves are beautiful. Excited to wear them...the case they came in was really nice and professional looking. Their jewelry would make great gifts! Thanks and happy holidaze‚úåÔ∏èüòé
"Just wow. This is my second purchase from OtisJaxon and the quality and pieces are just gorgeous. I have finally found classic earrings that aren't boring. As my partner put it: they are my ideal style: simple, classic, and complex in one design."
"The quality and versatile style is worth waiting for! My husband noticed them right away and complimented on there elegance. At first I worried about if they would be heavy and if they would pull on my ear, but they are the perfect weight. I love them!"
"I Love, Love, Love my Ear Jackets. They are beautiful and look just like the picture. The quality is fabulous and the presentation was awesome too!"
These are my favorite of all the earrings I ordered!! Very beautiful. Love the nice clean lines!
These earrings are truly beautiful. They are of high quality and so versatile to wear.
BEAUTIFUL! GIFT WRAPPED and PERFECT!
"This ear cuff earring is gorgeous! When I first bought it, the cuff part wouldn't stay in place and kept hanging down. I wrote to the seller, and she figured out a solution, by making the back of the cuff adjustable similar to some pierceless earrings. She sent me the new one free of charge, and it's perfect!"
beautiful earings and very fast shipping .
Love this earring! It was the perfect staple jewelry that I wore to a wedding! Received so many compliments and it stayed in during a night full of dancing
When I saw these earrings I thought they looked sexy. So I bought them! If you want to make yourself look sexy try these earrings!
Kristina's work is exquisite! I combined these with another pair I bought and they look so avant garde together! Love!
Purchased this set of beautiful and unique earrings for my wife for her birthday. Kristina was awesome to deal with - she was in contact as soon as the order was placed and kept me up to date with everything. She even took the time to gift wrap them for me! I would highly recommend Kristina if you are looking for that something a little bit different but with a touch of class.
"Sooooo beautiful, looks amazing. Thank you"
Such a gorgeous pair of earrings! LOVE the nature inspired design with seeds. So delightful and unique. Will be back for more from this shop! üòä
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
superbes boucles d'oreilles correspondent aux photos
"Malgr√© une petite p√©rip√©tie de transport (une boule d'oreille √©tait cass√©e), le service √©tait tout √† fait au rendez-vous avec l'envoi d'une boucle de remplacement dans la foul√©e. Elles sont tr√®s jolie et semblent de belle facture. Merci"
Merci Jo√´lle ! Je suis tr√®s contente de mon achat . Merci √©galement pour cette attention. üòç √† bient√¥t pour une prochaine commande pour moi ou pour offrir car j aime beaucoup le style de vos bijoux.
"Toujours aussi ravie, c'est un vendeur et cr√©ateur formidable, connu sur une autre plateforme, et je continue √† le suivre ici. Mes petits cadeaux font de grands plaisirs !"
Elegantes et simples. Article envoy√© rapidement. Avec un petit cadeau en plus et un mot tr√®s sympa de la part de Joelle.
I have not received this item and my grandaughter will be back home in a few days time- very disappointing. Joike
"Hi Joike, I don't understand because your order was deposited in your mailbox on July 16th. If you haven‚Äôt found it you should check with your postman or the post office. I'm so sorry for desagrement ; please tell me ... Regards Jo√´lle"
Love the way these look. Thanks!
Absolutely gorgeous! Arrived very quickly. Thanks.
"I really like these ear climbers. They look really neat. It took me a little while to get them on correctly the first time, but once I got it just right, they look great. The seller shipped them out really fast and I'm really happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
I absolutely loved the earrings! I have been wearing them ever since I got them. Very good quality. I absolutely would buy from this shop again.
"Tr√®s joli pendentif qui ravira ma petite artiste pour ses 10 ans ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• L'envoi fut rapide, l'emballage parfait et la pr√©sentation du bijou vraiment tr√®s joli. Je garde l'oeil car les autres articles de la collection palette pourraient l'int√©resser aussi ! Et je sais que la collection chat plairait beaucoup √† ses s≈ìurs ! Merci beaucoup et bonne continuation, c'est un plaisir de parcourir votre boutique r√©guli√®rement !"
I was so excited when I found them! They are so unique! I work for an Ophthalmologist & Optometrist and our patients were complimenting me all day. I just love them. Great size and quality!
Magnifiques et originales. Je les adore et ai re√ßu beaucoup de compliments. R√©ception du petit colis le temps d'un battement de cils ! Merci :D
Enti√®rement satisfaite de ma commande ! Petites boucles d‚Äôoreilles magnifiques destin√©es √† ma petite fille fan de Harry Potter ! Elle adoooorrre les boucles.... L‚Äôenvoi ultra rapide dans un emballage tout en douceur ! Merci de tout c≈ìur et bonne continuation.
Took exactly 6 weeks to receive these earrings but finally they arrived safely and I am loving them! Very comfortable- the posts are not too long so they do not poke behind the ear. They fit my lobe better in my second piercing- rather than the first- but that works just as well. I love anything new and different and these are certainly that! Thank you!
"Love the weight and feel of these, as well as how secure the notched posts feel. The gold is very warm and shiny, making the snakiness very subtle, which I love. Now I want them in silver too!"
"My second pair of earrings from this shop, and I doubt it will be my last! I ALWAYS get compliments whenever I wear either pair. The craftsmanship is amazing, as is the shop owners communication. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you!!"
"I love it, such beautiful craftmanship, the sodalitestone is of really high quality and love the little moon and stars on the back of the ring!!! The only problem is that I just want more and more of her jewelry- highly addictive!"
Beautiful and elegant. Customer service is lovely and helpful!
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
I highly recommend this earring! the shipment was very fast and maytal is super nice and very responsive. looks just like the photo :)
"I contacted the seller on this because after I purchased, I noticed they weren't on the site anymore. I panicked because they are AMAZING - and I definitely plan on purchasing again as gifts. They are so special. Really tiny and delicate - and just so pretty. LOVE LOVE LOVE."
"Love, Love, Love them. I love color and jewelry, so to get two things I love in one piece of jewelry, is a win, win in my book. Very satisfied, Thanks Jess jewelry dreams."
Beautiful earrings! They are super sparkly and I've gotten many compliments on them! Plenty of room to loop through my ear and twist up. I did need to squeeze a little as instructed for my little lobes.
Absolutely gorgeous earrings.. amazing quality. Lovely colours so so beautiful! Can‚Äôt fault at all. Would deffo buy again
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
"Tr√®s belle qualit√©, j'ai choisi celle plaqu√©e or, je n'ai aucune r√©action et elle est tr√®s confortable m√™me pour dormir avec."
Little longer than I was expecting but all in all I love them.
Love this piece! Beautifully crafted. Quick delivery.
Exactly what I wanted. Thank youüòä
Given the shape of my ear (?) I ended up bending the drips down so it wouldn‚Äôt look like a phone earpiece lol. But it looks great! I‚Äôm very pleased!
"Beautiful!! Shiny and gorgeous, I have sensitive ears and I can‚Äôt feel them when they‚Äôre in. They stay in place, unless I accidentally bump them. New favorite earrings for sure."
"Gorgeous dripping ear climbers! I‚Äôve had ear climbers since a San Francisco company made them in the 90s, and I love these. These are made with the same quality, care, and craftsmanship as my originals. Thank you so much!"
Love this crawler. I combined it with the cuff. Sooo beautiful. Collecting compliments since wearing it. Oh- and it s really light! You barely feel you are wearing it :)
"Je suis ravie, tout est parfait"
I love this pendant. It is so unusual and I very much enjoy it's distinct form and colors.
"Superbe collier, je l'ai re√ßu dans les temps. Trop contente de mon achat üòâüòä"
Magnifique comme sur la photo je vous la recommande ! Je les adore ! Merci beaucoup !
"Hi! Thank you, this ear cuff is just adorable, and so original! I love it. The shipment took some days more than expected, but it was so worth it! <3"
"Pretty ring, comfortably light weight, and it's true to size. My thumb ring size is a 7 and I ordered a size 7. Thank you!"
"I waited several weeks for this, but it was worth it. Solid, detailed cuff with comfort in mind."
Finally received my order.. the mail was horribly slow... the ring is solid and beautiful exactly what I wanted... Rin was responsive to my inquiries which I appreciate... slow shipping was not his fault!!!!
Bought it as a unique gift for a 50th birthday present. Arrived much quicker than advised and before the birthday. Recipient of gift really liked them.
Vielen Dank f√ºr die passenden Ohrringe zur Kette. Sie sind wie die Kette wundersch√∂n geworden. Ich freue mich schon beides zu meiner Hochzeit zu tragen. Thank you Shirli. The earrings are stunning like the necklace. I'm happy and looking forward wearing both things on my wedding day.
Shipped much faster than I expected. Had some adjustment in my cartilage piercing for a couple of days (the piercing size is a bit larger than a normal earring I think) but I love this - wear it every day now!
Delivery was flawless. The piece is beautifully crafted and looks lovely. However for me it is too uncomfortable to wear often. The back isn‚Äôt flat and uses a thick butterfly clasp to secure it which isn‚Äôt what I normally wear. The post is long and sticks out way too far from behind my ear. I have some tools and was able to shorten the post to make it more make it more comfortable. That isn't better for me as because the post is very thick and it is hard to get it into my piercing. So I will try to file the post thickness down next. The piece was a pricey investment and would like to figure out a way to wear it. These details are my personal preference however and would encourage you to purchase the piece and wear it yourself. I am highly sensitive and find I notice how things feel more rather than how they look.
"Absolutely love my new pieces! I bought both the climbers and the cuff pictured because I liked the look so much, and they work just as wonderfully together on my ears. Beautiful jewelry!"
This picture does not do it justice. I got the earrings and two ear cuffs. My oh my they are beautiful! I‚Äôm so excited to wear these!!
Absolutely gorgeous! I‚Äôm in love with my new set! Fast shipping too! I would definitely buy from here again!
"This came out wayyy better than I expected! I used these ear climbers for my wedding and they were super cute. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because I lost 1 ear climber at the end of the day. :( I know I had put it on correctly and tightened it, but it didn‚Äôt hold up. Otherwise, the earrings are still great!"
"Habe nur Gutes zu berichten √ºber meinen Kauf. Abi hat sofort auf Fragen geantwortet, z√ºgig geliefert und alles verlief organisiert und plangem√§√ü. W√ºrde hier jederzeit wieder kaufen. Nur Individualisierungsw√ºnsche an diesem Artikel waren nicht m√∂glich. Ich m√∂chte aber die Arbeit und den Shop von Abi sehr gern weiterempfehlen."
"Absolutely love my ring, love the finish and sturdiness of the ring, will 100% be buying from this seller again! Also great customer service and communication from the seller. Thanks Abi!"
"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. While shipping took a little while and was hard to track, it was absolutely worth the (short) wait. I‚Äôm so excited to wear this band for the rest of my days. ‚ô•Ô∏è 10/10 would recommend."
I love my new earrings! Quality craftsmanship!
Ces petites boucles sont aussi mignonnes que je l'esp√©rais! Isabelle a √©t√© tr√®s rapide car je les ai re√ßues en moins de 3jours! Avec un petit mot et mes initiales grav√©es comme je l'avais pr√©cis√©. Je recommande vivement cette boutique et je ferai s√ªrement d'autres commandes.
"This is exactly what I wanted. It's beautiful and delicate. I wear a rose gold version on my pinky, and a silver version on my ring finger. And the combination looks great. Thanks, Isabelle. ps. for the look and quality of this ring, I have to say a special thank you for making the price really affordable. I saw one exactly the same in a shop in Paris - the asking price was EUR85 (!)"
"Article tr√®s joli ! De tr√®s bonne qualit√©, n‚Äôh√©sitez surtout pas ! Et la vendeuse est AU TOP ! Tr√®s gentille et tr√®s r√©active, je vous recommande vivement sa boutique ü•∞"
I love it! Beautiful quality and I receive many compliments on it.
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
"Bonjour, Je viens de recevoir les boucles d'oreilles! Je suis ravie et h√¢te de les porter...Ma soeur va s√ªrement me les piquer aussi üòä‚ù§"
"Tout simplement sublime! Magnifique! ‚ù§ Trop beau, je suis trop contente de mon achat. Parfait pour les 2 photos souvenir que je voulais cadrer. Beau travail de la cr√©atrice. Emballage soign√©. Merci beaucoup."
This was a gift for my mum and she is delighted with it. She says the colours are rich and very pretty and it matches her dining room decor! She also loved the personalised message.
"There was a minor shipping issue (no fault of the shipper, just the post office) but after that was resolved, we got the bowl and it is beautiful! The perfect gift for my husband and our 7th wedding anniversary! Thank you so much!!"
"On adore:) c‚Äôest super joli! Taille id√©ale pour notre fils qui portera les alliances ! Travail soign√©, qualitatif et envoi rapide:) Merci!!"
Really pretty piece. I've recently become slightly obsessed with ear cuffs and this one is great!
I love it! Thank you!
This item is beautiful!! Great work and a fun new accessory!
"Very nice, good communication, pretty."
They are beautiful and IÔ∏è get a lot of compliments
Good style and the description of product it's the same
"I love this piece! It‚Äôs so cute! I will say that if you like leaving your jewelry in for long periods of time, you will need to like just go over the jewelry with like a cotton swab and something to clean it with. Gets kinda dirty fast for some reason! Will buy from this seller again. Lol I‚Äôm like super faded in the pic but it shows the jewelry so whatever lol"
"I love the nose ring so much I ordered 4! Lol, for my double nostril and double helix."
These bracelets are so adorable! I get so many compliments on it! I cannot wait to see my friend‚Äôs response when she gets hers ‚ù§Ô∏è
"This is just amazing, my girl she loved it soo much !! And she is wearing it almost everyday."
Love it! Super cute on!!!
"Really sweet eye, and very friendly and efficient vendors. Thumbs up here üòÄüëç"
"Very nice earrings, well-packed and shipped in a timely fashion. I highly recommend this seller!"
"Literally have gotten five climber earrings from this shop in the past few weeks. I‚Äôm in complete love. Amazing quality and work, fast shipping too. Thank you so much!!!"
Received these and I'm so happy! They are just as beautiful as the pictures made them seem! So we'll made and I am so excited to wear them! Love them!
"These earrings are exactly what I was looking for! So dainty, but something a bit different. I can't wait to wear them on my wedding day! I would definitely recommend these. Really well made and fabulous customer service."
These are a perfect size for a crawler earring that doesn't overpower your look. Simple sophistication. Beautiful with just the right amount of sparkle.
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
This is so pretty! The earring fits perfectly in my tragus and the flat back is easy to put it and remove. I requested a custom length and Rosec Jewels was able to accommodate. Very happy with the purchase!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
"Hello, we tried to contact you several times, but there is no response. We would like to satisfy our customer however we don't accept any unprovoked bad reviews. Thanks"
"Got it for a friend for her birthday, she loved it! Will definitely be purchasing from this store in the future."
"Tr√®s beau cadeau, fut bien appr√©ci√©"
"This was a Birthday gift for a very dear frind, she absolutely loves it!"
"Love my earrings! They go perfect with the Celtic helix piercing I got from this seller & a similar Celtic ring. They look great together! They were waiting for me when I got home from Europe. Third purchase from this seller, she is awesome, great quality, packaged well & I have been 100% happy with all 3 of my purchases. A+++"
"They're bigger on my ear than I anticipated from the photo, but I still enjoy them."
"My girlfriend proudly wears them every day! Thank you very much, Shirli! Amazing piece of jewelry. Same as bracelet, you made for me earlier! Your jewelry brings fairy tales inside. ^"
"I bought these as well as a cartilage earring to match. Stunning, well made, and absolutely love them!"
I purchased these ear climbers for my daughter as a gift. She loved them. They are beautiful and unique. I hesitated about ordering internationally but decided to take the chance considering they were my favorite when compared to many others listed. Maytal was in close contact with me throughout the shipping process with delays as expected due to the pandemic. Her customer service and concern were superb...she updated me frequently until they arrived at my post office. I would not hesitate in ordering from her in the future.
"Beautiful work! Love them! And shipping was fast from Israel! Even faster than USPS these days. Toda Raba, Maital!!"
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
I highly recommend this earring! the shipment was very fast and maytal is super nice and very responsive. looks just like the photo :)
"Article de tr√®s bonne qualit√©, d√©lai de livraison tr√®s court, plusieurs d√©licats petits cadeaux faits avec beaucoup d'amour. J'aime beaucoup ce site internet et la dame. Bonne journ√©e √† vous tous."
"B.O. plus petites que pr√©vu mais en revanche, Cristelle est tr√®s √† l'√©coute : elle m'a mont√© les B.O. sur les crochets en argent que j'avais inclus √† ma commande. Merci !"
I am very pleased with my purchase. The items are of great quality and so creative. The cristals are beautiful. I love the bracelets and the earrings. I really recommend !
"Tr√®s jolie citrine. Envoi soign√© avec petite grenouille en origami en cadeau, carte fleur de vie pour recharger les cristaux et bon de retour en cas de probl√®me. Cristelle pense √† tout. Les pierres sont plus grosses que ce que je croyais et pas trop irr√©guli√®res pour des chips. Rapport qualit√©-prix excellent, je recommande. Juste une petite suggestion : faire les colliers un peu plus courts et les bracelets un peu moins justes ! Je rach√®terai des bijoux dans cette boutique (merci Cristelle de m'avertir quand vous aurez de l'oeil de tigre et de la cornaline !)"
tr√®s originales ces boucles d'oreilles tout en √©tant jolies
"Originales et √©cologiques, j‚Äôadore! Et l‚Äôenvoie a √©t√© rapide!"
"Originales et √©cologiques, j‚Äôadore! Et l‚Äôenvoie a √©t√© rapide!"
Earrings arrived quickly! They're just as shown and I love the industrial vibe from them.
"Are they '20s? Are they '80s? Are they totally au courant? Hold onto your lobes: They're all three. These 3D-printed beauties are timeless, they're eye-catching, they're comfortable, and their design is just perfect. I can't get enough of them. I'll post a picture when I can get my kids to help, I can't do them justice in the mirror."
"The owner left me a really nice note, and the earrings shipped so, so fast! Really happy with it :)"
One of the coolest pair of earrings that I own!
"That's right, I bought two pairs. And just like I said in the other review, these evoke trends of the past while also being dramatically of-the-moment in design and manufacture. I can't wait to see what this designer comes up with next, I adore their aesthetic."
Today is 7 of february. I dont know where are my pack et. ..... 38 days at√©
"Omg , I‚Äôm so in love with this bracelet.My wrist is so small and she makes its so perfect.And even the box she sent to me it‚Äôs beautiful too ‚ù§Ô∏èThanks so much and I‚Äôm going to buy some more jewelry from her ."
"I got the Rose Gold band, with September, April, and May. The ring is absolutely beautiful, I'm so in love with how it looks. I don't wear rings because I don't like the way they feel between my fingers, but I can't even tell I have it on, and stones are flat so nothing really is sticking up to much! I recommend this ring to any mom, you will not regret."
I wanted the necklace to be longer (since I don‚Äôt like when things feel tight around my neck). The shop messaged me and we were able to make it that way! So happy with it! My new favorite necklace!
tr√®s joli tout est parfait
"De tr√®s belles boucles l√©g√®res et agr√©ables √† porter! Un excellent contact avec la cr√©atrice....d une grande √©coute et gentillesse! Merci, je reviendrai sans probl√®me üòä"
Les perles sont parfaites et envoy√©es rapidement. C'est la deuxi√®me fois que je commande est c'est toujours le top !
Pendientes preciosos y comodos. Entrega rapidisima. Muy contenta con la compra
"The earings look lovely, made beautifully and just what I was looking for"
"The earrings are stunning, SO beautiful! Great quality. Arrived quick and perfectly packaged. Thanks!"
Todav√≠a no lo he recibido
"Hola Elisa! Nacex no consigue encontrarte. Mandanos por favor tu numero de mobil para que puedan contactarte. saludos, Jess"
"Love love love them. My new go to earrings. Both pairs ordered came quickly in a lovely simply wrapped package. Great care given, and worth every penny."
"Really unusual, always attract the 'ooh, what interesting earrings!' compliment."
"Took a while to get here, but totally worth it!"
My new fav earrings. Love these earrings. Simple and timeless
"Needed a custom design. There was a little bit of a communication issue initially but we worked it out. Do glad that I trusted my instincts. I love my piece; it is simply stunning! I am a huge pearl lover and the design was just what I was looking for. It is stylish, comfortable, and absolutely beautiful."
I love it! There was a small issue with my order but the seller was quick to respond and resolved it promptly. I got the triangle dots and it looks exactly as pictured. The perfect dainty piece for my third lobe piercing
"So beautiful, I got this for my conch! I got it in yellow gold with a white stone in the middle and it came perfectly customized and very nicely packaged!"
Stunning! Great gift idea
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn¬¥t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I¬¥ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I¬¥ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
"I love these earrings! They are gorgeous and unique and sooo sparkly! They fit perfectly, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day! These earrings have the clamp on the back for the upper part of the earlobe so if your ears are small or not shaped right these might not fit great. Fast shipping and they were exactly as described. Thank you Iloniti!"
Absolutely gorgeous. She is so helpful and sent me earrings with boxes and bags. These are even more beautiful in person since she uses really great quality stones
I LOVE these earrings. They are even better than I hoped they would be (and I had high hopes). Will definitely shop here again!
These are absolutely stunning. I feel so elegant! I have tiny ears so the birds cover pretty much the whole bottom half of my ear but I still think it looks great. They are difficult to get in unless you bend the backing to straighten out the angle quite a lot.
"I love these earrings! They are beautiful, and detailed. Everything about them is wonderful! From the packaging to how it fits. There is nothing I would change about it!"
"These are the sweetest earrings and are so comfortable to wear! I love them! I will definitely order from arajera again! The packaging was awesome, in a little bottle! Shop early for the holidays because it did take nearly a month to arrive from the Philippines! ‚ù§"
"Rebeka had made me this custom order, it is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and is very high quality. This picture truly does not capture how gorgeous these earrings are. I had a particular color in mind and messaged Rebeka photos of what I wanted and asked if it was possible. She was very quick in replying to my messages and sent me photos of the exact stones she would use and drew me a design. It was very reasonably priced and arrived quickly in great packaging. She truly made my vision come true! 10/10 would recommend !!"
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
This is my 2nd order here and I own 7 earrings at this point. I love this shop. I am not sure how she ships so quickly. I was able to order anything I wanted in a black setting. Always looking forward to her new designs.
"These earrings arrived quickly, were packaged well, and are beautiful. The craftsmanship is excellent and they look/feel heavy without feeling heavy on my ears. I love the little ‚Äúclip‚Äù at the top to ensure they stay in place. They are exactly what I was looking for and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them...they will be showstoppers. Can‚Äôt wait to order more from Rebeka Jewelry."
"perfect fit, so cute and elegant, just love it"
I received my black diamond chain ring in the mail. I love it! it is sung enough that it will one come off in my gloves. Shipping was right on track considering it was over seas it came very fast. I will definitely make more perches from seller and company.
"This ring is so intricate and beautiful, I get so many compliments on it. I had bought this previously and lost it, so I had to but it again! Looks just a beautiful as the first one i bought, and also great quality, never tarnishes!"
I received this ring today...on my birthday! Yayyy! It is the sweetest thing. I totally love it and it was well worth the wait! üíû
"Needed a custom design. There was a little bit of a communication issue initially but we worked it out. Do glad that I trusted my instincts. I love my piece; it is simply stunning! I am a huge pearl lover and the design was just what I was looking for. It is stylish, comfortable, and absolutely beautiful."
I love it! There was a small issue with my order but the seller was quick to respond and resolved it promptly. I got the triangle dots and it looks exactly as pictured. The perfect dainty piece for my third lobe piercing
"So beautiful, I got this for my conch! I got it in yellow gold with a white stone in the middle and it came perfectly customized and very nicely packaged!"
"Gorgeous earrings, got that luxurious yet humble look. Extremely fast and high quality shipping!"
I love these earrings! I bought the mandala necklace a few months ago and these are a perfect match. It arrived quickly. Couldn't be happier!!
"The earrings are beautiful a bit smaller and thinner than I expected, but I loved them anyway!"
Love them!!
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
"It's definitely very pretty indeed. The issue is the size. Perhaps I have small ears, but the two I ordered this time round are very big indeed. This cuff pretty much sits down on my lobe. The other I bought is unwearable, it's so big. The posts are too long, too. I realise they have thousands and thousands of positive reviews - they're definitely the only shop making such beautiful cuffs! And definitely I could just have tiny ears. I've bought several cuffs in the past from this shop and while they were large, they didn't feel as comedically large as my newest order. Upshot: if you think you may have small ears, be ready for an awkward fit, and for the possibility of having to squeeze them smaller."
My first pair of ear jacket design. I love the little spiral posts.
Bought these ear jacket earrings with the lotus studs. They are even more beautiful than the pictures show. Love them!
"Very quick shipping; especially in corona-times. Nice packaging, even including a little ""extra"". Quality item, quite original and very comfortable to wear. Has gotten lots of compliments on the earrings."
"these earrings are gorgeous! so simple and elegant, yet a subtle statement piece of jewelry. sarah is so patient and so sweet! this product exceeded my expectations and i absolutely love it !"
"The earrings are beautiful, but my one dissapointment is that when I ordered the gold earrings, I assumed the posts would be too. I have sensitive ears, and have a pretty significant allergic reaction unless the posts are gold too. Pretty bummed üòî I just read the item description and see that it mentions the posts are SS. Wish I'd read that more closely! They really are so beautiful"
Had hoped to find cool post earrings since all of mine are hooks...not so great with all this mask wearing. These are beautiful & versatile - love them!
"This is a beautiful pair of earrings. They arrived in a timely manner, fit comfortably, & haven't irritated my sensitive ears. My biggest concern is how fragile they feel. Naturally, the jacket part has to be pretty thin so you can get the post & back through it, but the material itself felt soft and flexible. Maybe this is just my own ignorance about soft metals talking. The glue or welding job to connect the post to the circle stud wasn't the neatest, though no one else would see that when I'm wearing them. At the end of the day, this is a lovely pair of earrings, but for myself & my budget, I wouldn't repurchase them."
"Exactly as the photos show. I am thankful for the extra plastic plugs but I don't think I will need them as the crawler fits very well, not too snug. Thank you. :)"
This is a gorgeous piece! Feels good on and looks good too!
Just like pictured. Beautiful.
So cute and fun to wear! Fast shipment.
I love this ear climber. It's delicate and beautiful. I would definitely recommend!
i love my ear climber! great product
I get a lot of compliments. Beautiful item!
bijou tr√®s fin et √† la hauteur de mes esp√©rances!
This item took a while to ship but only because of the distance and I have NO complaints. The earrings are cute and came in cute little bottle packaging. Seller took the time to make sure they would reach me in perfect condition. Thank you! Would buy again!
These DO take the full month to arrive but well worth it they are adorable!! Love the packaging!!!
These earrings are really unique! I purchased them as a gift to a friend and I think she'll love them! One thing I particularly liked was that the seller included care instructions as well! And the packaging was super cute!
They arrived beautifully packaged in a small glass bottle with cork. They are very well made and I am delighted with them
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
"Magnifique ! √Ä la bonne taille, r√©sistant, brillant, je suis fan ! Un grand merci !ü•∞"
"It's meravilleause, thin and chic. I love it!"
I love because it's different!
"So cute! I would note that the material is quite thin and bends easily, so you have to handle it with a little extra care, but it's such a lovely and unique piece."
"Bought for a Christmas present, arrived really quickly. Good quality & look great"
"My new all time favorite earrings!! They are beautiful, lightweight, and I get tons of compliments when I wear them. They are perfect for everyday wear. I only wish they came in other metal options I would buy them all!! The packaging was gorgeous as well!!!"
Iris went above and beyond with my purchase. She always kept me up to date with the shipping information. I know it doesn‚Äôt seem like much but I ordered other earrings from other vendors on Etsy and Iris was the only one to reach out to me. The earrings came beautifully packaged and look amazing. Great quality.
"Achtung - nur f√ºr gr√∂√üere Ohrl√§ppchen geeignet! Sie sind f√ºr meine Ohrl√§ppchen leider viel zu lang. Man kann die Ohrringe zwar verstellen, aber selbst bei der kleinsten Einstellung sind sie noch zu lang und liegen nicht am Ohr an. Ich werde sie wohl weiterverkaufen oder verschenken. Die Qualit√§t ist trotzdem super gut!"
"Fast shipping, great customer service, and the earring are awesome! They are dainty, but because they are ear jackets they still make a statement - perfect for elevating everyday wear, love them!!"
"Very nice earrings, well-packed and shipped in a timely fashion. I highly recommend this seller!"
Earrings came SUPER FAST & are SUPER CUTE. I get compliments at least once/day. Will definitely be buying more soon!
"Gorgeous! This is my first set of ear climbers, and I love mixing and matching them with other earrings for asymmetrical looks. <3"
"These are so cute! They are as pictured and arrived quickly. They are pretty sturdy as well - when I was undressing one fell off in the bathroom and I couldn't find it and, of course, the next morning I stepped on it with my shoe and bent it. :( I was able to carefully straighten it out without breaking it. I don't recommend doing it, and it could have easily snapped on a delicate area but I'm so glad it didn't."
I bought these and the leaf ones - love them both. They¬¥re super pretty and no problem to slip on. They stay in place nicely.
These are so pretty on - very delicate and totally unique. Shipping is fast and packaging is beautiful. I lost one down a sink and immediately ordered another pair as these have become my go to earrings for date night. Absolutely beautiful!
"I absolutely love these earrings, I bought them for prom and they look amazing."
Love them. I wanted ear jacket chain earrings for a while. These are perfect. Look trendy and stylish
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"
Earrings came SUPER FAST & are SUPER CUTE. I get compliments at least once/day. My only problem is trying to decide which of the three pairs that I bought to wear. Will definitely be buying more soon!
I got the black one and they are the cutest!
I love these earrings!!! FAST SHIPPING and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! You guys are the best :)
These are exactly as pictured and got here FAST. I will absolutely buy from this shop again!
"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
I absolutely love these earrings. The stone stud is the perfect size and I love the detail on the circles. I want them in onyx too!
"An appreciative and big ""WOW"" is the first reaction I had when I received my first pair (but definitely not my last!) of Kathy's gorgeus creations. They are wonderful, light weight, beautiful and well -- just fun! Plus, as her shop descriptions explain so well, they can be worn in so many different ways so you are really getting far more than just one pair of earrings. While the product is what you are purchasing, Kathy's caring, prompt and wonderful service is among the best of the best. Ditto the eye-catching packaging too. Thank you, Kathy, for being there and for sharing your amazing talents with all fortunate enough to cross paths with you and your great Etsy shop!"
Very professional! The seller privately messaged me about my earrings and shipped them very fast. I had text messages too with updates from the postal service. The earrings themselves are beautiful. Excited to wear them...the case they came in was really nice and professional looking. Their jewelry would make great gifts! Thanks and happy holidaze‚úåÔ∏èüòé
"LOVE these earrings! They are exactly as described and I couldn't be happier with them. My ears are pretty sensitive to the types of materials I can wear, and so far, my ears haven't reacted to the material. Very happy with these earrings!"
My new ear climbers are beautiful!
"Thank you so much! Love the earrings, they are just perfect and fit nicely :) No problem with shipping and great communication with Largentolab. Recommend!"
So neat!! Love them!
Very nice quality.
"This ear cuff earring is gorgeous! When I first bought it, the cuff part wouldn't stay in place and kept hanging down. I wrote to the seller, and she figured out a solution, by making the back of the cuff adjustable similar to some pierceless earrings. She sent me the new one free of charge, and it's perfect!"
These ear climbers are beauties! Rose gold is my new color and I am lovin these!
Merci et √† bient√¥t. Cordialement Fran√ßoise
"J'adore. Boucles tr√®s jolies. L√©g√®res, originales. Elles correspondent √† photo et √† la description. Colis rapide et soign√©. Merci"
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles ! Merci beaucoup, je suis ravie üòÅ"
"Comme sur la photo de pr√©sentation, les BO sont tr√®s belles et feront le bonheur de mon ado √† No√´l. Merci √† vous pour ce beau travail."
"Absolutely love them! Picture doesnt give it justice, they are gorgeous!!!"
So pretty and perfect! Easy to put on and fit extremely well. They stay right where they're supposed to.
"Trop jolie, je kiffe J'ai re√ßu la paire dans une jolie bo√Æte .je recommande üëçüèº"
wore it once and its perfect. The only thing is that my ears are thin so it doesn't to stay up. They look great down as well. I would tighten it but the instructions says not to.
Magnifiques cr√©oles assorties √† leur noeud pour cheveux ! Je suis fan. Envoi et qualit√© irr√©prochable.
"Conforme √† la photo ! Cependant, l'emballage dans un sachet transparent n'est pas l'id√©al. Il ne met pas en avant le produit. Je suis persuad√©e que ce cadeau va plaire !"
"I'm loving these climbers....these are my first of this style so there was a learning curve to figure out how to get them in easily, but now it's a piece of cake. Love the minimalist design & hammered texture. They're perfect!"
"Pros: Minimalistic. Super pretty. Everybody compliments them. I can sleep and shower and do everything with them. My hair hasn't gotten stuck in them yet. All-around superb purchase. Cons: really hard for me to put in my ears. Mostly because I think one of my holes is a little crooked. I won't be taking them out anytime soon, and it's already been a few weeks, so it doesn't matter too much."
"Absolutely love these earrings! They were a little tricky to get on the first time, since I haven't had a style like this before. But they fit nicely, and were exactly what I wanted - something minimal but a little trendy. I'm not one for big earrings and these are perfect!"
I seriously love them. I pretty much haven't taken them out since I got them and find sleeping in them to be comfortable. I did have to pull them apart a tiny bit just because they were hurting my ears but now they fit awesome. But I love them!!!!
These are beautiful! Thanks for the fast service! I'm looking forward to wearing them with all my earring studs.
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
"WOW! I love it! This is the first ear climber I've ever had and I was worried about the fit- This came in and I popped it on so easily. It feels very secure without pinching me and I can't even tell I'm wearing it. I also got the dark pearls with gold drips and am equally impressed with those. The seller was very forthcoming about how the shipping ended up being delayed due to world events, and I never felt worried about it."
"This earring is so cool! I love it. The quality and craftspersonship is wonderful. They packaged it with great care for shipping. Included a cleaning cloth and how to care card. The jewelry box it came in is lovely, unique looking and perfect size for storage to keep it safe from being bent. I will definitely order from Mariejune again."
"The design is really beautiful. I'm so happy with this purchase. Seller was sweet and communicative. When it was going to take a little longer to complete, she messaged me with a new ship date. In total, it took about a month from purchase to receipt. I'm ok with this since lead times and shipping times were warned ahead of purchase due to the pandemic."
"Love the look, love the quality, look the packaging Edit update: so many compliments on this jewelry üò≥üò≥üò≥‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I purchased this as a gift for my mother's birthday. She loves amber and has admired the ear jackets I've worn. This was a happy marriage of both. When she received these earrings, she absolutely LOVED them. She said they are very elegant and received many compliments on these beautiful pair of earrings. Thank you very much for making my Mom happy. ;-)"
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles. Je suis ravie. Merci
They are perfect. I love the option of studs or dangling. Thank you!
Very nice. Will wear often. A bit smaller than expected.. Shipping was prompt.
beau bijou livr√© cejour..Merci attendons le24!!!
C'est une pierre synth√©tique !!
"La majorit√© des pierres vendues sur ma boutique sont naturelles, certaines sont effectivement synth√©tiques, c'est alors pr√©cis√© dans la description."
"tres bonne tres beaux bijoux , super service"
I ordered three of these in different styles. It comes as a single. I had some confusion when I was trying to make my selection and the shop owner helped me and updated the listing. I was so happy to find these. They shipped and arrived quickly. Thank you!!!

"I got 2 (B and D). Compare to B, I like this one. The top is not loose, not easy to fall off."
I just got this in the mail today and I really like it! It‚Äôs so unique and pretty and took less than a week to arrive ü•∞
"Absolutely beautiful! Light, eye catching and perfect! Absolutely love them!"
"I highly recommend this seller - the earrings are beautiful and my sister loves them! Ildiko was kind and easy to work with, and the earrings were shipped and arrived quickly. I would definitely buy from this shop again. Thank you!"
"Beautifully made and great quality, shipped fast."
"Ildiko is my kindred spirit of jewelry makers. The first time I saw her work was at the market in Port Moody, British Columbia about 10 years ago. It was instant jewelry-love: classics with just a hint of sass. I‚Äôve slowly been building my collection of Ildiko silver ever since by putting them on my birthday/Christmas wish lists. Each piece is a gorgeous workhorse that draws comments from coworkers/strangers and is durable enough to withstand daily wear. I was looking for gold hoops and was thrilled when Ildiko expanded out to gold. These hoops are as beautiful IRL as in the photos. With a little twist of the hook you can adjust which way they hang. (I like mine to hang parallel to my face.) Her online customer service is as friendly and efficient as her in-person market service. I can‚Äôt recommend Ildiko‚Äôs jewelry enough!"
Beautiful and elegant. Customer service is lovely and helpful!
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
I highly recommend this earring! the shipment was very fast and maytal is super nice and very responsive. looks just like the photo :)
Use this for a cartilage piercing and I love it. Have gotten a lot of compliments. Shipped fast! Thank you!
So pretty and look so cute!! Love these so much!
Love this! Really stands out and is comfortable on my ears.
Such pretty earrings. Everything went just fine. Thank you!
Je les adore! Elles sont tr√®s belles!

Look great! They‚Äôre going to be a present for my sister and I just know she‚Äôll love them! They arrived really quickly and came is a cute pouch.
SO BEAUTIFUL üòç I am in LOVE with this look! All the way from Spain to Florida in a cute package with a personalized noteüí´üí´üí´
Total class. Simply adore these. Best earrings I have ever bought.
"Superbe collier, je l'ai re√ßu dans les temps. Trop contente de mon achat üòâüòä"
I love this pendant. It is so unusual and I very much enjoy it's distinct form and colors.
"Je suis ravie, tout est parfait"
"C'est tr√®s joli, livr√© rapidement et avec soin, merci"
"Fast shipping, beautifully packaged item. They fit like a dream and add just the perfect edge to an outfit. I love them and will definitely purchase more items from the shop in the future. Thank you!"
"Le colis est livr√©, envoi soign√© les boucles d'oreilles est juste superbe Merci je recommande cette boutique. üòç"
I love this earrings! Got them in time and beautifully packed.
Muy contenta! Llegaron perfectos y a tiempo. Muchas gracias! :)
Je les adore ! Elles correspondent exactement aux photos cependant le fermoir en plastique est trop dur √† mettre sinon parfaites
Beautiful earrings!
"Perfect, exactly what I was looking for! Took a couple of weeks to the UK fyi, but wait is worth it."
"The ring is so delicate and the raw crystal is beautiful. I did not measure my finger size correctly, so the ring is a little too big BUT I wear it with another band that is the right size and it holds the ring on just beautifully. I wear it every day. Seller also included a bonus gift of an obsidian point key ring, which was above and beyond as freebies go, but I love it. (Since I'm not going anywhere these days, I took the crystal off the key ring and wear it as a necklace!)"
"it‚Äôs so cute and super easy to put in. this is literally the only nose ring that i‚Äôve worn longer than 2 days. super comfortable, i‚Äôd recommend"
Love it! It‚Äôs a great design. I see myself coming back to this shop many more times in the near future! I love the creativity and I‚Äôm more than pleased to have found this shop even more exciting is the fact that it‚Äôs a Canadian shop and pretty close to my city. I love supporting small town Canadian Businesses and will spend more money at local shops than at international ones..Thank you so much And I have to say you will definitely have my business again! The seller went above and beyond with my order including so many amazing extras!! Including extra industrial barbells.. I love your designs! Last thing I had to make sure a mention is the very fast shipping! Once thanks so much!!
"I'm over the moon about these gorgeous studs, which are exactly as pictured: A simple yet interesting design that uses flattened silver with the wide part on the edge, overlapping ends, and finished with an antiquing wash. I love them. Due to COVID-19 shipping shutdowns, it took two months (to the day!) to receive them from Israel. But they are here safe and sound and in glad hands (or rather, on glad ears). Thank you, Vladis!"
This is a beautiful ring. I love it!
"Arrived quite quickly, lovely earrings, thank you."
"Superbes perles avec strass , livraison super rapide , apr√©s 1 semaine , ce matin elles sont toutes oxyd√©s jaune fonc√© donc poubelle , le vendeur est super r√©glo est vient de me rembours√© les perles oxyd√©s , excellent vendeur , je vous recommande la boutique , merci beaucoup les bijoux de Francesca !!"

super mooie oorbellen!! blij mee
"Je poursuis mon commentaire qui tient compte de la paire de BO pr√©c√©dentes (BO coeur argent√©)... En tout point, et comme d'habitude avec La Boutique de Flaure, les cr√©ations sont fid√®les aux photos et m√™me plus jolies encore ! La livraison est tr√®s rapide, les informations concernant les d√©lais pr√©cises et SURTOUT : quel ravissement et quelle d√©licatesse dans les emballages (bien que sans avoir pr√©ciser qu'il s'agissait d'un cadeau). Je vous recommande encore et encore cette cr√©atrice. Je ne me lasse pas de son univers !"
"Wonderful!!! And charmingly gift wrapped as these are for my daughter's birthday. As I've not yet seen her to bestow gifts, I used all restraint to not open to peek, but that would spoil the presentation. And, I DID purchase two pairs in addition. One for myself, ( the Bronze 1930's...worn them 3 days in a row, love them!) The Bronze Folklore will be a future gift. These arrived in rapid time, before the Birthday (delayed by snowstorms) all the way from France to New York in less than 2 weeks, with a lovely personal note to me, best wishes to my daughter in an envelope I shall keep as the mailing stamps are art as well. I shall take another virtual vacation to a beautiful country sans doute (without a doubt?) Merci!"
"Bonjour, Je souhaitais revenir sur cette premi√®re commande pour vous faire part de ma satisfaction. En effet, command√© pendant la p√©riode des f√™tes de fin d'ann√©e, j'ai eu la tr√®s agr√©able surprise de recevoir ces BO dans les meilleurs d√©lais (moins de 3 jours !) avec toute le s√©rieux dont est capable ""Flaure"" : ponctualit√©, emballage +++, petit mot plein d'attentions et enfin le magnifique article : encore plus joli ""en vrai"" !!! MERCI et exp√©rience addictive garantie !"
These earrings are even better in person!!! They are adorable and unusual - I've worn them multiple times already and are one of my very favorites!
Great quality! Fits my ear perfectly.
"I just got this t-shirt and I love it! The graphic quality is great, and the shirt is super soft. The seller was quick to respond when I asked if she could make it in a custom color. She happily agreed; I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase!"
"Very cute shirt! Unisex fit, and I‚Äôm really liking oversized tees right now so I sized up and it was the perfect length to tie and pair with high-waisted jeans."
This shirt was super cute and comfy! It came so quickly too which was awesome!
"Beautiful and dainty, I absolutely love them!! And fast delivery, I will most definitely be purchasing from this shop again. Thank you!!"
"Excellent customer service. Very quick delivery. Beautiful earrings, well made, would highly recommend them."
"These are lovely earrings, unfortunately either the position of my piercing or the size of my lobes means that they don't fit my ears the way they do in the photo. It's a shame they aren't adjustable so I could shorten them a little."
"Best recommendations! Responsible seller, fast shipping, impeccable quality products. And as a bonus - very pleasant communication. Thank you so much, I will definitely return to this wonderful store for new purchases."
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"When I ordered the ring, the listing said it would take a few weeks to arrive, but we received it in 8 days! I had to wait almost 2 weeks before Etsy would leave a review, that's how fast it shipped. The ring itself is perfect, it's very light compared to a lot of modern men's rings and the comfort fit edge is very smooth. It's a little small but that's my fault for not accommodating my fiance's knuckles. We're going to take it to a local jeweler to be sized because that issue is not Pompeii's fault. Definitely recommend using these guys if you're looking for a men's ring."
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
Took exactly 6 weeks to receive these earrings but finally they arrived safely and I am loving them! Very comfortable- the posts are not too long so they do not poke behind the ear. They fit my lobe better in my second piercing- rather than the first- but that works just as well. I love anything new and different and these are certainly that! Thank you!
"Love the weight and feel of these, as well as how secure the notched posts feel. The gold is very warm and shiny, making the snakiness very subtle, which I love. Now I want them in silver too!"
"My second pair of earrings from this shop, and I doubt it will be my last! I ALWAYS get compliments whenever I wear either pair. The craftsmanship is amazing, as is the shop owners communication. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you!!"
"I love it, such beautiful craftmanship, the sodalitestone is of really high quality and love the little moon and stars on the back of the ring!!! The only problem is that I just want more and more of her jewelry- highly addictive!"
these earrings are stunningly pretty! i wish they came in silver
Beautiful earrings!
The quality is amazing. And I was sent another gorgeous pair of earring for free. Packaging is divine & shipping was very quick! Just made this my new go-to for jewelry!!!!
"If I could give 10 stars I would!! I absolutely LOVE THESE, they are perfect and just what I wanted!! They seem to be good quality (I‚Äôll update this if they aren‚Äôt) and the shipping was super fast (I live in the US). They are small just like I hoped, for reference my second lobes are 4-5mm from the piercing to the bottom of my ear. I am so glad I bought these, there was even a free gift included! Now usually when there is a free jewelry gift, it is cheaper and not something I would actually wear; but these came with little gold rocket ship earrings with green emerald stones üò≠üò≠üò≠ I love both earrings so much!!!!"
"I am really happy with these earrings, they look exactly like the pictures. They are really shiny and comfortable to wear. Excellent quality, I've been wearing them non stop and they are just perfect!!!! My favorite shop by far! I am so pleased and will be buying more stuff soon!!!! Thank you Ohana"
Omg these are perfect! I‚Äôm obsessed! I have been on the hunt for ear jacket earrings that actually hug my ear lobes and these are adjustable and fit perfect. So beautiful.
"Absolutely LOVE my single earrings, they‚Äôre amazing! and the box they come in is adorable! Favourite shop on Etsy! 5*****"
Heel mooi!!
"It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that‚Äôs to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!"
My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead- instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.
These are amazing!! Haha So pretty!!<3 I got them for my sister for Christmas and she's going to love them!! Great service!! <3 :)
"It is well made! I was hoping to wear them daily but they are uncomfortable to sleep in. I did also recently get my 2nd and 3rd piercing so that may be why. I have smaller ears so they are big and the flattened edge isn't super visible, in general with their size it is not a very noticeable feature to start. I started putting backs on while I sleep because they were coming out of my 3rd hole and I was nervous they would close up. They did come pretty quick though I was nervous about shipping they shipped fast and very super communicative."
This bracelet has become my most beloved piece of jewelry that I have ever owned. The sigil and design of the bracelet is absolutely gorgeous and classy. The quality of the bracelet is perfect and this is definitely a piece of jewelry I will cherish for a lifetime. I am absolutely in love and I wear it almost every day.
Ring is better in person and surpassed what I was expecting! Love the quality!
"Thank you for this! I bought a consecrated pentacle and anointed it with Jupiter oil from Sphere and Sundry. The next day when I wore it, I got forward movement on the thing I was worried about. Also, my stock portfolio began performing much better after a slump for the last few weeks. I'm consecrating it now at the hour of Jupiter on the Thursday by burning a candle, playing the orphic hymn to Jupiter and anointing it with more Jupiter oil."
My favourite tarot! The necklace is stunning and it arrived sooner than I expected!
tres joli et tres leger a porter

"These earrings are absolutely STUNNING. I wore them for my wedding day and I received so many compliments. It was the perfect unique and modern touch, with just the right amount of glam and elegance. You can tell they are made with a lot of attention to detail. The customer service was also fantastic and so helpful in finding just want I wanted. I'll wear them over and over!"
"Stunning pair of earrings, quality made, customer service is impeccable. Prompt production and delivery times. Highly recommend!"
Earrings are gorgeous! Received from Israel to the US in just a few days. Excellent and extremely responsive customer service as well!
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
"They were beautiful, completely handmade and so special for my baby girls nursery. I just wish I ordered more!"
Really nice. Quality folding and paper. Helps keep real birds from flying into my window.
I loved the dresses received - absolutely perfect!
"J'ai re√ßu ma guirlande ce jour et je suis enchant√©e! L'envoi est soign√© et la guirlande est r√©alis√©e avec bcp de soin. De plus, la cr√©atrice est adorable. Je suis tellement contente que je viens d'en commander une seconde. Je ne peux que recommander et mettre 5 √©toiles"
"They are beautiful, first time wearing climber earrings but they stayed on and didn‚Äôt move all day, very dainty, sparkly and eye catching, love love love them üß°"
These ear climbers are stunning! Quick delivery also. Thank you so much!
"These are so beautiful, very comfortable wear, & unique. I love them!!"
"Beautiful, and it stays on. Great shipping time."
"I fell in love with Harry Mason‚Äôs jewelry several years ago in San Francisco at the shop on the pier. I continued to purchase pieces online after my visit to San Francisco. I was very sad to learn of Harry‚Äôs passing, but was thrilled to find you here on Etsy keeping Harry‚Äôs dream going strong. These earrings are beautiful, and very well-made, as expected. This is fine, unique jewelry that always scores compliments whenever I wear any of his pieces."
This is a beautiful piece of jewelry. I love the length. I received it within 2 days of ordering
"These are my 4th pair of Harry Mason earrings. His earrings are high quality with unique one of a kind designs. Whenever I wear my Harry Mason earrings, I receive a lot of compliments. Thank you Kathryn for continuing your husband‚Äôs legacy!"
Absolutely more stunning than the photo. Super comfortable and makes my ears look like a piece of art. The shipping was super fast. Sorry to hear about Harry Mason's passing. I plan to pass these down to my daughter.
Even better in person. Got them in silver. They are a gift. Can't wait to see them on my sister-in-law. They are gorgeous!!!! Almost wanted to keep them for myself.
"So unique!! I love wearing these when I have my hair in a ponytail as they really glam up your ears. Unfortunately, right now with Covid, wearing a mask with these is annoying as they can get caught in them and you have to adjust but eventually that wont be a problem lol"
"Very nice! Took me a minute to figure out the perfect position on my ear, but thet stay in place just perfcetly."
"Beautiful earrings! Kalypso is the kindest seller I ever met on Etsy, she wrote me a little letter and gave me another pair of earrings as a gift because I was the first buyer of the year. So incredibly nice! Thank you! :)"
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
This is so pretty! The earring fits perfectly in my tragus and the flat back is easy to put it and remove. I requested a custom length and Rosec Jewels was able to accommodate. Very happy with the purchase!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
"Amazing! They are fantastic! Like the photos, but better! Love that it can actually spin."
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"Panagiotis is a skilled artisan and a wonderfully responsive seller. I had a question about the silver used in these earrings and he replied within the hour. I love that these are basically a two-in-one sort of deal - they can be worn as a stud for easy daily use, or with the jacket for a more stand-out look. And the titanium is not irritating at all. I couldn't be more pleased! Thank you very much!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
"Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day. Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!"
"Totally my favorite earrings. Such s great idea and they look just wonderful. Good quality and everyone always asks about them and compliments them. Finding this product has totally gotten me into looking and purchasing more science inspired jewelry, I love it!"
"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!
"I am really happy with these earrings, they look exactly like the pictures. They are really shiny and comfortable to wear. Excellent quality, I've been wearing them non stop and they are just perfect!!!! My favorite shop by far! I am so pleased and will be buying more stuff soon!!!! Thank you Ohana"
Omg these are perfect! I‚Äôm obsessed! I have been on the hunt for ear jacket earrings that actually hug my ear lobes and these are adjustable and fit perfect. So beautiful.
"Absolutely LOVE my single earrings, they‚Äôre amazing! and the box they come in is adorable! Favourite shop on Etsy! 5*****"

"L'orecchino e' molto bello come da immagine, ma fa fatica a restare in posizione, basta poco per farlo scendere verticale (sara' colpa del mio lobo?!). Un gommino da infilare sul retro aiuterebbe forse a mantenere la posizione corretta."
one of my favorites ear pins
Great & unique design! I love it!!! Thank you so much
<this is cute and I love the way it looks
"These are my FAVORITE earrings. They look exactly like a beautiful sunset. The colors pop and sparkle. Tiffany (the seller) picks the most incredible stones. The quality is sublime. They are light and stay perfectly in my ear. You will not find a better artist on Etsy! She is incredible. These earrings are one of kind. I bought two of them and while the sunset was the same, the colors were different in each. I get compliments on them non stop! If your looking for wearable art... this is the place!"
"This looks like a magical Caribbean sunset on the boat. It is even prettier in person than in the pictures and I have not been able to use any climbers that I have bought previously but not only did these work with my flimsy earlobes, they included directions (how freakin' clever!?!) on how to use climbers in general. I LOVE THESE."
Out-by-God-stounding. Love these earrings. Get the 7 stones. They curve EXACTLY how they're supposed to on my ears. Have no doubt they will be my every day earrings. Will be ordering from this shop again. Stones are super iridescent. Worth the wait.
"Fantastic! Arrived lightening fast given that it was custom made!!! What a stunning Artisan handcrafted design. I was actually shopping for other items, when this piece caught my eye. Especially since they were enveloping some of the most luscious of my favorite stones. The workmanship is excellent and the unique design makes this a truly one of a kind. Light and easy to wear."
I love these. They look real!
Parfait jadore h√¢te de les porter
"Adorables petits boutons dont je vais me servir pour d√©corer la couverture d'un livre. Ils sont arriv√©s rapidement et le petit ""Merci"" sur la carte de visite m√™me pour une si petite commande m'a fait plaisir (ainsi que le timbre ""Positive attitude"", il m'en faut pas beaucoup ahah) ! Merci √† vous :)"
I LOVE them!
"Cadeau de f√™te pour mon amie, qui est lion. Elle a ador√©! Merci pour elle; √ßa lui va tr√®s bien!"
"The earrings are very high quality, and came in the cutest little box! I didn't even need to wrap them to give them to my friend!"
Love the quality of the earings but be prepared to wait as delivery was quite long. However I would order again but just allow about 5/6 weeks for delivery. Ara was also very quick to get back to me re queries and concerns about delivery. Efficient and well run enterprise
Super cute! Product was as described! Can‚Äôt wait to wear them!!
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
"Magnifique ! √Ä la bonne taille, r√©sistant, brillant, je suis fan ! Un grand merci !ü•∞"
"Got these for my sister and they were the perfect gift! They are sleek, futuristic, and emanate class and beauty. Absolute must-have for the fashion-forward. Very well made and worth the wait!"
Love them! They look beautiful and are very comfortable. Thank you very much!! I might buy a few more :)
"Dainty and cute, these tiny crawlers are a beautiful and understated accent!"
so happy with the climbers!
Really awesome! I thought I was only getting one with my purchase but got two and I only have my one ear pierced so I got both on one ear and love it!
These look great!
These are so cool I love them.
"Super fun, easy to put on and wear!"
She loved it (my science woman...) but I noticed that they have sides.... you have to put the left one on your let ear and so on.... That kinda sucks a bit..... :)
interesting and novel. Nothing more to add.
"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
I absolutely love these earrings. The stone stud is the perfect size and I love the detail on the circles. I want them in onyx too!
Suited my wedding dress perfectly.
Diese Ear Climber sind sehr hochwertig gefertigt und sehen klasse aus!
These ear climbers are beauties! Rose gold is my new color and I am lovin these!
"This came in the post, (took 2weeks from order date until I received it in Portugal) and I am pleased with it. It's pretty and dainty, worth the wait! I wear it in my helix piercing but it's difficult to photograph so just for this photo I put it in my main earlobe. Seller is great and answers questions fast, thank you. Will be buying more. :)"
these are a showstopper! I love them!
The cuffs are absolutely stunning! Very well maid with lots of details.
I received the earrings and they are beautiful.
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"My daughter loved these earrings! They were a perfect size. Quality is great, they‚Äôre not flimsy. Packaging was beautiful, it felt special to give them to her for Christmas. All of the items in the boutique are similarly unique and beautiful, now a go-to spot for gifts for my girls! Thank you."
I love this ear cuff. It‚Äôs comfortable and sometimes I forget that I‚Äôm wearing it. I‚Äôve had this cuff for about 6 weeks and it has yet to tarnish.
Very cute earrings and the seller answered all my questions. Also shipped the same day!
Love them. Very stylish and pretty. Quick delivery.
I am in love with my beautiful ear climber!! I spent a lot of time looking for a high quality ear climber and I am so happy I found this. It fits on my ear perfectly and stays up all day. Can't wait to buy another!
I went back and forth and bought the one cuff and two studs. Just received them today and should have bought two cuffs and two studs. I‚Äôm in love with these!!
Obsessed!!! üíóüíóüíó
"The pictures on here are amazing but I‚Äôve been eyeballing these for months and finally bought the set. Best purchase I‚Äôve made in a long time, I am a huge turquoise fan and have big plans to wear these ladies out all the time. Turquoise is like pearls, shouldn‚Äôt leave the house without a good piece of turquoise jewelry. I can‚Äôt wait to order from here again."
"If you're looking for a pair of unique, well-crafted, and unique hoops, look no further! These are perfect for everyday (and night) wear, and I also love that they clearly stand out in comparison with mass-manufactured earrings. The seller was really lovely and accommodating, and it's obvious that she does everything with love. Thank you!"
I love these earrings so much! I got the silver large and medium triangles and they‚Äôre exactly what I was looking for. Even with COVID happening the shipment and delivery was pretty quick.
"Finally found my dream hoops! Perfect size and shape for everyday but also special occasions. High quality material, so definitely worth the price. Thank you <3"
Not only did I receive my package faster than I expected but my ring is gorgeous. The fit is perfect and the quality exceeds my expectations! (it‚Äôs the pinky ring)
"J'adore. Boucles tr√®s jolies. L√©g√®res, originales. Elles correspondent √† photo et √† la description. Colis rapide et soign√©. Merci"

Love them!
Unbelievably quick to arrive and they look great.
"I bought these earrings as a gift for my mum, they look just as lovely as in the picture! Unfortunately, my mum didn't end up liking them but the owner was fantastic and offered a return or refund. Although we didn't keep the earrings, I would certainly recommend Otis Jaxon. 5 stars for customer service."
Perfect item. Bought as a present. They loved them. I'll be back for more.

"tres bonne tres beaux bijoux , super service"
These turned out beautifully. I love them. I got them for myself by my mom ended up taking them! lol.
"I loved the look, nice piece of jewelry, love the length. I wore them a few times and then the the hook broke, and the other one slid off and that one was lost. I would love too have a post on the back, instead of a hook."
I love my earrings! I haven't stopped wearing them since they arrived :) Thank you!
Beautiful design and well made.

Bracelet tr√®s joli et discret! Je suis satisfaite de mon achat: livraison rapide et vendeuse tr√®s r√©active et agr√©able. Je recommande!
Love it! I got the purple jewel and wear it for my septum ring. It's subtle enough and unique enough. A couple friends noticed and said it's super cute and really fits my style.
"I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect out of ordering jewelry online, but this septum ring was exactly what I wanted - Perfect diameter and gauge & the color was exactly as expected. I put it next to a household key for size reference. Would order another one :)"
Love them so much !
They are so pretty! I love them.
I really love it! For my tiny ears it probably would be better if both arrows were a little bit smaller. The dimensions between lobe holes is perfect but they are a little long for my small ear. But that just means I may need to order more in a custom size üòâ truly love them!
"Absolutely love these and get so many compliments about them! They are beautiful and really good quality. Came in the most gorgeous envelope, in a little pouch and with a handwritten note. Incredible! Thank you so much!"
"This is my favorite thing I‚Äôve purchased from Etsy like EVER! Nicely packaged, makes you excited to open it. So many nice touches to the packaging. The earrings are well made and easier to put in than I thought and more comfortable than I thought they‚Äôd be. I will never take these off! ALSO amidst all of the coronavirus stuff, they came in a reasonable time frame!"
I paid for gift wrap and I was so impressed! My mum loves them and the wrapping. Especially how eco friendly it was! I had to stop her from opening them a day early. Thank you so much. Also your handwriting is beautiful!
"Sehr entz√ºckende Ohrstecker! Ich habe schon lange nach passenden Perlenohrringen gesucht und hier nun endlich f√ºndig geworden. Mit den Katzen√∂hrchen perfekt, als w√§ren sie f√ºr mich designt. Ganz liebevoll verpackt :))) Ich bestelle gerne wieder!"

"Simply gorgeous, I feel like one of the Amazonian warriors from wonder-woman."
"The seller was helpful and definitely ensured my order arrived on time for a wedding! I was so surprised at how quick it reached me. The earrings were exactly as pictured. A very small con was that I expected the earring backing to be silver too for the price and not a silicone one. None the less, they fit and sit well :) will be back again!"
"Envoi rapide. Pr√©sentation dans une petite bo√Æte soign√©e, que c'est agr√©able ! Le bijoux est tr√®s beau, merci."
"My earrings arrived on time, packaging is super cute and I love them!!!"
"I loved the first ones so much, I had to get another pair in the gold color. I love that they are adjustable (3 length settings). They fit exactly as pictured. Customer service is spot-on. I made an error in my purchase and it was pretty much fixed the next day. Shipping was great. I will be shopping here again (already have my wishlist) ;-) :-D"
‚ô•Ô∏è
These are gorgeous‚Äîand fit perfectly! Love the multiple settings! Thank you so much!
"Not only are these beautifully made, excellent quality and completely adorable, but they come in the most beautiful packaging!"
These earrings are beautiful and great quality! I had some questions about my order and Kamilah responded to me and answered my questions quickly!
These earrings are beautiful. The mixed metals allow you to pair them with any accessory. I love the active motion of the two pieces. Beautiful!
"Loving these so far! A little nervous that the pieces are not glued together so hoping I can hold on to the whole earring but overall, really pleased :)"
These earrings are perfect for dressing up an outfit. Craftsmanship on the product is excellent. I will definitely order again once the shop opens up!
"I just got these in the mail today, and they are gorgeous! I haven't had a chance to wear them yet, but as a fellow jewelry designer I can already tell they're going to look great. The quality is exquisite, as well. Highly recommend this shop! Update: I'm wearing them right now and they're GORGEOUS! I've included a picture so everyone can see how they look. They are extremely comfortable. You can't even feel them, and yet despite bouncing my head around to the tune of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" they haven't moved an inch. I myself make ear climbers and carry them in my store and I dearly hope my ear climbers are as beautiful and secure as these!"
"This seller is amazing! I would buy again for sure! The ear climbers are beautifully made. Thank you, I absolutely love themüòä"
"Super cute, fits great. :D 10/10 would recommend!"
2nd pair! Beautiful
Absolutely love them!!!
Very cute set! I just have very narrow edges i guess but i do still love the look!!!
"This is my second purchase; I have already purchase this item in silver, and I liked it so much, I ordered one in gold."
These earrings quickly turned from gold to silver after only wearing them a couple of times. So sad because I really liked them. I‚Äôm not very optimistic that another pair would be better. This was my first purchase from this shop so I‚Äôm hesitant to buy more. :/
I‚Äôm so appreciative and satisfied!!! These climbers are literally apart of me honestly. Thank you!!!
"I have very small ears so I was worried that these would not fit or that they would hurt my ears, but I was pleasantly surprised at how light they were. I almost forgot that I was wearing them from the moment I put them on. They also came extremely fast and when I had a question for the seller she responded at lightning speed. Thank you for these beautiful earrings."
"I was looking forever for the perfect east climbers and these are everything I wanted. The look, the fit and the material ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Absolute love the earrings!!!
Perfect ear cuff I searched and searched for one that was simple and this was it! Very fast shipping too!
I actually bought this about a year ago in rose gold and have since bought another in white. These are def the most comfortable and so shiny and pretty. I had to buy one in white gold for my white gold ensemble!
I absolutely love this ear cuff. So much so that when I thought I lost the first one I ordered a second. When my husband found the first I giggled because I was so happy that I was getting another.
Quickly became my favorite piece of jewelry.
"Stacey was wonderful to deal with. She went into shop on a Sunday just to wrap and post the gorgeous earrings I purchased, in order for them to ship in time for my mom's birthday. The earring were high quality and polished up beautifully. I recommend PS jewellers. Excellent customer service!"
Great product. Fast shipping.
Magnifique comme toujours autant le bijou que l'emballage
Envoi soign√© et agr√©able √† ouvrir. Les boucles d'oreilles sont l√©g√®re √† porter. Parfaite
"J?ai achet? des boucles d'oreilles pour mon mariage. Elles sont parfaites. Merci pour vos conseils, vos photos envoy?es en complement et votre envoi rapide."
"I LOVE THIS SHOP! I ordered 3 items from here. For a start, all my questions were answered almost immediately after me contacting the seller - hardly any wait time. I requesting some modifications, all of which were happily accomodated. I paid for my items, and regardless of international shipping, received them shortly thereafter. On receiving them items, I LOVED THEM! They were just as beautiful in person as they were viewed online. I am so happy. I would highly recommend purchasing from this shop. Communication was fast and effective, and the jeweller does beautiful work."
I have just received a pair of these beautiful climbers and I couldn't help but write a review straight away. These sterling silver climbers are delicate yet sturdy. They look like they've been made with care and precision. Definitely very high quality. Love them. I will take a photo of how pretty they look soon and put that up to but definitely recommend these to anyone in doubt. O' and thank you Amy for the quick delivery - I really appreciate that :)
"I have bought 1 set, lost 1 of the earrings of that set haha, and then HAD to buy a replacement because I love them so much. They're so simple but fashion forward and cool. Super easy to wear - they typically DON'T fall out (the one that fell out fell out on a night of moderate drinking so who knows what happened to it - my fault, not the earrings). I wear them all the time and I don't take them out at night when I sleep. Also this seller is so nice - it comes in a little box & the craftmanship is really good. Shipping is fast. <3 it"
"I love my ear climber! It arrived only 3 days after I ordered it and looks just as pictured. A bit snug at first (which is what you want so it's secure), but then you can't even feel it on your ear. Thanks for such a cute piece, Squirrels Nest Jewelry! ^__^"
LOVE my new jewelry (sent with a handwritten note from Amy). I wondered how an ear climber would look in a second piercing - perfect! I'm wearing sterling smooth ear climber and sterling open hoop both from SNJ.
Jolies petites boucles d'oreilles ! Elles sont bien arriv√©es et la personne √† qui je les ai offertes est ravie ! Merci !
Magnifique. Tr√®s belle qualit√©. Tr√®s grande r√©activit√© et bel emballage. Parfait pour mes noces de cuir !!! Merci beaucoup :-)
Superbe qualit√©. Excellent contact et livraison rapide !!! Je recommande vivement üëçüòä
Very cute and lightweight earrings that will match my poppy shirt! Well made leather earrings. I would recommend this shop.
Such beautiful and well made pieces of jewelry! Wore them NYE and got tons on compliments. Thank you so much!
Wow. Just wow. These earrings look beautiful and are fantastic quality and design. I'm so thrilled with them. I am sure I will be ordering from you again! Thank you! I also received the matching moon bracelet as a Christmas present and it is absolutely beautiful. The craftsmanship is superb. Thank you so much Kathy!
"Vraiment super beau et une belle finition, je les porte tous les jours, elle ne sont pas trop lourde et vraiment confortable ! Un gros merci √† l'artiste ! üòÅ‚ô•Ô∏è"
My new favorite pair of earrings! They are also quite light and don‚Äôt weigh my ears down. I barely notice them which is perfect for someone who has sensitive ears. I love them!
"My second pair of earrings from this seller. Absolutely lovely quality materials and design. My ears are very sensitive and these don't irritate at all, thank you so much! üòä"
"These earrings are AMAZING. I wear them everyday and don‚Äôt need to take them out to shower or sleep. I have then looped through both my love piercings and it looks adorable, I get so many compliments ‚ò∫Ô∏è best part is I‚Äôm not allergic to them and I have VERY sensitive ears!"
I love these earring so much ! They are absolutely beautiful!!!
These are so simple and the perfect size. I love them!
I love it!!! Super cute and it came on time. The only thing I didn‚Äôt know was that it doesn‚Äôt come in as a pair but everything else was great. Totally getting another one
I am obsessed with these earrings - they are so dainty and perfect with every outfit! Thanks!
My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead- instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.
"It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that‚Äôs to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!"
These are amazing!! Haha So pretty!!<3 I got them for my sister for Christmas and she's going to love them!! Great service!! <3 :)
"It is well made! I was hoping to wear them daily but they are uncomfortable to sleep in. I did also recently get my 2nd and 3rd piercing so that may be why. I have smaller ears so they are big and the flattened edge isn't super visible, in general with their size it is not a very noticeable feature to start. I started putting backs on while I sleep because they were coming out of my 3rd hole and I was nervous they would close up. They did come pretty quick though I was nervous about shipping they shipped fast and very super communicative."
"Mickey Head stud is received is different than pictured but I like it better, each ear and the head are a solid stone- each earring is made with 3 stones and just looks gorgeous!"
My daughter loved her beautiful necklace for her 20th birthday and having her birthstone was a lovely touch. She said she will always treasure it. Thank you so much East West Creations üôè
I absolutely love it!!! it's perfect!!
"Beautiful jewellery, great quality and shipped really quickl. The colours in the picture were almost exactly as they were in real life and matched my wedding dress and colour theme perfectly! Would definitely buy from here again and recommend to friends and family :-)"
Absolutely beautiful! I am so glad I have found the perfect earrings.
Beautiful earring set! High quality. Seller was very helpful and worked with me when I had an issue. Can't wait to wear them out!
These are absolutely stunning!
"I absolutely love Virginia's designs - they are simple, elegant, striking, and unique all at once. I purchased several pairs of earrings because I just couldn't pick a favorite. I cannot wear any of them without getting compliments. I'm sure I'll treat myself with more her beautiful pieces in the future and will recommend this shop to anyone who asks in the meantime. Thanks so much!"
Simply.Adorable.Period. Only piece of jewelry I have ever gotten compliments on.
"This has become my favorite place to get ""real"" jewelry. Amazing design (I can't find anything else like it) and quality product (stands up to daily wear). I now (happily) own @ 20 pieces of Virginia Wynne's work."
"I absolutely adore these earrings! They are so unique, what a clever idea. I have not been disappointed by anything I have purchased from VirginiaWynne. I intend to make more purchases from this site in the future."
i‚Äôm in love with my new earings. the quality is solid. they are super light weight which is hard to find in statement jewelry. wonderful customer service. thank you so much:)
"Ladies, I‚Äôm telling you.. the best light weight earrings and gorgeous. It can be complimented as casual and dressy! Best purchase to add to my jewelry wear."
"I love these earrings. I was looking for something like this for a while and I'm really glad I went with these ones. They are really light weight, don't irritate, and are comfortable even though they long. They make a great statement piece and still work if you have additional piercings. Highly recommend the earrings, they came faster than estimated and were beautifully packaged."
"These earrings are BREATHTAKING. The packaging was pristine and super neat, came with a lovely hand written note. The card the earrings are attached to is high quality and beautiful watercolor. I am so happy with this purchase and so excited to wear my new earrings! Thank you so much!!! :) I am so happy to be one of your first dozen orders!"
"Delicate, feminine and pretty. These earrings will dress up jeans or be the added touch to that little black dress...which is exactly why I wanted them...to go with anything. I am very pleased with these lovely earrings."
Beautiful! I wear it with the matching ear cuff/chained earring.
Shipped very late- but communicated well. Beautiful earrings!
Love these earrings! Quick shipping too
"The crawlers are great. They shipped in time and came in good packaging. The only concern I have it when I‚Äôm taking it off, I‚Äôm scared I might snap it. Overall, these are very cute!"
Very cute and looked just like what I expected! Shipping was very quick and the item packaging was very cute as well! Seem a little flimsy but still very nice.
Unique & perfect! Arrived quickly & nicely packaged. Thank you!
Very cute every day earrings! I love the simplicity.
These earrings are awesome! I love the look of them and that you can change them so the curve faces inward or outward. I also love the packaging and how sweet SteamyLab is. Thank you so much!!!

These are so amazing! I keep getting compliments everywhere I go! I was a little nervous about the metal since I have sensitive ears but I haven‚Äôt had any issues! I bought these in both colors. They are both super secure and pretty lightweight! The customer service was so great too! Get yourself a pair girl!

Would definitely recommend and I've directed a few to this page! I have to hide these from my mother ha ha maybe I'll have to get another pair for mother's day ü§î
I love these earrings that look like Bing cherries! They hang perfectly and are a great size.
Absolutely more stunning than the photo. Super comfortable and makes my ears look like a piece of art. The shipping was super fast. Sorry to hear about Harry Mason's passing. I plan to pass these down to my daughter.
Love these ear climbers! Got them in the blue opal also! Thanks Kathryn!!
Absolutely Gorgeous! Love these eat fancies
My first pair of ear climbers! Amazing and so comfortable to wear!!
Parfait
"Beautiful earrings! Thank you, I am pleased!"
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
"They were beautiful, completely handmade and so special for my baby girls nursery. I just wish I ordered more!"
Really nice. Quality folding and paper. Helps keep real birds from flying into my window.
I loved the dresses received - absolutely perfect!
"J'ai re√ßu ma guirlande ce jour et je suis enchant√©e! L'envoi est soign√© et la guirlande est r√©alis√©e avec bcp de soin. De plus, la cr√©atrice est adorable. Je suis tellement contente que je viens d'en commander une seconde. Je ne peux que recommander et mettre 5 √©toiles"

One word for these little earring climbers: GORGEOUS! Understated beauty!
"Lovely earrings, very different! I love them ‚ù§"
"Really beautifully crafted items to wear on my wedding day. Exactly as pictured, gorgeous! Can‚Äôt wait to wear them - thank you!"
Stunning earrings.
Purchased these with hoop earrings with the same beads. Love wearing them all together!
"Super leuke oorbellen ...hippe kleurtjes , snelle levering en mooi verpakt . Dank je wel :) ben er blij mee !"
"my first earpins, very cute! :)"
I really like these. Thank you.
Bien re√ßu !!! MERCI !
"I have been looking EVERYWHERE for these earrings. Not only did these cost less than my other options but the QUALITY IS BETTER. Better than Nordstrom and kate spade options. Sparkly and stunning. Great for every day with jeans or to wear out to dinner, weddings and prom."
Absolutely beautiful!!! So happy with my purchase. I've gotten many compliments already. Earrings are well constructed with extreme attention to detail. Very talented designer!! Highly recommended seller.
"Shipping was a bit delayed, but seller responded immediately. The earrings are gorgeous and quality is phenomenal. Would buy again."
This came out exactly the way I wanted it. It's really cute & she even custom made me s matching stud for the other ear. Would definitely purchase from her again.
"Just as pictured. The blue chalcedony is absolutely lovely with the 22k plating. So comfortable! If you're ordering from the U.S., be patient... I think they took a while to clear customs. Shipping was 19 days from notification. Then again, Kazikstan is very far from Boston!"
"These are the coolest earrings I have ever owned, in my life. Thank you so much! I really feel I am myself when I have them on. They are very well made, and very delicate. I will cherish them forever with care."

Love these! One of my new favorites!
"It quickly oxidized and the backing was way too loose. Love the look of this piece, just wish the material was better quality."
"The earrings with the back ring attached to the earring back was a good idea in theory. I almost gave up on trying to get them on; the post didn‚Äôt really match the backing and was really hard to get it set right. It would have been nice if the back couldn‚Äôt travel around the ring part. I wore them for 8 hours, and the earrings have already begun to oxidize and left black residue in my piercing. Sorry! Dana"
"Beautiful! Bought these as a Christmas gift, and I'm very pleased. Very nicely packaged as well. Can't wait to gift these!"
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
These earrings are the perfect chic and romantic addition to my helix piercing. The diamonds are very high quality and the shipping and production is incredibly fast. They are total statement pieces that stand out from any other diamond earrings on the market. The seller checks in with you every step of the way. I guarantee you will be beyond ecstatic with your order! This is the 6th pair I have ordered and this shop never disappoints!
This is so pretty! The earring fits perfectly in my tragus and the flat back is easy to put it and remove. I requested a custom length and Rosec Jewels was able to accommodate. Very happy with the purchase!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
These earrings are awesome. They're really eclectic and funky!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
These are actually too large and I can‚Äôt get them through my ear lobe ha! Not a problem I‚Äôve ever run into before... but they‚Äôre cute!
"I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them."
I love these earrings!! I wear them almost everyday. This was my first purchase on etsy and I cannot be more satisfied. Thanks Arajera!!
"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
"I really liked my earrings. They're a bit bigger on me than on the model, but I do have small ears. They also arrived a bit on the late side, but I did order them during the holidays, and the shop owner was very attentive about the situation, so I'm still giving a five star review. Very pretty! And sturdy!"
"These are really lovely, look very striking. The earrings themselves are shaped like a hair grip and you can adjust the fit to make sure they stay in place. Very pleased with them, thank you!"
SO PRETTY! And very comfortable - I've fallen asleep in them a couple of times without realising they were still in.
"delicate and minimalist, love them!"
Bought as a gift- arrived so quickly and the earrings are beautiful and amazing quality.
"I loved them so much in the silver set I had to get the gold set as well! I love them ! perfect size, shape and they all stay very nicely! They were delivered super fast from Israel! Get many compliments when I wear them!"
Love the ear crawlers and cuffs. Delicate and pretty. Seller is easy to communicate with and keeps you updated on shipping. Came in pretty quickly and encountered no problems. Will buy from again
"Beautiful when on. I got tons of compliments. Unfortunately they are not adjustable which is good because they look more high end, but bad because they fall off quite a bit. Specifically, the two line ear cuff. I would place it on my ear and within a couple of hours it would fall off. Sometimes I was able to find it on the floor but this last time it is lost for good. I've had it about a month and only got to enjoy it for that long. **Update** The seller reached out to me and offered to fix the issue, She is very professional and friendly. I am happy to give her my business time and time again."
Beautiful pieces and very well made! I get so many compliments on my ear pieces!
I was so excited when these earring finally arrived today! I really like these ear pins. I'm so thankful that the ear pins I buy from arajear fit my ears and that they're sterling silver. I love her store!!
I got these for me and I LOVE THEM. They look so great and are very well made. LOVE.
Love my earrings-they go with everything!
"Very neatly designed and comfy to wear all day everyday! I love them, simple and classy!"
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
"Magnifique ! √Ä la bonne taille, r√©sistant, brillant, je suis fan ! Un grand merci !ü•∞"
"Panagiotis is a skilled artisan and a wonderfully responsive seller. I had a question about the silver used in these earrings and he replied within the hour. I love that these are basically a two-in-one sort of deal - they can be worn as a stud for easy daily use, or with the jacket for a more stand-out look. And the titanium is not irritating at all. I couldn't be more pleased! Thank you very much!"

Super cute and very comfortable! Exactly what I wanted! Thanks!
The quality matches the photo and description - they are fantastic!
"Malgr√© une petite p√©rip√©tie de transport (une boule d'oreille √©tait cass√©e), le service √©tait tout √† fait au rendez-vous avec l'envoi d'une boucle de remplacement dans la foul√©e. Elles sont tr√®s jolie et semblent de belle facture. Merci"
Such a gorgeous pair of earrings! LOVE the nature inspired design with seeds. So delightful and unique. Will be back for more from this shop! üòä
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
superbes boucles d'oreilles correspondent aux photos
"This ear cuff earring is gorgeous! When I first bought it, the cuff part wouldn't stay in place and kept hanging down. I wrote to the seller, and she figured out a solution, by making the back of the cuff adjustable similar to some pierceless earrings. She sent me the new one free of charge, and it's perfect!"
These ear climbers are beauties! Rose gold is my new color and I am lovin these!
"This came in the post, (took 2weeks from order date until I received it in Portugal) and I am pleased with it. It's pretty and dainty, worth the wait! I wear it in my helix piercing but it's difficult to photograph so just for this photo I put it in my main earlobe. Seller is great and answers questions fast, thank you. Will be buying more. :)"
"They were beautiful, completely handmade and so special for my baby girls nursery. I just wish I ordered more!"
Really nice. Quality folding and paper. Helps keep real birds from flying into my window.
I loved the dresses received - absolutely perfect!

love these and they get noticed! I can also wear them with other stud earrings - I have some large faux-diamond ones that look great with this jacket.
"Lovely earrings in a modern, edgy style"
Beautiful and well made X
Beautiful earrings and they arrived promptly! Very pleased.
Love them!!!!
I love the earrings! They are beautiful! Now I‚Äòm hooked and need to buy more :)
"I have ruined my ears with gauges in the past, the holes are small but still too big for regular earrings these work so perfectly, they are so beautiful in person and well made!! So perfect for my wedding day. Came very quickly, my only criticism is the packaging. Could be more nicely packaged it up. But the earrings themselves were not damaged or anything at all."
Lovely earrings. Packed up in cute little boxes too. Seller had been in touch to advise about very long shipping time between US and UK which was very helpful. Package delivered safely and much quicker than anticipated.
"This is really like 4.5! My earlobes are apparently small since the spikes dangled way below them. I did contact Jasmine and responded quickly. I had to bend the earrings to fit (all while hoping I would not break them). They fit now but I still have to straighten them out a little. All in all, super responsive customer service and shipping. The earrings I ordered are all very nice quality."
"Love these little rays of sunshine. Great quality. Fits nicely to the lobe, comfortable, boho-chic. They add style without overwhelming a look üòä"
Best best best! I wanted earrings I can wear and not take off; these are it! They don‚Äôt stain my ears and super comfy: I don‚Äôt even remember I‚Äôm wearing them most of the time.
Stunning high quality ratings shipped impressively fast! Definitely my everyday go to.
I love these beautiful crawler earrings! They are the second pair of crawlers that I have purchased.AND..i have my eye on a few more. Very satisfied... With my purchases and the great customer service. Try a pair...you'll love them.
So lovely and delicate! Exactly what I wanted!

These are lovely and delicate. I got them as a gift for my cousin and I think she's going to love them!! Plus Virginia was helpful when there was a little issue. Thank you so much!!
Beautiful earrings! I love them!!! They were packaged beautifully too.
i‚Äôm in love with my new earings. the quality is solid. they are super light weight which is hard to find in statement jewelry. wonderful customer service. thank you so much:)
"Ladies, I‚Äôm telling you.. the best light weight earrings and gorgeous. It can be complimented as casual and dressy! Best purchase to add to my jewelry wear."
"I love these earrings. I was looking for something like this for a while and I'm really glad I went with these ones. They are really light weight, don't irritate, and are comfortable even though they long. They make a great statement piece and still work if you have additional piercings. Highly recommend the earrings, they came faster than estimated and were beautifully packaged."

I am so happy with this purchase and so excited to wear my new earrings! Thank you so much!!! :) I am so happy to be one of your first dozen orders!"
"They are the perfect size, and the detail is way better than I was expecting. My mom is a RN and I bought her these for Christmas. I can't wait to give them to her, she is going to love them!!"
My daughter loved her beautiful necklace for her 20th birthday and having her birthstone was a lovely touch. She said she will always treasure it. Thank you so much East West Creations üôè
I absolutely love it!!! it's perfect!!
"First pair of earrings arrived with one that wasn‚Äôt entirely painted and it was noticeable. I contacted bitaa and she agreed to send me one replacement earring the next day. Well it actually took close to 3 weeks before the replacement was received. Upon inspection of the replacement earring there were also flaws. These are cute, if only they were completely painted. In all fairness bitaa was accommodating for the most part, but did not ship the replacement in the time frame promised. This meant I couldn‚Äôt get the earrings to my granddaughter in time for Easter, as she was traveling and they would not have made it in the mail. So I have one perfect Easter egg earring and two which are blemished. Probably won‚Äôt order from here again."
"Beautiful and simple, thank you"
"So so cute! It's dainty enough to wear with everything, but when it catches the light, you can see the zig-zig. Had a few compliments and couldn't recommend buy it enough!"
"More beautiful than I expected, I bought 2 rings for my index fingers and I am in love. The silver is very bright and shiny, the ring so delicate. Will have to see if it is durable as i wear them, but for the price and craftsmanship I will definitely be buying more !"
Horrible the item changed color in a day and tarnished .Highly upset
"Wonderful, lovely and shinny. Perfect for a traugus. Not a master photographer but it looks great."
Perfect! I love it and the seller is super sweet. Definitely will purchase more items in the future. I will upload a picture after my piercing appt for ref. :)
I absolutely love my little triangle CZ stud earring. I even attached a chain to it to switch the look up and it works really well. Will order from this shop again :)
I love these earrings! They are so cute and very high quality! I also really appreciate the design of the stud - the were really easy to put in and don‚Äôt have a very small piece. Would definitely purchase from here again.
"Magnifique en bleu aussi. Super sympa, √ßa change."
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
Magnifique!!! Content de mon achat!!! livraison rapide!! merci!!
"Bonjour, Je viens de recevoir les boucles d'oreilles! Je suis ravie et h√¢te de les porter...Ma soeur va s√ªrement me les piquer aussi üòä‚ù§"
Excellent Service. Thank you.
"Beautiful brooch its one of those pieces to treasure ,very good communication with the seller and quick delivery excellent."
"Arrived quickly, well-packaged, and as described. Thank you!"
"Very fun, large statement ring, fast shipping."
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©"
"I ADORE the white topaz ear pins! I bought a pair instead of just the one. I wore them out to dinner last night and I was stopped by several people and asked about them. I have my ears pierced 15 times, so ear cuffs and crawlers dont really work for me. I will definitely be ordering some more similar items from this shop. Beautiful!"
Les boucles d'oreilles sont vraiment sublimes et la grandeur est parfaite. Je recommande.
"Magnifique BO belle qualit√© d'argent. envoi rapide, Patricia est charmante et tr√®s r√©active. Je recommande cette Boutique. Moune"
Das Armband ist wundersch√∂n und der Kontakt sehr nett!!! Alles super!!!
"Magnifique collier bien fourni et tr√®s bel effet autour du cou, belle qualit√© d'argent. Envoi tr√®s rapide et emballage parfait. Patricia est charmante et r√©active. Je recommande cette Boutique. Moune"
"They‚Äôre beautiful, dainty and fit my ears perfectly. I‚Äôve only worn them for a few days consecutively at this point but so far so good."
I‚ÄôM ABSOLUTELY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE OF THESE BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS AND I RECOMMEND THIS SHOP AND SELLER FOR ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR GORGEOUS JEWELRY ITEMS
"I like it, nice, very delicate."
"Absolutely love this thank you so much. 100% recommend! Excellent communication, fab quality product and speedy delivery! ü§©"
Love it
Adorable and an easy way to add some pizazz to existing jewellery. The seller is so fab!
"Very pretty, just a bit fiddly to put on, and make sure you read the description properly - I didn‚Äôt realise it was just the chain - but fit my normal stud perfectly. Lovely customer service too."
"Oh wow! J'ai re√ßue ma commande tr√®s rapidement! Tr√®s bel emballage , mignon et professionnel. Les boucles d'oreilles sont magnifiques. Conformes aux photos sur le site. Elle sont belles et de bonne qualit√©. Je les adore! Je recommande sans h√©siter!!! Merci beaucoup !"
"After one month asking where my order is, he first sent it.....very disappointed.....chain is NOT real silver!"
"nickel, carr√©e tout est simplement plus que correct, pour les papillons plus joli en vrai que sur la photo, merci de votre hyper rapidit√©, boutique en favori pour ma part!!! a bientot"
"Excellent surprise. Emballage soign√©, charm's tr√®s bien prot√©g√©s. Qualit√© excellente et rend vraiment bien, donne un air un chic !!!! Je recommande ce vendeur. Merci ;)"
Ils sont parfaits ! Et merci pour le petit cadeau que je me suis empress√©e de porter ! C'est super gentil !
Came quickly and was as described.... love how it is adjustable.... not a big fan of the backing because I hate this type of backing but the earring is so pretty I don't mind it in this case ! Totally would order again from seller
Zart und dezent aber eine Ausstrahlung wie reine Brillianten. Ein toller Ohrschmuck. Alles super gelaufen und auf alle F√§lle das Warten und den Preis wert. Ich st√∂bere demn√§chst wieder bei Etsy... Vielen Dank f√ºr diese Bereicherung.
"Beautiful earrings and incredible customer service, thank you! Would highly recommend"
Very cute!
"I adore these earrings! I bought a different pair from someone else where the part that went through your ear was shaped like a paperclip - very rounded and curved. The part that showed on the earlobe was a straight line. This earring has more of a ""square"" shape that goes through your ear (with slight corners) which allows more room for the lobe and it feels so much more comfortable. In addition, the slight curve of the part that sits on your earlobe is a lot more flattering, I think, than the straight ones from the other seller. This is a terrific earring! I'm going to get the silver as well. These stay put, too. The seller packaged the items nicely and they shipped quickly. Very happy!"
I love my earring! I had one similar to this one and lost it. So glad I was able to find another. This one is much more comfortable than the one I had before from a different seller. This one I can‚Äôt even tell its there it is some light and comfortable!
I have my own jewelry line but when I saw this I fell in love immediately! Now that I have it in my ear I know this will be an item I wear ALOT! So in love with it and will back to buy more! Thanks!
"The gold is very light and almost similar to the silver version of this earring, but still beautifully made. I love having one pair in each color so that I can coordinate with the rest of my jewelry. Fast shipping as well. Thank you!"
"Well made!!! This style of earring is something new for me. I usually wear hoops, and I wanted something different...they have more style then just stud earrings. Very pleased! Thank you!"
"I love these! Bought the gold for my sister and silver for me, but I'm keeping the gold. These are simple, yet so beautiful! They look great in my second piercing. They shipped lightening fast and were packaged in a beautiful box. I hope Jill keeps making these forever because I will be buying more!"
"Love these earrings! So simple, delicate and perfect for everyday. I was on the hunt for something that goes with everything and doesn't have a back poking me constantly. I've already shared the link with friends and family. To top it off, very fast shipping!"
This fit perfectly on my tiny ears!
Tr√®s jolie parure qui se porte tous les jours pour n'importe quelle occasion la personne qui s'occupe de la boutique et d'une extr√™me gentillesse et ne regarde pas √† se d√©mener pour vous faire plaisir je vous recommande d'aller visiter sa boutique. Merci beaucoup Laure √† bient√¥t Nadia

I just received these earrings and have already tried the backs/jackets on with so many different pairs of earrings. They are so versitile. They look especially fabulous with the earrings they came with AND several others I've purchased from this awesome shop. I LOVE this shop! Excellent quality and unique designs! Thank you!
"Just like the other earrings I ordered from this seller, these are so unique! I love them. The fact they can be worn 3 different ways is great. I will definitely be back again!"
"I'm a repeat customer -- Love this shop and its product. Special, quality pieces that I wear every day."
"This has become my favorite place to get ""real"" jewelry. Amazing design (I can't find anything else like it) and quality product (stands up to daily wear). I now (happily) own @ 20 pieces of Virginia Wynne's work."
Simplement superbe! Le format 2 en 1 est original et le look est super √©l√©gant. Je les adore et je me suis command√©e un bracelet de la m√™me collection.
Les plus belles boucles d'oreilles. La qualit√© est superbe!
Elles sont trop belles !
"Absolutely beautiful earrings, so creatively designed and so incredibly feminine. The entire transaction was smooth and shipping was fast! Claudine Moncion's designs are unique, timeless and beautifully made."
"Superbe boucles, je suis ravie de cet achat ! Je recommande :)"
Tr√®s jolie ! De tr√®s jolies couleurs pour l'automne. Beau travail !
These front and back earrings are lovely! I think I got the last pair. I have worn them three times already! They look beautiful on! I am a big fan of Petit Delights and love to look at all the beautiful offerings. I have several pairs of earrings and will continue to shop here! Merry Christmas to all and a Happy and Blessed New Year!
Arrived faster than estimated. Beautiful and high quality jewelry. Great purchase!
"Very quick delivery, and they look exactly like the photo. I plan on buying another pair very soon!"
The earrings I purchased are beautiful and they arrived very quickly. I would purchase from iloniti again.
We are a shop based on Paraguay and absolutely love maya Valentino jewelry!! They have the best customer service and great quality!! Thank you üôèüèª
My sister loved the ear crawler
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
Vielen Dank f√ºr die passenden Ohrringe zur Kette. Sie sind wie die Kette wundersch√∂n geworden. Ich freue mich schon beides zu meiner Hochzeit zu tragen. Thank you Shirli. The earrings are stunning like the necklace. I'm happy and looking forward wearing both things on my wedding day.
Shipped much faster than I expected. Had some adjustment in my cartilage piercing for a couple of days (the piercing size is a bit larger than a normal earring I think) but I love this - wear it every day now!
Delivery was flawless. The piece is beautifully crafted and looks lovely. However for me it is too uncomfortable to wear often. The back isn‚Äôt flat and uses a thick butterfly clasp to secure it which isn‚Äôt what I normally wear. The post is long and sticks out way too far from behind my ear. I have some tools and was able to shorten the post to make it more make it more comfortable. That isn't better for me as because the post is very thick and it is hard to get it into my piercing. So I will try to file the post thickness down next. The piece was a pricey investment and would like to figure out a way to wear it. These details are my personal preference however and would encourage you to purchase the piece and wear it yourself. I am highly sensitive and find I notice how things feel more rather than how they look.
"I love this so much! Fits perfectly (was even able to customize it to fit my piercing height), and I love how it Complements my other earrings. Seller was friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend!"
"My ring was finished and shipped out in under the stated time which was great because I was so excited to receive it. The shipping was also very quick, under four days to get to me in the United States. The ring was packed well and it comes in a beautiful and professional ring box and everything. The ring itself is absolutely gorgeous. Every part is flawless. The diamond shape is completely clear and immediately recognizable. The width of the band is perfect and the size was spot on too. It was polished up nice and shiny. I cannot say enough good things about my experience here. The owner is friendly and makes beautiful And creative pieces. Thank you so much! I am so happy with my ring."
"Classic timeless bangles. They are just perfect. The right size, a nice weight to them. The 14k YG 6 cm size weighs about 10 grams each, we weighed them on our cooking scale for fun because they are so nice, the set of 3 is just over 30 grams. She has wanted a set of bangles forever! Not the hollow ones or the thin bendable things that are everywhere but solid sturdy ones just like these are. Bangles that will stand up to everyday wear year after year. They make a sweet sound as she moves about. I smile hearing where she is when I'm home. One can feel the handmade quality as fingers are run around the circumference yet they look just as perfect, smooth and round as can be. She loves them, I can tell, she's not just saying so. I hope to be able to add to her set over time. A very special addition to our world together. Thank you!"
"Gilat designed and created this especially for me and I could not be more in love with it. She designed both my engagement ring and my wedding band, so I know if I need beautiful and unique jewelry, she is the only person I think of. Thank you, Gilat!!!"
"I'm very excited for my beautiful earing, Thank you so much Gilat for answering all my inquires and sending out the package so fast! I love my new earing and after i received tham i can say thay are high qulity. I really recommend this store!!"
"Une belle association de mat√©riaux et un joli contraste de couleurs. Agr√©ment√© de ce superbe colibri <3 ce pendentif ne pouvait qu'illuminer mon coeur ! Je recommande bien volontiers ce cr√©ateur talentueux, super sympa et adorable !!! Bravo Eric et Merci :)"
Really unusual earrings! Love them
Absolutely gorgeous!! I‚Äôm so happy with both of my orders!! And the customer service was fantastic!! Thank you so much!!
I absolutely love this pendant! I have a thing for hearts and this is so artistic. The first day I wore it a woman stopped me to comment on how lovely it is!
"LOVELY! Delicate looking, but well-made."
"Perfect little Arkansas necklace! I wore it to a bridal shower for my neice in Arkansas, my home state"
The necklace is so beautiful and it sparkles so nice. I got so many compliments about it the first day I wore it out!
Purchased the gold link bracelet and it by far exceeded my expectations! It looks great in the photos but in person it‚Äôs so much prettier. Love the minimalist style! I don‚Äôt wear much jewelry but this I‚Äôll keep on always :)
"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"
"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ma commande qui est arriv√©e dans un temps record ! De plus, Marjolaine est vraiment tr√®s gentille, elle avait joint un petit cadeau en plus, et l'article command√© √©tait emball√© √† la perfection. Je recommande vivement cette SUPER Boutique de notre si belle √ÆLE DE BEAUTE !!"
en ce moment je n ai pas de chance avec mes commandes ! je n ai pas re√ßu ce que j ai command√© ! pour ce faire pardonner j ai re√ßu un petit cadeau : petit tr√©s petit .... √ßa m a fait sourire ; mais je ne suis pas fach√©e et cela ne m emp√®che pas de faire mes modestes cr√©ations Merci √† tous sinc√®res sympathie .... Anne Marie
Un seul mot : parfait !! Au del√† de mes esp√©rances je devais recevoir ce cadeau entre le 20 et 23 je l‚Äôai re√ßu le 17 et √ßa a beaucoup plu . Bravo et merci üëå
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
This shop is top shelf. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love my earring jackets and I look forward to getting more Thank you Carl you are awesome üëèüèªüòÉ
"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus"
Every piece of jewelry I‚Äôve gotten from them has been so beautiful! I can‚Äôt wait to see what else this shop will release. Shipping was within the expected time frame and no damage to any products when they arrived. Everything came just like what is shown in the pictures!
It is my first time shopping on Etsy and I am surprised by the good quality. It looks so pretty on my ears. It is not bulky and so comfortable. It goes so well with my floral print dress. I definitely recommend it to my friends! Absolutely love it!!!
It is absolutely gorgeous! It's super comfy and not heavy at all. It shines beautifully in the light and are hands down my new favourite earrings!
"Absolute winners, I'd never worn anything in this joint style before but I'm glad I decided to try it. The purchase process was smooth and efficient and the final product is beautiful and elegant."
I love these! I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on them. Shipping took longer than either the seller or I anticipated but he was quick to respond and actually sent a second pair when it looked like they wouldn‚Äôt show. The original pair showed up the next week!
These looked so cute in my friend's second ear holes with her large plugs.
"These earrings are perfect! I have gotten compliments and my STEM friends love them. I like how they hug my ear, I only wear them as climbers. I have worn them multiple days and only had to adjust them once. I will definitely consider buying from this store again, the customer service is phenomenal as well."
Perfect little earrings! The finish is great and they are the perfect size. I'm a little worried about the back coming off because I had to bend it a little to loosen it enough to get in my ear. But I think it'll be okay. Would love to purchase from them again!
"Very special earings!loved them from the time i saw them on etsy.now i got them i am more in love with them!nice joooooob , many thanks"
This whole ear cuff is so cool Super light weight on your ear Have gotten so many compliments in my 1st day wearing it thank you so much for making such a unique item
"I LOVE my earrings -- a lovely shape, size and weight. I was able to place a custom order, and Jo was fantastic to correspond with."
"Thank you.I got them quickly, in a nice gift box. My wife loved these earrings. Really special."
"I love this cuff! It‚Äôs beautifully made, the packaging is amazing and it came very quickly. Thank you!"
"richtig wundersch√∂ner Schmuck! Die Ohrklemmen sind sehr bequem zu tragen und toll gearbeitet und die Haarspange ist ein Traum! Habe sie eigentlich zum verschenken gekauft, werde sie aber vielleicht behalten oder einfach gleich noch eine bestellen..."
"Ich bin wirklich begeistert. Die Qualit√§t wirkt sehr hochwertig. Das Tragen der Klammer ist angenehm. Man merkt sie √ºberhaupt nicht. Ich hatte tats√§chlich diesbez√ºglich bedenken aber diese sind √ºberhaupt nicht eingetroffen. Danke! Auch daf√ºr, dass ihr das P√§ckchen mit so viel liebe verpackt habt"
"An sich sehr sch√∂ner Cliff und super schneller Versand! Hatte ihn den ersten Tag zuhause getestet, da sa√ü er gut und ist gef√ºhlt nicht verrutscht, daher den Tag darauf ""drau√üen"" abgehabt. Leider habe ich ihn dabei wohl sogleich verloren ohne es zu merken. Ich bin nirgends h√§ngen geblieben oder √§hnliches, das hei√üt er muss wohl recht locker gewesen sein oder wie kann ich mir das sonst erkl√§ren... Schade, ich hatte mich schon gefreut, ihn oft zu tragen, aber so traue ich mich nicht, nochmal zu bestellen, wenn die Freude dann nur so kurz ist, auch wenn ich es nat√ºrlich irgendwie selbst verschuldet haben muss."
"these earrings are even better in real life than on the photos! beautifully crafted, good quality. and you can't beat the price :) thank you arajera for making my dream (of this type of design which is hard to find) come true!"
"I LOVE THESE! These are the perfect ""leave them in and rock fabulous"" earrings. Super comfortable, (you can sleep in these no problem) and adorable in style. I'm so in love with these I'm saving up money for a second set, I'd be heartbroken if I ever lost these, or better yet get these in gold too. I'd be set for life!"
I fell in love with these earrings when i saw them and I love them even more on my ears. They are unique and absolutely adorable. And the backing of the earrings are so cool! I just wish they were a little more secure as they have slid of a couple of times since I have worn them in the last several hours.
"These are so magical. Again, extremely well made and so magical looking. These do take a bit of adjusting on the ear, but that's more my ear's fault and than the earring, haha. So so happy with these. Delivery was very good too. Arrived sooner than expected and so worth the wait! Thank you!!"
I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!
"these earrings are the cutest! i don‚Äôt have a picture of them on but they are very easy to adjust and very comfy. also i love love love the little bottle that it comes in. thank you arajera, totally worth the money!"
So beautiful. Looks like 3 piercings in one I love the look and shipping was quite swift for international! Will definitely purchase again!!
Beautiful. The shipping takes awhile - about a month for me - but totally worth the wait. These pins are excellent quality.
These earrings are beautiful and came exactly as pictured! I am very happy with them. Seller was great and communicated with me about my shipment as needed. :)
Very pretty and unique. I get a lot of compliments. Shipping took a while... each pair comes inside a cute little bottle.
"Really great earrings, took a little while to get to me, but worth the wait!"
the studs look elegant though i wish the sterling silver was more refined i guess. shipping was fast. had trouble with the local post office in uae
"Very, very pretty and worth the wait (6 weeks from order to delivery to Florida). Wish it came in 20 gauge because 18 gauge was hard to insert in my earlobes. I do understand that 18g makes for a sturdier piece. Nice!"
"I bought this as a gift, and it the receiver loves it! They look awesome and fit comfortably. Also, I ordered late and wasn't expecting to receive it in time for Christmas, but it arrived on time! That was an unexpected and completely awesome surprise. I will definitely purchase again from this shop, thank you so much!"
Super cute! Lots of compliments love them!
Love them! I get so many compliments! One was damaged originally but they sent a replacement very quickly!
"Wonderful little earrings! They are well crafted and fit perfectly. I will definitely be buying other styles, I get way too many complements not to!"
"Great ear climbers, not the same cookie cutter look as so many - the design is wonderful!"
"I love this ear climber, perfect fit and nicely designed."
I love these ear climbers! They are a great quality product and the maker put a nice touch on the delivery! I'll definitely order again from this shop! Thank you!
"I love my paw print ear pins ! I love that they came shipped in a small bottle with cork stopper - not only kept them safe in travel, but like a prize in a bottle across the ocean! :)"
I had these earrings before and I really loved them but I broke one so I was so pleased to be able to get them again. They arrived really quickly in beautiful packaging and I really recommend this seller
"It‚Äôs pretty, love it. Thank you so much!!!"
"Took a while to get here, but was well worth the wait, love the details"
"My brother's girlfriend loved these! Took some finagling to get them in, but they looked great. The posts on these are quite thick, so don't force them if you have small holes; you'll have to work up to them slowly with thicker gauge posts."
"Even though it took a while for the package to arrive, I absolutely am in love with these ear pins so it was well worth the wait! I have small ears and these still fit me pretty well!"
"The shipping time seemed reasonable for it coming from the Phillipines to Illinois. In fact it still says its in transit but I received it by the end of April. I love the earring though! I've gotten so many compliments, people definitely notice these earrings :) Thank you for your quality work!"
"So cute! Amazing quality, I love these ear crawlers. Will definitely buy more."
It took forever to get to me and the first day I put it in my ear it split in two pieces!
"I've always been a big fan of ear pins, but had a hard time finding something I liked and could wear all the time. The packaging was also really cute! Thanks! :)"
These earrings are cute and arrived nicely packaged in tiny glass bottles. perfect for gifting. i get lots of compliments on them and the delivery time was fast.
I've received so many compliments on these earrings! They stay on well and I didn't need to adjust them at all. They're my new favorite pair!
These are great! They give me the exact look I was going for. They are very pretty!
"These earrings are absolutely WONDERFUL. The look fantastic, stay in place without pinching, and are very lightweight. They are well worth the wait. I will definitely be purchasing again from this vendor."
"I had ordered the same pair of earrings a few years ago but lost it on a vacation. So I had to get another one because I just love it so much <3 although the delivery time took longer than expected due to Corona, I'm still satisfied with it! Thanks so much :)"
"They're quite gorgeous, and far more confortable than what I expected. Simple and beautiful, just as I wanted, it was totally worth it to buy them."
Arajera makes the very best ear climbers. She has great skill and whimsy in her creations and I always find just 1 more pair I need to have. She does custom work too.
Looks beautiful and exactly as it was pictured on the listing. They're perfect! Would definitely recommend to friends and family. Customer service was quick and polite. Thanks so much!
Absolutely beautiful! Love these earings!!
Great!
"Love these!! They are just what I was looking for & I get so many compliments. Only down side, the metal irritates my ears."
I love these so much! Great quality and came super fast!!
"These are beautiful simple descrete earings. Benitta Moco was so helpful because first package was lost and never arrived, so she sent a new one. I wear them since I opened the box! Thank you again!"
beautiful and dainty!...they go with any outfit!..Thank you!
"Minima Maxima came to Renegade Craft in Boston, so I had the opportunity to purchase these stunning earrings in person. They're little art pieces - and incredibly lightweight. I loved them so much that I purchased another pair on Etsy for my cousin. Arrived quickly and beautifully packaged, as well. The owners are down-to-earth and super sweet - support these fine folks!"
"I have these in silver and bought them in gold for a friend. I love the unique art deco design. They look great from the front and back, my favorites! Thanks MinMax peeps :D"
"My granddaughter loves these earrings. They're a little tricky to put on, but she mastered it in no time. A unique. beautiful look. Thank you."
"Die Ohrringe sind ziemlich gro√ü f√ºr meine Ohrl√§ppchen und pieksen dann an meinem Hals. Ich hab vier Wochen auf die Lieferung gewartet und durfte dann noch zus√§tzlich Zollgeb√ºhren bezahlen, weil es offensichtlich nicht richtig deklariert war. 37‚Ç¨ Warenpreis + 14‚Ç¨ Versand + 10‚Ç¨ Zollgeb√ºhren f√ºr ein bissl Acryl mit bissl Goldfarbe. Schade."
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
"When I ordered the ring, the listing said it would take a few weeks to arrive, but we received it in 8 days! I had to wait almost 2 weeks before Etsy would leave a review, that's how fast it shipped. The ring itself is perfect, it's very light compared to a lot of modern men's rings and the comfort fit edge is very smooth. It's a little small but that's my fault for not accommodating my fiance's knuckles. We're going to take it to a local jeweler to be sized because that issue is not Pompeii's fault. Definitely recommend using these guys if you're looking for a men's ring."
Absolutely love those earnings!!!! I was looking for something unique and I found it. They are nicely made and come in adorable packaging that can also be storage box for them. I love the fact that you can rotate tiny wind mills like you would in real life :) Overall fast delivery. Top notch. I recommend the seller.
I am absolutely in love with these! They're exactly as I imagined. I would definitely buy from this seller again!
So special!
"Such cute earrings! I ordered silver, however when I received them they were gold with purple pinwheels. However I just bought some paint from Ben Franklin and painted the pinwheels blue and the sticks silver, to match my wedding colors. n nThe pinwheels actually spin - SO CUTE! Love these earrings. n nAlso fast shipping. Great work! :)"
"The first pair I got were a lot longer than described, but Virginia was really great about sending me a new pair right away! Awesome customer service, definitely recommend this shop! Great quality earrings."
Beautifully made and simple elegant designed earrings! My 2nd purchase from Virginia. Super speedy shipping as well. Thanks!
These earrings are so cool...they look very chic and hip on the ear and I've received a ton of compliments.
"I really like these, they are a good fit for my ears."
Je suis ravie de mes boucles d'oreilles . Elles sont superbes. Je les adore! Mille mercis √† vous! bonne continuation Marie-Laure
"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."
Je suis ravie de mon achat. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et l'amie √† qui je l'ai offert l'a trouv√© tr√®s beau ! Je recommande √† 100% et n'h√©siterai pas √† repasser commande prochainement.
"Magnifique ! √Ä la bonne taille, r√©sistant, brillant, je suis fan ! Un grand merci !ü•∞"
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
Very professional! The seller privately messaged me about my earrings and shipped them very fast. I had text messages too with updates from the postal service. The earrings themselves are beautiful. Excited to wear them...the case they came in was really nice and professional looking. Their jewelry would make great gifts! Thanks and happy holidaze‚úåÔ∏èüòé
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"Beautiful, exactly as pictured. They work in my third lobe piercings perfectly. The post is a bit short, so they fit closely to the lobe, which keeps them in position. Definitely recommend!"
I‚Äôm obsessed with these!!! Thanks for the awesome quality and craftsmanship =D
Love!
"They are beautiful! I did misread the description and thought they were gold. Oh well, they still work!"
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
superbes boucles d'oreilles correspondent aux photos
Such a gorgeous pair of earrings! LOVE the nature inspired design with seeds. So delightful and unique. Will be back for more from this shop! üòä
"Malgr√© une petite p√©rip√©tie de transport (une boule d'oreille √©tait cass√©e), le service √©tait tout √† fait au rendez-vous avec l'envoi d'une boucle de remplacement dans la foul√©e. Elles sont tr√®s jolie et semblent de belle facture. Merci"
Arajera makes the very best ear climbers. She has great skill and whimsy in her creations and I always find just 1 more pair I need to have. She does custom work too.
Looks beautiful and exactly as it was pictured on the listing. They're perfect! Would definitely recommend to friends and family. Customer service was quick and polite. Thanks so much!
Absolutely beautiful! Love these earings!!
Great!
These are a joy to ware...I'm getting another pair soon!!!
They're unique and lovely. Fits perfectly with small ears. It took 20 days to arrive to Spain. Thank you!
Arrived safely! These are so beautiful and comfortable to wear...I am over the moon with them! THANK YOU! :o)
Beautiful picked up two pairs and so glad I did. Love them. Quick shipping.
The red is so vibrant. They look great on the ears. Will definitely buy more.
really lovely earrings thank you
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)"
So beautiful! And they arrived according to the maker‚Äôs timeline for making and shipping. Thanks again!
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)"
These are absolutely stunning. I feel so elegant! I have tiny ears so the birds cover pretty much the whole bottom half of my ear but I still think it looks great. They are difficult to get in unless you bend the backing to straighten out the angle quite a lot.
"I have ordered a pair of ear climbers from this artist before, was only ordering for the left ear this time to mismatch with the moonstone studs I also ordered, but Ara sent me both left and right climbers... so sweet! These climbers are fabulous and with a little bit of practice they become easy to put on. Beautifully made."
"Thank you for my new favourite earrings! I've been wearing them every day since I got them. I was worried at first they wouldn't fit my ear but they're actually perfect. The temptation to just sleep with them is very strong, I must admit. The little bottle they come with is really cute and is one of the many reasons these earrings would be perfect as a present. The shipping was a lot faster than I expected, too. So, I'm very happy on all fronts and I will definitely buy again from your shop. :D"
"Really very pretty. Was looking for ear climbers that weren't too chunky but were also not something you see everyone wearing. These are pretty, different and very well made. Am very happy with my purchase."
"My 19 year old sister-in-law loved these! Took some finagling to get them in, but they looked great. The posts on these are quite thick, so don't force them if you have small holes; you'll have to work up to them slowly with thicker gauge posts."
Gotten lots of compliments on these! Love them!!
Love them!! Very unusual design- took me a little while to get the hang of putting them on properly (I've only got small ear lobes?!!) need to open them slightly & then squeeze them into place to keep them secure. I am really pleased with them though. Shipped as expected.
"The earpins are so beautiful and pretty easy to put on. Very reasonable price for a pair. However, the item took a lot of time to arrive and the tracking wasn't updated, seller was hard to reach as well. Very cute packaging. If it weren't for the slow shipping and the difficulty to reach the seller, this would've gotten five stars."
They are as pictured and very pretty but were a gift and took weeks to arrive. I understand that's the way with international shipping though! Oh well!
"These earrings are absolutely WONDERFUL. The look fantastic, stay in place without pinching, and are very lightweight. They are well worth the wait. I will definitely be purchasing again from this vendor."

"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus"
Thank you! This style of earring was hard to find. I needed them to put together a hairspray movie inspired outfit.
"Great earrings! Lightweight and work perfect with my second piercing (not too wide, so no overlap)"
These earrings are beautiful and shipped quickly. I received many compliments and reordered as a gift. Definitely recommend!
very very shiny. from photo they appeared more of a matt finish. disappointed.
"I've been wearing this in the third hole in my left ear, so it climbs a little higher up the back of my ear. It's slightly too big for this, but I don't mind. Clearly, it's shown on the model fully on the earlobe instead of the back of the ear. I love this piece so much. It's gorgeous and I've been wearing it really often with another pair of earrings from this seller."
"These are subtle and beautiful, great for anyone who wants to try ear pins but doesn't want a look that is ""in your face."" Shipping was extremely fast, and seller stayed in communication throughout the whole process. Wonderful experience!"
"I love these earrings! They are just as pictured, came in a cute little package, and arrived quickly. I get so many compliments on them!"
"Came promptly! I love this ear climber, although Ill be purchasing the left ear as well now - it looks kinda funky just wearing the one."
These bracelets are so adorable! I get so many compliments on it! I cannot wait to see my friend‚Äôs response when she gets hers ‚ù§Ô∏è
"This is just amazing, my girl she loved it soo much !! And she is wearing it almost everyday."
Love it! Super cute on!!!
"Really sweet eye, and very friendly and efficient vendors. Thumbs up here üòÄüëç"
This is my second pair of climbers and a little dressier than the first pair I purchased which I love. I wore them first for Easter Sunday and they were subtle and dressy at the same time. Definitely my style! I am very pleased with them. And Have received a number of nice comments about them from friends.
They are beautiful! Also the service was fantastic. I will be shopping with you again. Thanks üíó
I love it. They are orginal and really gorgeous. Good quality also.
Received my order and they are everything I wanted! Love them!
"I adore these earrings!!! They are officially my favorite earrings. They are more comfortable than I originally thought they would be. The shipping was fast. Also, the packaging is adorable. The little glass vials they come in are super cute!"
I love the different shades of pink. Adds a great pop of color to your outfit.
really lovely earrings thank you
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)"
Do not buy anything from this shop! I ordered something well over 1 month ago and it still hasn't arrived. When it started shipping she said allow 3-4 weeks for shipping and it's been 4 weeks! The package still says preparing shipment in Sweden. It has been like that for weeks. Don't buy anything from here!
"Hi, just sent you a message. We are following up with my courier, but there seems to be a delay during the holidays. Kindly check your inbox. Thanks!"
"Delivery took awhile but it was hand made and came from Singapore, so it didn't really take that long. However it has a slight nick on the earring pole."
Yes i hav√© satisfaction m
Lovely earrings & quick shipping to Canada! Will buy from again!
"it took a little while to get here, but I've received several compliments on these fun earrings."
Gorgeous! Really pretty and I loved that the pieces arrived in tiny little glass bottles!
Very pleased with these earrings.
Thanks so much for the wonderful earrings. I always get compliments when I wear your styles.
"super cute, arrived fast and durable materials"
"Love them, thank you !"
"They are perfect to wear everyday, simple but very cool"
"Boucles d'oreille parfaites ! Elles tiennent parfaitement √† l'oreille, sont tr√®s originales. Tr√®s √©l√©gantes et de super qualit√©. Je les conseille √† toutes les filles. Elles font √† la fois chics et d√©contract√©es"
These ear climbers are adorable. Everything came exactly as the seller had described. I ordered another pair of climbers and they each came in an adorable little jar. The seller even included a polishing cloth. Thank you!
These climbers came promptly and have been admired every time I have worn them. I made a very slight adjustment to the end of the wire at the back to make them more comfortable and easier to put on. They came very safely packaged and in a beautiful little jar which would make them a very special gift (in this case for me!)
Leider sind sie nicht gleich und bei einem Ohrring fehlt die Stanzung in einer Blume. Trotzdem sehr niedlich aber f√ºr meine Ohren leider such zu gro√ü. Sie stehen etwas ab und halten bei mir nicht. Aufgrund der Entfernung behalte ich sie und verschenke sie evtl.
These ear climbers are beautiful and of such high quality. My best friend loved them. I adored the way the ear climbers were packaged. The note with suggestions for jewelry care was greatly appreciated. Thank you!
ich habe die Ohrringe f√ºr mein 17 j√§hriges Firmkind bestellt. Dieser Schmuck ist wirklich etwas ganz Besonderes und Pers√∂nliches. Sehr sch√∂n!
Beautiful! Ordered these as a birthday gift for a coworker who really liked my moon phase climbers. Took about a month to arrive in CA. Thank you so much!
"Beautiful simple piece, and I love that they can help balance out the empty 2nd piercing on one side of my ear versus the other. First time getting climbers, and I'm really pleased with them as they don't cause reaction either."
"Beautiful earrings. Absolutely love them. They are so cute and I have received so many compliments after only wearing them twice! I did have an issue with the material used, my ears are very sensitive. I covered the post in clear nail polish and this has resolved the issue and allows me to wear them in comfort!"
These little elephants are the cutest! My sorority's symbol is an elephant so I had to have them!
I love these!!!
"Loved these earrings and the cute little glass jar they come in! Really nice, quick delivery and friendly seller too. Thank you!"
Love! I get so many compliments on the earrings.
Great. Looks exactly as seen in pictures. Good quality and nice unique packaging.
Perfect! I love my pins.
"Second time ordering from this seller, great quality again. Love them!"
Beautiful earrings. Unique and gorgeous. Packaging is super and a really wonderful surprise.
Beautiful and delicate. Perfect x quick too.
Cannot use these on my ears. They do not stay up.
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)"
"El art√≠culo era lo esperado, me gusta mucho. Aunq se demor√≥ la entrega"
"these are great,easy to wear,very comfortable,and look great,I think the quality of everthing I have bought through etsy is brilliant."
"Cute, cute, cute! Arrived when expected. Would order from her again."
Super duper love your ear pins! Will definitely buy another pair soon. :)
Love!!!!
Omg I love love love these climbers. They are beautiful.
"Favourite of my three purchases, worn them everyday I've had them so far. Simply, elegant and gorgeous!"
Very happy with the earrings. The quality is great!
"The earing hasn't arrived yet, after my ordering of it approximately two months ago. I won't rate it, due to my inability to do so, but I will rate the shipment speed an unfortunate 1/5"
"These are my second pair of earrings from SamiJewels, and I have been impressed with both sets I have. I have been getting more into ‚Äúear climbers‚Äù as the backs stay closer to my ear than traditional stud earring backs, making them more comfortable for me. The curve of the back of these makes this pair even more comfortable. The stones are so shiny, and catch the light beautifully. I chose the rose gold, which I have been very happy with as it is a little different and feels slightly more feminine than gold or silver. The quality paired with the price of these earrings have earned SamiJewels a return customer."
"Shipped super fast and earrings absolutely sparkle. Didn't love the proportions of these climbers, as they feel a bit small especially when the first jewel of the climber is so large."
"Fast shipping and super pretty. My husband couldn‚Äôt believe the price, still doesn‚Äôt believe me that they were so inexpensive! Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
I have purchased from SamiJewels several times in the past since 2019 and the quality continues to be excellent. These ear climbers are no exception. They are actually comfortable and I get compliments every time I wear them! Thanks Sami!
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person! I love it!
It fits and their so pretty I love them
"Shipping was pretty fast which is why I am rating so high; however, I‚Äôm not so sure about the quality. The backing or the part that goes through the ear hole (rode) bent so easily. I had to bend it back straight. Which made it feel weak and breakable if I am not careful with putting the backing on. Kinda disappoint. The design overall is nice. It might also be my ears but the backing that hangs low and shows the design is a lot shorter and only peaks out below my ear lobes. Again, my piercing can be higher up than normal. But wish it was longer. Again, rating this a 3.5"
My wife absolutely loves these. They are like two sets of earrings. The backs are perfect. Shipping was great. She makes them look stunning
just perfect!love it!
Beautiful and high quality! They are also very unique! In love with my purchase!
Oh! These earrings are so pretty!!! And they match beautifully with my sapphire engagement ring. Thank you so much! Can't wait to wear them at my wedding!
It shipped before the approximated date and I love them! I love the container in which it came in and the directions or tips on caring for my earrings! I'll be sure to take care of them and I can always buy more but great quality and service. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
These earrings are so nice i just ordered 2 more pairs from this seller. My daughter even commented on them. She said i should buy more of them. Lol
Lovely!!! Beyond my expectation.. Thank you!!!
Quedan muy bonitos! They are very beatiful and are exactly as they look in the pic.
I like this earring. The packaging is perfect and the earrings are beautiful. Thanks Arajera
Gorgeous earring! I love wearing the stars in my hair.
Love these earrings!
Wonderful earrings! Very beautiful and lovely. The shipping was formidable! I'm sure that I will buy another pair of earrings soon. :-)
These are such neat ear pins! Well made as always and super cute!
This was shipped on-time and they fit beautifully! I wear them almost every day--they're light and comfortable and super cute.
"Love, love, love these ear cuffs. Shipping was much faster than expected and they were packaged wonderfully."
Very pretty to look at. My third pair of ear climbers from this shop. They don't disappoint :)
"Really delicate and pretty, love them. Beautifully packaged also in little glass bottles. Am Saving up. For more!"
These are so unique and different! I love them!
Love these earrings they are so comfortable and easy to wear. Thank You

LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I will be back!
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
"Very dainty and fit perfectly on my ear - it was a little difficult to put on at first, but that being said, it made it very secure and I have worn this in the shower and while sleeping. I sleep on my side and therefore this is very comfortable. Super cute as well! Note that if you have very small lobes, the zig zag will look larger on the lobe than in the picture."
"LOVE these earrings SO much! They are so unique and beautiful. I was worried they'd twist and fall down to be hanging, but they don't at all!! They stay perfectly in place and are comfortable. So happy with this purchase!"
"I love these earrings! Cute, simple, and no worrying about a backing since each earring is all one piece. I have worn these many times already and would highly recommend! Also, I have sensitive skin and have had zero issues with these!"
"La photo ne rend pas la beaut√© r√©elle de ces petites boucles d'oreilles, elle sont ravissantes, je suis tr√®s satisfaite, vraiment."

Shipping took a bit but that‚Äôs understandable as it‚Äôs far away! I loved the earrings! They stay put and they are so cute!! So many compliments!
I received this from the seller and it was packed beautifully. I love this set. It is so versatile to wear in any combination that you like. Delicate and subtle creating a special vibe. I also got this in the silver finish!
I love them!!! They are gorgeous!
"These ear climbers are adorable! Takes a little time to figure out how to get them in your ear and situated correctly, but once they are in they seem to hold well and look great. I have very small ears and didn't want something too large and these are the perfect size. Also, the items came so nicely packaged in their own boxes and with jewelry cleaning cloths. Always a really nice touch, would definitely buy from this shop again!"

"What an amazing ring! Even more beautiful than the picture. Very special and different design. Also bought the matching earrings. Looks great together. Ring was packed in a little box. Package was sent very quickly, and arrived in a few days. Great service! Thanks."

"Hab schon das 2. mal bestellt , super tolle Ohrringe, sehr schnelle Lieferung , bin rundum zufrieden, kann ich nur empfehlen."
I just love these!! Buying more in different sizes and colors! Fast shipping too! Thank you so much!
"Very cool design, exactly as it looks on the photo. Shipping took as written on the page and the communication with the seller went smoothly. Would recommend and will shop here again."
"So very pretty, and fast shipping!"
Just got mine yesterday and I love them. They're truly beautiful and I love the packaging. They came in a small bottle with corkscrew. Super cute detail that adds to the whole experience. Will buy from here again
Love the way these ear pins look on!! The only negative is they slip down from the curve of my ear from time to time.
"I wore these for the first time yesterday, and got so many compliments on them! They are super comfortable, and pretty and edgy at the same time. Thanks for a lovely item!"
i like it very much Silvana
"They look gorgeous! Small enough to use for work, yet edgy enough to go out. Love ‚Äòem! Bought them in two different tones."
I am absolutely IN LOVE with these earrings. Definitely a new favorite shop!
"SO CUTE. Do not bend the backs roughly! That should be common sense, I suppose. But they are precious. They do tarnish though, so no good at all for regular wear :("
"I wanted something a little bit different than just a simple stud‚Äîthese are so cute! They look just like the picture, and shipped and arrived quickly!"
"envoi parfait, qualit√©, emballage et envoi efficace"

She was reasonable with her price and they came from France..which was ..ooh lala..they were delivered fast ans are wrapped in a bag witha lollipop..how neat! Merci!
"I love this so much, there absolutely beautiful and their exactly what I thought they would be. I have never had the style of earring before so I didn't really know how to put them on, But now that I have them on I am in love!!thank you Tiff and Micah"
Out-by-God-stounding. Love these earrings. Get the 7 stones. They curve EXACTLY how they're supposed to on my ears. Have no doubt they will be my every day earrings. Will be ordering from this shop again. Stones are super iridescent. Worth the wait.
"Completely obsessed! I've received so many compliments and I can barely feel them in my ear. I typically can't wear earrings for more than a few hours, but I've worn these all day and absolutely love them!"
Just received my earrings and was super impressed with the packaging- very sleek and tastefully designed. The earrings are beautifully made and are the perfect size. Immediately I can see the quality in these and it‚Äôs great. I really appreciate the little care card too.
"Absolutely love! I bought these for work, I work outside and with animals, so I wanted a post style earring that was fun and durable (I know, a real sexy way to select an earring, lol!). These are perfect and just what I was looking for. I get lots of compliments and so far they have stood up to my work environment. I highly recommend to treat-yo-self and get a pair of these or any from this store."
Hands down one of my best experiences on etsy ever. Yaeli is an incredibly kind shop owner who was so quick to answer all of my questions AND send me earrings that weren't even on her page yet. The pomegranate spiral earrings are everything I wanted and I wear them everyday <3 thank you so much again Yaeli! Your craft is stunning
"The quality of the necklace is amazing! It is so beautiful. And the packing is absolutely gorgeous as well! The shipping took longer than expected (19 days from when I placed the order) but regardless, I am very happy with this necklace!"
"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus"
Such a gorgeous pair of earrings! LOVE the nature inspired design with seeds. So delightful and unique. Will be back for more from this shop! üòä
"Tr√®s belles boucles oreilles , livraison rapide et soign√©e"
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
"Malgr√© une petite p√©rip√©tie de transport (une boule d'oreille √©tait cass√©e), le service √©tait tout √† fait au rendez-vous avec l'envoi d'une boucle de remplacement dans la foul√©e. Elles sont tr√®s jolie et semblent de belle facture. Merci"
"Love it!!! They came faster than I thought, are of excellent quality, and now if only my ear holes hadn't closed up lol."
"the sterling silver was not as refined as expected but still good for a handmade item. love its design, it makes me look like im wearing 3 piercings. shipping was fast. just had trouble with the local postal system in uae. i recommend wearing the left one on the right ear and vice versa so you dont need to constantly fix it"
Love them! Very good quality!
Very beautiful! Thank you very much!
My second pair of earrings from you. They are lovely! The colour turned out perfect. Thank you!
Love these earrings like the hammered finish lovely colour to
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
"Easy shipping, fast transaction. Best part is earring is so delicate and lovely. Comfortable and elegant. Light enough to mold to ear and not be in the way when I exercise (High Intensity Interval Training). I lost one side once but found it again and ever since wear it with a silicone back and have not had issues since."
Son muy bonitos y de tama√±o perfecto.Elegantes y originales. Adem√°s comet√≠ un error con la direcci√≥n y fui atendida amablemente y sin demora para corregirlo. Gracias :)
"I like how you can choose the size of the ear climber. Love the Gold! So comfortable, forget they are in my ears. Would be helpful to include a little ""how to wear"" in the box though."
"I love these ear climbers! I've worn them everyday since they arrived. The fit and shape work perfectly for my ear. The design is subtle, beautifully, and impressive when noticed. I highly recommend these ear climbers :)"
"Super cute, nicely packaged! The seller was also very courteous."
Thank you very much. Very beautiful‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)"
"I have ordered a pair of ear climbers from this artist before, was only ordering for the left ear this time to mismatch with the moonstone studs I also ordered, but Ara sent me both left and right climbers... so sweet! These climbers are fabulous and with a little bit of practice they become easy to put on. Beautifully made."
Super cute
Love these! Great quality.
"Ich liebe diese Ohrringe! Der Versand hat l√§nger gedauert als angegeben, da habe ich den Verk√§ufer angeschrieben und der Kundenservice ist mega! Man bekommt schnell Antworten und er hat ein neuer Paar losgeschickt. Sie sitzen super. Man muss sich ein bisschen an den Sitz und das an die Ohren klemmen gew√∂hnen, aber nach 2 Tagen klappts perfekt üòÑ Ich habe schon viele Komplimente bekommen und man bleibt nicht an den Ohrringen mit der FFP Maske h√§ngen. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Love them! Simple, something I can wear everyday to add a little touch. Especially since Covid, I‚Äôve been wearing absolutely no jewelry/earrings. So I like that I can look nice without being over the top. Definitely want these in the gold."
"Prettier in person, so lovely for a stone that isn't that lovely!!! Great items!!!! A+++"
Gorgeous! Exactly as pictured and came on time. Bought them as a birthday present to myself and they did not disappoint.
For my daughters birthday in August. She loved them!
I love it!! Thank you..
"I took my time writing this review to thoroughly test these earrings. I admit I was disappointed these had the looped pin style attachment as I have not had success with those in the past. They are always too loose or not secure enough and the weight of the earring will cause it to continuously fall throughout the day. These earrings, however, are designed flawlessly where the pin back is curved and follows the contours of your ear and stays perfectly in place. They are both comfortable and fully functional, where you dont have to pinch the metal to your ears to get them to stay up. Also the stones are gorgeous and have a lovely clarity and luxurious, high quality shape. Overall, I absolutely recommend these and I am going to check out more of their jewelry as I am very impressed."
"These are BEAUTIFUL! Aquamarine is so hard to find just right, these are beautiful!! Even the stones are a little different (the middle one is more green), but the set matches and they are GORGEOUS!"
Really beautiful stones and very well made. Arrived within a month as expected. Highly recommended!
Love these unique ear pins.....thank you!!
Me lleg√≥ ayer y me ha encantado. La sujecion de las tres piezas es mas segura de lo que imaginaba. Sencillos y muy finos :).
"the long earrings are great, though it has taken my ears a few weeks to adjust to them, likely because I put them in my second holes. The cuffs fall off very early. As I result I lost one within the first week. I will be surprised of the i still have the second cuff in another week or so as it falls out easily no matter how tight I make it. They do look great and i get so many compliments."
Absolutely love!
"I love the delicacy of this set. I was worried that the climbers would ""slide"" out of their position, but they don't. I may have to adjust the crisscross cuff a bit to fit my ear better, but that's a small fix. Thank you for my new earcandy!"
"I love these earrings! I had never seen this style of earring before. They are so cool and pretty the way they go up my earlobes. Looks almost like I have multiple piercings. It was a little tricky putting them on the first time, but easier with practice. I also loved that the earrings came packaged in a cute little corked glass bottle for storing them in so they won't tarnish easily. Seller responded quickly to my questions, and the shipment got here pretty quickly considering they came from the Philippines. I will buy from this artist again."
"I love these, they look so beautiful and they fit nicely! It took a bit for me to get them on since my piercing is a bit wonky - but that is just a me thing. They did take longer than expected, but that was of no fault of the seller as she got them out by their expected time."
Received my order and they are everything I wanted. Love them so much!
I love these! They are so cute! exactly what I expected and they shipped on time.

Love thank You üôè
"Worth the wait! I can see myself wearing these every day. Very simple, yet chic. Thank you so much!"
"LOVE! This climber is exactly what I was looking for -- delicate to look at, but sturdy enough that when I put it in I know it will stay in place. Will definitely order more from this store. Also appreciate the fast shipping!"
bellissimi
"it‚Äôs very cool and very interesting, but i realised that the top clip doesn‚Äôt stay very secure on the ear. i had to press really hard till my ears hurt. especially in the winter if you wear a scarf with it, the bottom part will keep hitting the scarf and cause the whole thing to come off on top. love the design tho, would definitely wear it more in the summer!!"
I‚Äôm loving this piece so much! Is beautiful and well made :)
I have just received this beautiful earring (in Italy). Everything has been perfect! I am going to buy again from this amazing shop! Thank you very much!
Sent the wrong ear pin originally... but I was impressed with how quickly they responded and sent me a new one. Will buy again
These are so beautiful! The coloring (the rose gold) is perfect and they are much sturdier and higher quality than i imagined. They don‚Äôt bend like a lot of hoops do and the letters seem like they will stay intact forever. I can‚Äôt wait to wear them.
Perfect! They turned out better then I thought!
"I absolutely love my personalized shoe buckles, they definitely exceeded my expectations. I will be ordering more soon."
Just received these and they are beautiful. A quality job done. Just a heads up: Took two months to receive.
"Very beautiful elegant sophisticated modern earrings. They are light weight with a thicker diameter for the hoop post. If you wear small thin posts normally, I recommend wearing heavier earrings for a while before inserting these, to stretch the piercings out a bit for a more comfortable fit when wearing them."
"This piece is my new favorite! Simple and elegant, it has subtle power to tie the outfit together. It dresses up my casual style and garners compliments nearly every time I wear it. Can't wait to get my hands on a classic mala!"
Bought as Stocking stuffers for my girls. Beautiful!!! Wanted to keep for myself but sadly I was a good Mommy and gave them to the girls.
I LOVE my necklace and get a ton of compliments on it. Amanda was very responsive and I couldn't believe how quickly I received it. I highly recommend the addition of the mint tassel!
"If you're looking for a pair of unique, well-crafted, and unique hoops, look no further! These are perfect for everyday (and night) wear, and I also love that they clearly stand out in comparison with mass-manufactured earrings. The seller was really lovely and accommodating, and it's obvious that she does everything with love. Thank you!"
I love these earrings so much! I got the silver large and medium triangles and they‚Äôre exactly what I was looking for. Even with COVID happening the shipment and delivery was pretty quick.
"Finally found my dream hoops! Perfect size and shape for everyday but also special occasions. High quality material, so definitely worth the price. Thank you <3"
Not only did I receive my package faster than I expected but my ring is gorgeous. The fit is perfect and the quality exceeds my expectations! (it‚Äôs the pinky ring)

"Very pretty earring, shipping took longer then expected but worth the wait."
Absolutely gorgeous and so unique! Be prepared as they did take about six weeks to do you delivered.That was truly my only concern
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)"
"I adore these earrings!!! They are officially my favorite earrings. They are more comfortable than I originally thought they would be. The shipping was fast. Also, the packaging is adorable. The little glass vials they come in are super cute!"
The pins are absolutely adorable! It does take a little bit to get to the US from Singapore - but they are worth the wait!!
LOVE these earrings and can't wait to buy more from her as since I have been wearing them So many people at work stop and ask me about them and say how Pretty they are and where did I get them which of course I tell them! Can't wait to get another pair!!!! Ty for these Beautiful earrings!!!!
Wundersch√∂n!
Love love love! Got so many compliments the first day I wore. I wish I had more money so I could buy them all.
"The first pair I received was missing most of the lines on the rainbows. The seller was very nice and agreed to send another pair. Unfortunately the replacement pair wasn't much better. They're still cute for the price, but the quality isn't great. The shape outlines are nice, but you might want to avoid designs with imprinted patterns."
"Adorable on! Love the little bottle they came in, great idea! Great seller all around A+!!!"
"Did not fit my ears so well. Slippery and wont stay in place. They are beautiful tho, wish I could have them on.."
Absolutely perfect! Totally surprised my daughter with this set on Valentine's day. Super quick service and totally suits my daughter's funky style. A++++ quality and service!
"These ear cuffs are amazing and have worked out well! I wasn't sure if they would stay on, but I wear them at the top of my ear like in the picture and they fit snuggly and comfortably. I've worn them a fair amount and haven't had an issue with them sliding around or falling off. Can be worn on either ear. Super cute! Thank you"
I absolutely love this set and want to wear these all the time! Genuine and just what I expected! Great product!
Fits Perfect and it is so cute. I get compliments all the time. I already ordered more!!

"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"

"Panagiotis is a skilled artisan and a wonderfully responsive seller. I had a question about the silver used in these earrings and he replied within the hour. I love that these are basically a two-in-one sort of deal - they can be worn as a stud for easy daily use, or with the jacket for a more stand-out look. And the titanium is not irritating at all. I couldn't be more pleased! Thank you very much!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
"I have been looking for this style for a while, I was so happy to found them. They are really beautiful on!"
"Love these so much! I‚Äôve had them on since I got them last month and the quality is great, no ear or earring tarnish and just sparkly and beautiful. Shipping was good, it took around a month to deliver but that because it was being delivered from Spain and I am in California, so wait time was expected. Very happy with this purchase and would purchase again üíñ"
"I was so excited to get these! As soon as my tracking app said it was delivered, I raced to the mailbox and ripped the package open! These earrings are GORGEOUS!! I love them so much and they look so good in my piercings. I want to wear these and the other earring purchase from Trium at the same time if I could haha! But I only have to piercing holes, so I‚Äôll have to alternate. Crisan was very kind and understanding about the shipping issues, which wasn‚Äôt his fault of course, during this pandemic."
Obsessed
Feathers mean a lot to me personally so they are just so STUNNING!!!! They are the perfect size. Absolutely in love!!! These are by far the most beautiful ever! I love ear climber type earrings they are so unique. These are so pretty and I am just so happy about how they turned out. I cannot thank you enough for these gorgeous earrings. You have a such a beautiful talent and gift! I cannot wait to buy more. You are such an amazing seller! Thank you! I will post pictures later!1
"These silver leaf ear climbers are some of the cutest earrings I have ever seen. They are small and dainty, but seem to be good quality. I love them! They are something that you can wear all the time, dressy or casual. They also are earrings you can sleep in that won‚Äôt poke you behind your ear. Fabulous! I‚Äôm so excited about them. They came so quickly too. I would be happy to order from this shop again. Thanks so much!!"
Very cute and sweet little earrings for any occasion. I've received many compliments on them already. I love them. The shop was great and I received the earrings within a few days. Very quick response and send off. Will definitely check out more from this shop.
Love them!
These ear cuffs are beautiful and elegant! Very well made! They look very nice on the ear. Very comfortable to wear. Shipping was very quick. Would definitely buy from this seller again! They came in a very nice little bag made of soft material. Very pleased with purchase! Thank you for making these ear cuffs!
Beautiful! Worth every penny I love them!
So pretty and intricate. Arrived very quickly and wore them the next day.
Love the earrings! Wore them on my birthday today!
"Love these bar earrings! I got them in several colors. great quality, even better price! =)"
"Got them today, super-do, love them! they are very long. I might have gone with smaller ones, but I do love them."
LOVE them! I got all the women in my wedding party these earrings (and also got myself a pair!!). Very reasonably priced and beautiful.
Cute. A little longer than expected but I still like them :)
Absolute beautiful
My mom loves them. Now her and I both have a pair of lovely ear pins. :) Thanks so much!
"These ear pins are beautiful, I love them!!"
Love these! Thank you :)
"While the shipping took a while, the seller lets you know several times so you know what you're getting into. But the wait is worth it! These earrings are so beautiful and were exactly what I was looking for."
Absolutely stunning!! Really high quality materials and definitely a lot sturdier than any ear climbers I've bought before. Will definitely be buying loads more colours!
I absolutely love this seller. So sweet and her handiwork is stunning. Would definitely tell others about her shop!
"Absolutely in love with my earrings, thank-you so much!!!"
I love it! Thank you! Delivery will take some time but everything arrived intact in a cute tiny glass jar. My second order and its a gorgeous buy!
These are beautiful earrings. This is my 3rd pair of earrings from this vendor and they do excellent work. Highly recommend.
Wonderful! Looks fantastic on. Shipping takes about 4 weeks just like she says.
"The item is great but it took ages to get to me, however, I am very pleased with it, beautifully packaged, Thankyou"

Super fast shipping and great prices. The earrings are beautiful. I had ordered one pair previously and got so many compliments I had to get more.
I love these! They are the perfect minimalistic look!
Amazingly fast shipping and exactly as pictured! Definitely will be buying more from you!!! Thanks!

The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
These ear crawlers are so beautiful and really comfortable! I like them so much I ordered more pairs in different colors! Communication was great and shipping was fast. They also were packaged nicely. I can't say enough good things!
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
Merci et bravo. Tr√®s satisfaite du joli travail que vous avez r√©alis√© √† partir des graines du flamboyant. A bient√¥t pour d'autres commandes.
Such a gorgeous pair of earrings! LOVE the nature inspired design with seeds. So delightful and unique. Will be back for more from this shop! üòä
"Merci pour ces tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles, offertes √† ma fille pour No√´l. Elle les appr√©cie beaucoup !"
These are so cool! I love them! Receive many compliments when I wear them! They got to me super fast even coming from Israel! very easy to put in and they stay!

"Gli orecchini sono di ottima fattura, mi piacciono molto!"

superbes boucles d'oreilles correspondent aux photos
They are absolutely beautiful! I will definitely purchase from this seller again.
I love the earrings. They are really beautiful and I plan on using them for daily wear
"I love them!! As I looked at my options, the shop was great with helping me decide if I should do something custom, or purchase these. I was looking for a dainty pair of diamond earrings, but didn‚Äôt want solitaire studs. I love Art Deco style jewelry, and the baguette diamonds on these studs give me that vibe. They are absolutely perfect, and the mixed metals of white gold & yellow gold on my ear look awesome. Thank you!"
"I absolutely adored this earrings. They look even better in person, as the variation of colors make the yellow sapphires really pop out. They are very dainty and elegant, yet sexy and so unique at the same time. I liked these so much that I ended up getting a second pair in Rose Gold with Ruby eyes!"
"Beautiful! The delivery took longer than expected but not by much, especially given that it‚Äôs COVID times. Great quality and look better that in pictures. I‚Äôve already worn them multiple times. Thank you!"
Super pretty! Picture doesn‚Äôt do just to how stunning these are
Elegant and sparkly! Adds instant subtle attraction and is not too over the top. I love the jacket type and this is the first of many!
My earrings arrived very quickly and in good condition. I absolutely love these earrings - so pretty and sparkly. The quality is great and they are now my new favorite earrings!
"I am in love with this climbers :) they‚Äôre so beautiful, well made and delicate‚Äîthank you so much!"
First time trying these types of earrings and I like them a lot. Very creative and cute. Thank you!
Perfect holiday gift. Almost too hard to give away!
"Got these for a gift for my mum for her birthday. She absolutely loved them! Ara was very professional and helpful when I had made contact, sell beautiful stuff on her page. Will definitely be a returning customer thank you!"
I love them! They sit beautifully on the ears.
"I love these earrings, my ears aren't the right shape for ear climbers but I've been wearing them as a hanging pair of earrings for the last two weeks and I love them. So many compliments."
"I‚Äôm very pleased with these ear climbers. I did not realize how far away the seller was, but I received them as promptly as could be."
"These earrings are so pretty! They are slightly too big for my abnormally small ears, so the tip of the leaves sometimes digs into the top of my earlobes a bit, but they still fit and look great, and don't come off unintentionally. Bought them in bronze to match the mini ring in the same finish also from this shop-- perfect combo."
"My absolute favorite everyday earrings. This is my third pair in bronze (I have a terrible habit of losing things). I will continue to buy a new pair every time I drop one down the drain or vacuum one up. I love the feel of the pins rather than posts. So many compliments. Adorable, unique, and I feel incomplete without them. Buy em. For real."
"Beautiful set! I wish I'd purchased multiples, in different colours. I bought the gold colour which is a little off-gold, doesn't pass for real gold. But that wasn't my plan, just a heads up I'd recommend being adventurous with the colour! Arrived super fast, too!"
"I adore these ear climbers, will be ordering more very soon. Thank you, I love them!"
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!

"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"
"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ma commande qui est arriv√©e dans un temps record ! De plus, Marjolaine est vraiment tr√®s gentille, elle avait joint un petit cadeau en plus, et l'article command√© √©tait emball√© √† la perfection.

Un seul mot : parfait !! Au del√† de mes esp√©rances je devais recevoir ce cadeau entre le 20 et 23 je l‚Äôai re√ßu le 17 et √ßa a beaucoup plu . Bravo et merci üëå

I love the earrings! Excellent craftsmanship and service

The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
This shop is top shelf. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love my earring jackets and I look forward to getting more Thank you Carl you are awesome üëèüèªüòÉ
"Superbe boucles, je suis ravie de cet achat ! Je recommande :)"
Tr√®s jolie ! De tr√®s jolies couleurs pour l'automne. Beau travail !
So I had a tiny little diamond stud that was almost too small to even wear. These jackets made them my favorite earrings! My husband got me the diamonds and they have been in a drawer for years. Now they are my favorites. Just adorable!
"Well made, solid, thick, and useful with a couple of pairs of studs that needed a little something extra. Very artful look. Fun packaging as well."
"Very happy! I have been looking for almost a year for a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù that would allow me to wear pearls I inherited from my Grandmother. I have stretched lobes and wouldn‚Äôt change that, but do want to wear this pair of earrings on occasion. These jackets allow me get a good fit that won‚Äôt slip through. I bought a couple sizes and colors to mix up and pair on the front and back of my lobe to secure the pearl. So excited it works and will probably order more. Beautiful and functional!"
I love these! They are beautiful and I can't wait to wear them for my wedding! Shipping was on time and even sooner than I expected! And I love that I got two extra clasps.
Absolutely gorgeous! Really love them!
Insanely gorgeous. Such great quality
in love with these climbing earrings! fast delivery too!
"I love this cuff! It‚Äôs beautifully made, the packaging is amazing and it came very quickly. Thank you!"
"richtig wundersch√∂ner Schmuck! Die Ohrklemmen sind sehr bequem zu tragen und toll gearbeitet und die Haarspange ist ein Traum! Habe sie eigentlich zum verschenken gekauft, werde sie aber vielleicht behalten oder einfach gleich noch eine bestellen..."
"Ich bin wirklich begeistert. Die Qualit√§t wirkt sehr hochwertig. Das Tragen der Klammer ist angenehm. Man merkt sie √ºberhaupt nicht. Ich hatte tats√§chlich diesbez√ºglich bedenken aber diese sind √ºberhaupt nicht eingetroffen. Danke! Auch daf√ºr, dass ihr das P√§ckchen mit so viel liebe verpackt habt"
"An sich sehr sch√∂ner Cliff und super schneller Versand! Hatte ihn den ersten Tag zuhause getestet, da sa√ü er gut und ist gef√ºhlt nicht verrutscht, daher den Tag darauf ""drau√üen"" abgehabt. Leider habe ich ihn dabei wohl sogleich verloren ohne es zu merken. Ich bin nirgends h√§ngen geblieben oder √§hnliches, das hei√üt er muss wohl recht locker gewesen sein oder wie kann ich mir das sonst erkl√§ren... Schade, ich hatte mich schon gefreut, ihn oft zu tragen, aber so traue ich mich nicht, nochmal zu bestellen, wenn die Freude dann nur so kurz ist, auch wenn ich es nat√ºrlich irgendwie selbst verschuldet haben muss."
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
The seller was very prompt at shipping. Let me tell you the ear cuffs are gorgeous and I would definitely recommend this shop for anyone. I was very skeptical as to how a simple lobe clip will hold entire cuffs weight onto ear. I had lot of problems keeping ear cuffs in position. These cuffs are light in weight and clip on lobe holds everything in place. Love it

She was reasonable with her price and they came from France..which was ..ooh lala..they were delivered fast ans are wrapped in a bag witha lollipop..how neat! Merci!
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
I had to switch these out for a different pair only because my ears are a bit smaller than average and it didn't sit right. Ilona to the rescue! She was so accommodating and allowed me to seamlessly exchange for a pair that perfectly compliment my headpiece and dress. Thank you soooo much!
"This ear climber is truly brilliant; the sparkle is superlative! Quality is sturdy, and it stays in place for hours without leaving my ear feeling sore as other cartilage clips and magnets have done. Shipping was fast and the earrings were spotless and nicely packaged; I'm so looking forward to wearing this climber to several upcoming occasions! Thank you Iloniti!"

Tr√®s jolie ! De tr√®s jolies couleurs pour l'automne. Beau travail !
I love my silver choker. I am able to wear it longer or shorter. I have gotten many compliments on it. It arrived quickly and the vendor also included an adjustable silver ring at no cost as well. I will definitely buy from this vendor again.
These are the perfect lightweight earrings! They have a nice shine and are so light I almost don‚Äôt even notice I am wearing them. Love them as a memorial piece for the dog I recently lost.
I am obsessed with this ring! It's the perfect thing to fidget with in meetings and is a stunning piece of jewelry too! I am very happy with my purchase and will buy again from this seller
The earrings came quickly and were fastened in a cute button in a gift box. These were a gift for my mom's bday/ Easter and they exceeded my expectations. Super shiny and lovely and just the right size.
"I love these earrings! They come just as pictured, and feel weightless. It's easy to forget you're wearing them because of how comfortable they are. Totally great!!"
Adorable! So happy with it.
Very nice item! Good Seller!!
not exactly what I expected
"I bought these for 9 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves them! She loves how they look like she has a second piercing and how they twinkle on her ears. I‚Äôm a huge fan as well, absolutely adorable on her :) this is her first pair of ear climbers and now not her last. Well made and exactly as described. Thank you!"
"Literally have gotten five climber earrings from this shop in the past few weeks. I‚Äôm in complete love. Amazing quality and work, fast shipping too. Thank you so much!!!"
I'm from the US and met a girl from Canada a few months back. We have Zoom dates once a week and for Valentine's Day I wanted to get her something that had to do with her favorite flower. She absolutely loved them ‚ù§
"Love, love, loooove these earrings!!! I ordered the babies breath ear climbers-they‚Äôre perfect!! I didn‚Äôt want just plain climbers & i didn‚Äôt want a fancy pair full of diamonds....these are the perfect in between I‚Äôve been looking for!! Easy ordering & fast shipment, too."
"Ma paire de boucles d'oreilles pr√©f√©r√©e!!! Je les porte tout le temps. L'envoi √©tait soign√©, merci beaucoup."
Tr√®s joli porte cl√© fait avec soin et rapidement. Harmonie des couleurs : Top! Justine la cr√©atrice est tr√®s appliqu√©e et attentive! Merci pour cet envoi arriv√© √† temps pour le cadeau de fin d‚Äôann√©e scolaire.
Les boucles d'oreilles sont extr√™mement jolies et sont arriv√©es rapidement et bien emball√©es. Je ne doute pas qu'elles plairont √† la personne qui les recevront en cadeau (en tout cas si elles ne lui plaisent pas je lui reprends sans probl√®me XD). Merci beaucoup !
Ce bracelet est tr√®s joli! Les couleurs sont superbes et le port√© est top! J‚Äôadore! Merci Justine pour la qualit√© de votre travail et votre disponibilit√© (r√©ponses tr√®s rapides Et l‚Äôenvoi aussi!). Je reviendrai pour de prochaines commandes avec plaisir!

Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
Love them!
These earrings are amazing. They are unique and stylish. I get many compliments when I wear them. I have already ordered more jewelry from this shop.
"So cool and even came with a little extra pair of cute earrings! love them, well worth the wait. xx"
"Great earring, I got these for a friend to match her 80s look. Thanks."
Really top!!!! I love them !
Goes great with everyday outfits!
Great earrings. I love them.
"Maeva is incredible! I asked her to customize this necklace for me, and she gave me exactly what I had hoped for. The necklace is gorgeous. High quality workmanship. AMAZING!!!"
Les boucles d'oreille sont magnifiques ! Emball√©es avec soin. Je recommande üëç
Bijoux de tr√®s bonne qualit√© et tr√®s tr√®s jolis. Je recommande !!!
Gioielli bellissimi! Gli ho provato insieme al abito da sposa e sono di un eleganza unica!
"Unfortunately , have not yet rec'd the product, but I'll have to check with my wedding purchases, as the wedding will not take place until mid September. Thank you for checking in with me. I LOVE Etsy!!!!"
Very fun to wear and no one else has them!
They are cute but one is backwards when you put it on.
"Love the earrings, small and comfortable. :)"
Fabulous earrings!
"beautiful, dainty, elegant, girly, funky!!! I'm glad I went for the 2 piece. can mixed matched with other earrings, great quality üëå"
I was looking for a tiny bird earring when I saw this one. It is truly tiny! The twig is also tiny. I was afraid of losing them but the seller added an additional plastic back up for the earrings and I think those will keep them safe. They are very small but adorable. Just be aware of what you‚Äôre ordering.
"Love these earrings! FYI to future buyers, these earrings are 3 pieces, not 2. You have the front and back like a regular earring but the jacket is a separate piece that you have to put on individually and then put the back on top of it. I struggled slightly to get them on, but once I did, I love them and wear them everyday!"
"Really pretty! They were a bit too long for me, so they didn't look as delicate as in the pictures. But I have small earlobes, so that's on me. Great quality and fast shipping!"
These earrings are gorgeous. They do hang slightly lower than I thought from the picture but overall aesthetic is the same. I'd highly recommend.
"These are my new go-to earrings this summer. Very, very pretty and comfortable. Look quite nice on my ears. Very happy with this purchase!"
"Wow! Your bold, unique bracelet is an amazing piece! I LOVE it! A rugged artisan look that's tempered with just enough elegance to be feminine. And your listing description didn't mention the clever extension that ends in a tiny brass triangle, but what a brilliant touch! The counter-weight keeps the main triangle on TOP of your wrist instead of dangling below where you can't see it, and it feels delightfully sensuous as it brushes against your wrist. This is the first ""single decoration"" bracelet I haven't had to ADD a counter-weight to. Why don't other artists think of this detail? So glad you did! Thanks! Dalene"
"Gorgeous! These are stunning, and I have received many a compliment on them - so I pass it on! Plus, the shipping was really fast, a plus when you are waiting for such treasures. Thanks!"
Super unique and 100% gorgeous-I‚Äôm a happy girl!! Thanks Bunnycone Designs‚ù§Ô∏è
Gorgeous oxidized sterling silver earrings from an amazing artist and silversmith who sent them to me in record time; the earrings are even more beautiful than the photos (and the photos were great!). Thank you so much!
"These are beautiful - so much better in person than in the pictures. Sturdy, practical, relief style so condensation has a place to go... I have them distributed throughout my apartment so wherever I want to set down a beverage there‚Äôs a great statement coaster to put it on & protect my furniture. I had been looking for something a bit cheaper but I‚Äôm so so so glad I got these. They‚Äôre going to last forever and they absolutely add to my decor. They arrived quickly, wrapped in soo much protective stuff. I‚Äôm really happy with my purchase."
My order arrived quickly and well packaged. Lexi was wonderful to work with. These earrings are spectacular. Their condition is amazing. They have so much sparkle and are really beautiful. I love them.
"I ordered these 2 days ago and they‚Äôre already here! Incredibly fast shipping, and these coasters are exactly as pictured! Absolutely beautiful. The packaging was very thoughtful, all coasters were individually wrapped and even came with a handwritten note from the seller! Very impressed and will be buying from here again."
"Exactly as pictured, and even more beautiful in person than in the photos. The coasters have a nice weight to them so they won't blow away on my patio, and have cork on the underside so they don't scratch tabletops. I appreciate the thoughtful handwritten note and free cards. Thank you!"
"Super c'est conforme √† la photo , d√©lai de livraison respect√© et puis je suis tr√®s satisfaite de mon choix."
Exquisite piece of beading. It used very small beads and is a lovely piece of jewellery.
jolies boucles d' oreilles pas trop grandes. merci beaucoup
Boucles d'oreilles tr√®s jolies. Satisfaite de mon achat.
Such a gorgeous pair of earrings! LOVE the nature inspired design with seeds. So delightful and unique. Will be back for more from this shop! üòä
superbes boucles d'oreilles correspondent aux photos
Deuxi√®me achat et toujours aussi satisfaite. Merci pour votre travail. Belles cr√©ations avec tout ce que la nature nous offre mais h√©las nous passons souvent √† c√¥t√© sans nous en rendre compte.
"Malgr√© une petite p√©rip√©tie de transport (une boule d'oreille √©tait cass√©e), le service √©tait tout √† fait au rendez-vous avec l'envoi d'une boucle de remplacement dans la foul√©e. Elles sont tr√®s jolie et semblent de belle facture. Merci"
"Beautiful and unusual ear climber earring, comfortable to wear. Sits nicely in the ear, very striking piece."
"I love my ear cuff and many people have commented on it! In fact I love it so much that after losing it ( my fault totally) I bought another one because I missed it! It's very comfortable to wear, slips on easily and remains firmly in place. I would highly recommend it!"
"Stunning earrings! Absolutely love them. Very thoughtful to include instructions on how to put them in, as that first time is a bit like a puzzle. Fast delivery to. Would definitely recommend."
"The cuff is so nicely made and comfortable to wear - I can't feel it at all. I previously had a double helix piercing that didn't heal well and I ended up taking them out, so I'm really happy to have an alternative. It looks great and the helpful instructions were very useful. Thanks so much!"
"Ear cuff bellissimi e colorati, spedizione veloce, acquister√≤ di nuovo sicuramente ü•∞"
"I purchased the snake tragus cuff, 2 star cuffs, and a necklace and I'm very happy with each item. The Tragus is comfortable & fits securely. I found that the Star cuff is slightly bendable so you can adjust it to preference and wear it higher/lower along your ear. Based on price, the good quality and the timely manner it arrived, I would definitely buy from this shop again. Thank you!"
Simplistic yet rich. Very nice quality. The gold tone fits well with my real gold earrings.
Shipped relatively fast! The earrings were not as round as they look in the picture. They are more oval shaped. Other than that I really like mine and almost look like the ones I lost!
"These earrings are lovely the floral stud can be worn individually or with the stem adornment, very versatile. Great shipping and packaging. You won't be disappointed."
"Probably the prettiest pair of earrings i have, they look even better than the photo! Arrived on time, carefully wrapped! I am very satisfied with this purchase, would definately buy again!"
Luscious in color and style! I can wear in several ways so I can wear everyday if I'd like. And I am thinking that I'll do just that!! Thank you for sharing your great talent with all of us! You are easy to LOVE!!!
"These are fantastic earrings! Well made, even prettier than pictured and arrived on time. Thank you so much, I love them:-)"
Love these. Get compliments all the time.
"I can't say enough about how well this fits. I arranged with the seller to adjust it to fit my helix. She was very easy to work with and the cuffs fit beautifully! When my next order arrives, I will have 4 of them!"
THIS PAIR OF EARRINGS ARE STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL!! THEY ARE VERY WELL MADE AND DAINTY!! VERY NICE SELLER THAT RESPONDS QUICKLY TO QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE!! THANK YOU! üòçüòçüòç
This is my first cuff. I had it made to fit the helix. It fits snugly and does not hurt my ear after hours of wear. I love it and intend to order others with other beads!
"Minima Maxima came to Renegade Craft in Boston, so I had the opportunity to purchase these stunning earrings in person. They're little art pieces - and incredibly lightweight. I loved them so much that I purchased another pair on Etsy for my cousin. Arrived quickly and beautifully packaged, as well. The owners are down-to-earth and super sweet - support these fine folks!"
"I have these in silver and bought them in gold for a friend. I love the unique art deco design. They look great from the front and back, my favorites! Thanks MinMax peeps :D"
"My granddaughter loves these earrings. They're a little tricky to put on, but she mastered it in no time. A unique. beautiful look. Thank you."
"Die Ohrringe sind ziemlich gro√ü f√ºr meine Ohrl√§ppchen und pieksen dann an meinem Hals. Ich hab vier Wochen auf die Lieferung gewartet und durfte dann noch zus√§tzlich Zollgeb√ºhren bezahlen, weil es offensichtlich nicht richtig deklariert war. 37‚Ç¨ Warenpreis + 14‚Ç¨ Versand + 10‚Ç¨ Zollgeb√ºhren f√ºr ein bissl Acryl mit bissl Goldfarbe. Schade."
I am positively in love with these beauties! üòçüåüüòçüåüüòçüåüüòç
"Item arrived quickly and beautifully packaged. The jacket earrings are awesome-- have gotten so many compliments. Unique, lightweight, LOVE THEM."
i bought the earrings as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and they are perfect!! he loves them and they look insanely cool on. seriously nailed the modern unisex style i would highly recommend to anyone who‚Äôs checking this shop out (-:
I love my new earrings! They got here on a timely manner and safely packed. Will order from them again! Very attentive seller :)
I love these guys soo much!! They‚Äôre so much lighter than I was expecting which is wonderful. The most perfect little unique touch for my ears. Thank you!!
Love them!!! Thank you!
I bought these beautiful earrings for myself and really love them. They are not only gorgeous but also very light and comfortable to wear. 100% happy with them!
Some of the most unique and most complimented earrings I have ever worn.
very cute! upon opening i was nervous the rose gold was a little too flashy but once they were on they looked great!
Beautiful climber (hoops are from another Etsy shop)! They feel great and are just what I'd been wanting. Good quality and fast shipping! Thank you!
Gorgeous! I love them-excellent quality!
These are very cute however difficult to get them to stay on the earlobe. Constantly comes out of place and I have to readjust it. Would have been nice to include a backing piece.
LOVE THEM!!! So dainty and beautiful. Get lots of complements when I wear these :)) the only thing is the jewels that hand down are always facing backwards but u guess you can‚Äôt tell very much
"Beautiful earrings! They are both elegant and delicate looking, my only complaint is that they are a hook-style back and not a post! They slip from the ear fairly easily with the weight of the chain since they aren't secured in the back. But despite that, they are gorgeous earrings and look even more amazing in person."
Absolutely love these earrings I bought one for me and another for a friend and we are so happy with the quality and unique beauty of this piece!
Absolutely perfect. Communication was extremely helpful. Quick delivery. I love these earrings. They are going to go great with the two necklaces I bought from this seller.
"The beads were a little bigger than expected and the posts are extra long. I thought it would be a bit dainty-er (maybe I just have a tiny ear lobe?). Otherwise, great quality and I haven‚Äôt had an issues with sensitivity or reactions to the earrings, which is fairly rare for me. The seller had super quick turnaround and I got these in record time"
Love these! I have a total of 7 earlobe piercings and this is perfect for something a little different. I wear ball studs in all the other piercings.
Thank you!
Love this little earring. Shipped fast. Thank You
"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus"
Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho! I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes.
Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
"I saw this design in an Etsy promotional email, and I knew I had to have it! It's the first earring with a jacket that I had ever seen, and I love how delicate it looks. People say it looks like spikes, but it looks like a star with its beams of light to me. I love it so much. The earrings and the jacket are both well made and sturdy. Despite being based in Spain, they shipped quickly and arrived within a week!"
"These are beautiful earrings that give just enough interest to an outfit. I love wearing them with just regular tees or with casual dresses. I got them in gold and they perfectly complement my boyish pixie cut. Lalia quickly shipped my purchase the day after I ordered them, but because she's based in Spain, it took about a week and a half to get to the U.S. (just to give you a heads up). The earrings are well worth the wait though, I promise!!"
I absolutely love these earrings! I bought them because I had purchased from this Etsy store before and was pleased with the jewelry. I love that these eat jackets have three different holes to adjust the length. They are beautiful!
"C'√©tait parfait, autant la rapidit√©, les jolies colliers fid√®les aux photos avec en plus un cadeau. Ils me vont bien tous les deux je suis tr√®s contente : )"
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles , articles envoy√©s dans les temps."
Joli masque et de bonne qualit√©. Livraison rapide et soign√©e. Merci beaucoup ! üòä
"Tr√®s joli collier. L‚Äôenvoi est arriv√© tr√®s rapidement et en bonne condition, Merci."
"Oh wow! J'ai re√ßue ma commande tr√®s rapidement! Tr√®s bel emballage , mignon et professionnel. Les boucles d'oreilles sont magnifiques. Conformes aux photos sur le site. Elle sont belles et de bonne qualit√©. Je les adore! Je recommande sans h√©siter!!! Merci beaucoup !"
"Ma fille est ravie. Elle les adorent, et super contente d'avoir d√©couvert la petite surprise"
"Love, love, love my Betty Boop earings! The length and size is perfect. I'm a big Betty Boop fan. The price is great."
"Je suis encore ravie de ma commande. Le colis a √©t√© envoy√© tr√®s rapidement. J'adore les boucles d'oreilles et le marque page. Ce n'est pas ma premi√®re commande, ni ma derni√®re."
"I love this ear cuff! It is even better in person. Also, what I didn't realize is that the chained sword can slide along the bottom ring of the cuff which I super appreciate bc then you can place it where you want - I love this feature a lot bc I really prefer things hanging more on the front of my ear than off the side. Seller was so nice to receive and get this order out to me the day before(!) he left on a trip - amazing."
"It was only after I already ordered the ear cuff (see review below), that I saw seller also carried a matching necklace. Seller took the time to rearrange the pricing so both orders could be mailed together and save me shipping costs! I love this necklace as well as a lot of items on this site and would come back. Pricing is very fair which I sure do appreciate. Shipping from France to New York was only 17 days (and that included a couple weekends). Pretty packaging. I also appreciate that seller gives you a variety of choices so you can custom order just how you want it. Great product and great shopping experience - Recommend!"
"Excellent ear cuffs! I got the ""clear"" earcuffs (which in this listing, is white with pink and purple reflections) It was a little unexpected but I'm happy to say Gill offered to exchange them for ""clear white"". He also updated the picture to show the pink purple reflections (the one showing all of the cuff/gemstone options) Even though the color was unexpected, it turned out to be gorgeous and that's why I ended up keeping them. I'm completely happy with my experience. I highly recommend this shop - you won't be disappointed!"
I haven't taken them off since I got them. Birthstone kitties. I think they are simply beautiful.
"Masque cousu avec soin, tr√®s joli et de loin le plus confortable √† porter que j'ai achet√© ( le moins cher √©galement ) !! Merci beaucoup !!"
"Bien re√ßu apr√®s un long d√©lai, ce qui est normal en cette p√©riode particuli√®re. Excellente communication avec la vendeuse qui est tr√®s r√©active. Les finitions manquent toutefois de r√©gularit√©. Les carr√©s d√©maquillant ne font pas tous la m√™me taille et certains ne sont pas parfaitement carr√©s. Malgr√© tout les motifs sont beaux, pas d√©√ßue de ce c√¥t√© l√†. A voir √† l'usage d√©sormais ! Merci et bonne continuation."
S'adapte parfaitement au visage de ma fille de 5 ans. Merci!
"PARFAIT, un grand MERCI pour votre rapidit√©. Masque tr√®s joli, tr√®s satisfaite. Je recommande avec plaisir+++++"
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
This shop is top shelf. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love my earring jackets and I look forward to getting more Thank you Carl you are awesome üëèüèªüòÉ
"J'ai re√ßu mon masque tr√®s rapidement et je suis ravie !!! Il est non seulement magnifique, mais aussi bien enveloppant et confortable. Le travail est soign√© et les finitions sont parfaites. Mille mercis !!"
"Vom Material und von den Farben bin ich total begeistert. Allerdings sind sie doch etwas gro√ü. Wer sich die Beschreibung durchliest, ist echt im Vorteil. Im Sommer werde ich sie aber auf jeden Fall tragen. Sie sind wundersch√∂n."
"The earrings look beautiful. I had assumed they were made with a light cardboard covered in African print. In fact they are quite thick, strong and heavier than most earrings of this design. They are slightly too long for me: the bottom edge touches my shoulders. If you like big, bulk earrings you'll love these because as I say, they are beautiful. They just weren't quite what I was looking for."
J'adore ! Merci beaucoup pour ces masques tr√®s tendance !!!
"It took a month and there were some delivery problems with the US postal service, but they finally arrived. Just as pictured, lovely!"
"I will start with how much i love my earrings! Shiny beautiful diamonds, amazing manufacture and a great closure! Everything was fast considering they came from India. Arround 4 days with UPS. Geeta responded to all my messages and her english is really good! No problems at all during this process! Before i purchased i read all reviews and i was concerned that my earrings will be to tiny and i made the bad choice to ask her if she can make them in 10 mm diameter. Well..they didnt worked good for me as i personaly like my earrings, even huggies.. to sit fit and nice on my ear lobe. She was really nice and understood my issue and in no time i shipped the earrings back and received a new pair with the good size. And again,very fast! All this back and forth process! Nowi am rocking my new #lovegiftpoint earrings! Thank you Geeta"
"I did a custom order and it turned out perfectly! I asked Geeta to turn some of her beautiful jewelry into labrets for my cartilage piercings and swap out some colors of stones and both sets of earrings arrived exactly as I imagined, if not more beautiful. I would give more stars if I could!"
Took a little while to get the earrings but I love them!!!!! Even better than pictured.
Wonderful! Great product and fast delivery! Seller went above and beyond with the personal touch! Will definitely shop from here again!
Received earrings quickly. Can style in different ways for those who have more than one piercing.
Item was great. These earrings are a little heavy to wear.
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."
"Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy! I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently."
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
This is such a unique piece! I wore it for my celestial-themed wedding and got so many nice compliments. A very special addition to my wardrobe on my special day. :)
"Initially awkward to put on, but now I have got the hang of it (I had to refer to the pics). Nevertheless, this was the most accurate Cancer Zodiac Constellation earrings that I found (6 stars, rather than 5). 10/10 for the tracked DHL courier delivery to the UK."
Such great quality earrings! I absolutely love them. They are just a tiny bit too big for my ear shape but I don‚Äôt mind too much. And it didn‚Äôt take too long to get to me.
"It shipped on time, and I love these! They're very pretty, and look good on me. The only problem I had was trying to put them in. Perhaps instructions should come with orders? Nevertheless, these are amazing!"
They are so beautiful!! Thank you so much! I received it very quickly and it was gorgeously packed! Like a little present! üòç Thank you DnDCreationsHawaii!
"The ring I purchased is the silver honu with blue opal. It is dainty and elegant and fits/looks great on my index finger. I wear six rings and my son told me this is his favorite. Shipping was prompt and the seller was gracious, including a lovely quote and mini shells in a cute bag. Thank you."
This ring is just what I was looking for! Being adjustable means I can wear it on any finger. It is so delicate and the detail on the pineapple is so pretty!
Extremely fast shipping and receiving. This ring is beautiful and being able to adjust it to different fingers is amazing.
Very pretty and unique earrings. Didn't realize they would be matte silver rather than shiny but love them anyway and goes with other matte silver I own. Thanks for your wonderful design and craftsmanship
"I love the versatility of this earring design. It's easy to picture wearing these as only studs on both ears, with the stud plus earring jacket on both ears, or a stud on one side and a stud plus an earring jacket on the other side. This look is pure fun. ‚ù§Ô∏è! Marilee"
It took a long time to be delivered but it made in the promised time and the wait was totally worth it. They are well made pieces! Very pretty!
Best earrings. This is not the first time I bought earrings from virginiawynne I love the work and each piece is unique.
"So stunning. I love it!!! *Just noting that in the picture I‚Äôm wearing it on the wrong ear, it‚Äôs supposed to be on the other so that the earring curves down (with the shape of the earlobe) and not up."
"Shipping took a bit longer because of covid and it being international, but totally worth the wait and M√≥nica from their team was very helpful and responsive. Love the piece and the quality, would (and will be) buying from this shop again!"
The earring was cute and dainty. They shipped super fast but it took a while for it to arrive due to covid. Great customer service. Thank you!
LOVE these. Just like the picture - so cute and easy to put on. Definitely will be buying from them again
"This bracelet was a custom design for my maid of honor and it is absolutely perfect! Jennifer was so helpful and worked with me to make it perfect. She went above and beyond to get this just the way I wanted it and even incorporated an engraved charm that I had made by another shop. The bracelet is beautiful in person and I also received a personalized card congratulating me on my wedding :) I would gladly recommend this shop to anyone who is looking for something unique and QUALITY!!!! And, I would definitely purchase from her again. Cost was also great for the quality and the work that was put into this! 1 MILLION STARS. I am not posting a pic simply because I don't want my maid of honor to see it :)"
"These were custom made to match a necklace set that Jennifer made for me. These earrings are the perfect size, beautiful and a great balance between trendy, modern and delicate. These can be worn daily or for a more dressy look. I highly recommend them and all of Jennifer's jewelry."
Love them!!
I got the little bees and they are so dainty and beautiful. I absolutely love them and the fit amazing with another pair I had.
"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"
"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ma commande qui est arriv√©e dans un temps record ! De plus, Marjolaine est vraiment tr√®s gentille, elle avait joint un petit cadeau en plus, et l'article command√© √©tait emball√© √† la perfection. Je recommande vivement cette SUPER Boutique de notre si belle √ÆLE DE BEAUTE !!"
en ce moment je n ai pas de chance avec mes commandes ! je n ai pas re√ßu ce que j ai command√© ! pour ce faire pardonner j ai re√ßu un petit cadeau : petit tr√©s petit .... √ßa m a fait sourire ; mais je ne suis pas fach√©e et cela ne m emp√®che pas de faire mes modestes cr√©ations Merci √† tous sinc√®res sympathie ....

"Excellent always happy to buy the most beautiful coral from Corsica,probably the nicest in the world ,owner is fantastic the best by far."
"Livraison rapide et fiable. Composition r√©ussie, avec de belles pi√®ces de verre et de cuivre. L√©g√®res et mobiles. Une couleur facile √† porter. Contente de mon achat."
Tolle Ohrringe. Haben mir sofort gefallen. Sie sind nicht zu gro√ü und filigran vom Design. Super f√ºr den Sommer. Auch die Patina gef√§llt mir gut.
"Livraison rapide et soign√©e A l'int√©rieur : 2 sachets dor√©s et blancs, l'un √† rayures, l'autre √† pois... Ces boucles d'oreilles sont originales, belles Merci Francesca pour tout cela, ainsi que pour le sachet de diff√©rentes jolies pierres Je commanderai √† nouveau"
"Subtiles et raffin√©es , je les adore! Tr√®s gaies, tr√®s printani√®res. Dommage que ce type d'accroches ait tendance √† s'accrocher dans mes foulards."
"These earrings are amazing, they look as gorgeous as on the picture! It is clearly visible that they are made of good material, and the silver has a perfect gleam. There are 3 different possible positions so it fits the ear very nicely. The package was really cute, and Kathy is very nice and available should we have any questions. I am very very happy of this purchase, and I believe I will be ordering again some of her amazing creations. Thanks Kathy!"
"I absolutely looove these earrings. Kathy was very responsive when I had questions (was a bit worried about the weight, but they are light as a feather). They are beautifully made and I feel so confident while wearing them. I will definitely order more from her because there are plenty more other gems in her shop I have my eye on."
Love these!
"As pictured, great seller, very available for questions. Love my earrings!"
Sublimes! Je suis ravie !
Je l'adore !!
"D√®s l'ouverture, on tombe sur le charme. Bijou tr√®s fin et de tr√®s bonne qualit√©e. Merci encore pour ce magnifique bijou !"
Bijou vraiment tr√®s joli! Je repasserai probablement pour de futurs cadeaux :)
A photo will not do this beautiful piece of art any justice. I definitely will buy more. The earrings are gorgeous and easy to wear. The bar that goes through the ear is angled perfectly. You can truly feel the love that has gone into handcrafting each piece. Absolutely love my earrings and the artist (merchant). She is super quick in responding if you have any questions. Highly recommend this vendor!
Gorgeous pieces to add to your collection. Quality and just as pictured. Extra plus for fast shipping and the owner of the shop is very kind checking to see if I have received the item and also a little kind note with the purchase. Little gestures like this are very appreciated and go a long way. I am Very happy with my purchase and will let friends and family know about this shop. Thank you
These ear climbers were shipped quickly and I just love them. I wore them the first day they arrived and had three compliments on them. thanks for shipping so quickly!
"Love. Love them, so cute, took, but did take longer to ship then I thought."
Les boucles sont superbes ! Un grand merci !!! üòä
Wonderful earrings. Thank you very much
Article correspond √† la photo et √† mes attentes Les boucles sont trop jolies Petit plus sur l‚Äôemballage trop mimi Petit paquet individualis√©
"Fast shipping, love this design. I get compliments on them all the time! Great pair of earrings!! Love the simple pin style!"
This is my third pair of earrings from this seller love all of them will be buying again so comfortable thank you Regards Linda.
Not what I was expecting but they are well made and it's more my fault because I should have ordered the shiny silver...and I will sometime in the future!
In love with these earrings! Even more beautiful than the picture

They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
Commande re√ßue dans les d√©lais. Tr√®s contente de mon achat. Fait avec beaucoup de minutie.
Earrings are as described! Love them.
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
Heel mooiü•∞
"Love the Earrings! Got lots of compliments! The only thing that is upsetting me about these are the backs are not tight at all.. they were the first few days and then they got really loose.. so I constantly have to make sure the backs are all the way on. But besides that, I love them!!üòç‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è"
These are beautiful & have great detail! Just as shown! High quality & not difficult to get on & off! I will definitely be buying more from this seller :)
Llegaron r√°pido y me encantan. Son iguales que los de la foto. He recibido muchos cumplidos :) Los volver√≠a a comprar. They came fast and I love them. They are the same as the photo. I have received many compliments :) I would buy them again.
"These earrings are absolutely stunning! Quality craftsmanship and even more gorgeous in person. I am not one to leave reviews, but this earrings were totally worth the wait. I am so delighted with this purchase and this seller! I loved all the little details in the packaging too. It is obvious that the Artikats truly cares about the details from start to finish."
"Love it! Just got one side, so I can use some of my other singles on the other ear. :)"
I love these! They are very unique and well made. I just placed another order for the Leaf Climbers and matching ring. Love this shop!
Very lovely. I had them resized and they turned out beautiful. The delivery was fast too. :-)
"Earrings are beautiful and the packaging was pretty and thoughtful. (Included jewelry cleaning cloth, gift bag, gift box and storage bag for after wear.) These were a ft, but I may need to buy myself a pair. :)"
"Update: Yuju was so gracious and eached out to offer me an 16 inch chain and it completely transformed the necklace. I used it wear the necklace inside my clothes because it was long and too dangling, now I‚Äôm wearing it on top of my tops and so happy with it! :) I love this modern and organic design, I may consider getting this artists other pieces in the future. Tho I wish seller offer different necklace length as mine is a bit longer than I would normally wear, plus the hook of necklace came undone a couple of times."
"This is my second time to purchase this lovely budding necklace. I've had one for myself, and I found it's very well made, easy care and great design! So I decided to have it as a gift to my sis, and I know she will love it! It also comes with a gift box & a nice storage bag, which makes gifting much easier! Also, the shipping is very prompt. The end-to-end process only took several days. Very impressive. Highly recommend!"
So beautiful! I‚Äôm in love with this necklace and the packaging was so lovely. Will definitely be purchasing from again for future gifts
It is my first time shopping on Etsy and I am surprised by the good quality. It looks so pretty on my ears. It is not bulky and so comfortable. It goes so well with my floral print dress. I definitely recommend it to my friends! Absolutely love it!!!
Every piece of jewelry I‚Äôve gotten from them has been so beautiful! I can‚Äôt wait to see what else this shop will release. Shipping was within the expected time frame and no damage to any products when they arrived. Everything came just like what is shown in the pictures!
It is absolutely gorgeous! It's super comfy and not heavy at all. It shines beautifully in the light and are hands down my new favourite earrings!
"Absolute winners, I'd never worn anything in this joint style before but I'm glad I decided to try it. The purchase process was smooth and efficient and the final product is beautiful and elegant."
"Trop jolies, j'adore ! En plus, envoi rapide !"
"Tr√®s satisfaite, les boucles d'oreilles √©taient tr√®s bien emball√©es. Personne r√©active par message, a pu avancer le d√©lai de livraison √† ma demande. Je recommande"
Boucles d‚Äôoreilles aussi jolies que sur la photo. Ravie de mon achat. Merci Justine
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
The seller was very prompt at shipping. Let me tell you the ear cuffs are gorgeous and I would definitely recommend this shop for anyone. I was very skeptical as to how a simple lobe clip will hold entire cuffs weight onto ear. I had lot of problems keeping ear cuffs in position. These cuffs are light in weight and clip on lobe holds everything in place. Love it
This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are
"Amazing piece. I am absolutely in love with it. My helix piercing was done only few days ago, so I still have red ear and little pain. But it is still absolutely comfy, even with fresh piercing. It is very subtle and classy."
"Shipped fast (same state, for fairness) and it's awesome! Fits snuggly and looks amazing. Wish it had a tad more curve to it, but understand it's not a custom order. This is going to get a lot of wear!"
"I love, love, LOVE this earring! I was looking for something to enhance my helix pierced area, and this earring absolutely fits the bill. I would definitely recommend!"
This is exactly what I was looking for!!! It doesn't irritate my cartilage piercing like the other climbers that loop through the ear. Looks great. Now I need to buy the silver one too!
Sublimes! Je suis ravie !
Je l'adore !!
"D√®s l'ouverture, on tombe sur le charme. Bijou tr√®s fin et de tr√®s bonne qualit√©e. Merci encore pour ce magnifique bijou !"
Bijou vraiment tr√®s joli! Je repasserai probablement pour de futurs cadeaux :)
"LOVE MY EARRING!!! GREAT QUALITY LOOKS JUST LIKE PICTURE!!! YES, IF U LIKE EARRING U THING BY ALL MEANS HURRY UP AND BUY!!! THE ONLY REASON I DIDNT GIVE 5 STARS IS BECUZ IT TOOK SOMETIME B4 IT SHOWED UP... WILL BE BACK 4 MORE!!! ReCole Jones Seattle,WA"
"LOVE this!! It looks surprisingly classic on, but still totally satisfies my inner 90's grunge girl. It's very comfortable, well made, and so pretty! I love that you can thread it through more than one piercing if they're the right width apart."
Well crafted!
I am very happy with the quality and simplicity of my earrings. The seller is very friendly. When I purchased my first set of earrings it got lost in the mail and when I notified this shop they immediately sent me a replacement for free. I recommend this seller. Thank you very much!
"Passez votre chemin, sauf si vous ne prenez pas consid√©ration des d√©lais de livraison et de la qualit√© d'une communication..! La vendeuse elle n'y accorde aucune esp√®ce d'importance..! j'ai re√ßu un num√©ro de suivi qui apparaissait comme inconnu aupr√®s des services de la poste 5 jours apr√®s l'avoir re√ßu, j'en informe donc la vendeuse qui me demande de faire moi-m√™me la r√©clamation aupr√®s de la poste alors que le num√©ro est comme je l'ai indiqu√© inexistant, c'est logiquement √† l'exp√©diteur de le faire en fournissant les preuves d'envoi vu qu'elle seule pouvait les poss√©d√© , chose qui a enfin √©t√© faite au bout de plusieurs mails, plus d'une semaine, un √©change ex√©crable et un litige ouvert..!! Je d√©conseille vivement."
"La bague me pla√Æt mais un peu grande, j'ai du la mettre sur le pouce."
"Que des merveilles, dans cette boutique ! Je recommande vivement, et merci pour le joli cadeau !"
envoi rapide ! jolie perle
Item was great. These earrings are a little heavy to wear.
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."

"Ich liebe diese Ohrringe! Der Versand hat l√§nger gedauert als angegeben, da habe ich den Verk√§ufer angeschrieben und der Kundenservice ist mega! Man bekommt schnell Antworten und er hat ein neuer Paar losgeschickt. Sie sitzen super. Man muss sich ein bisschen an den Sitz und das an die Ohren klemmen gew√∂hnen, aber nach 2 Tagen klappts perfekt üòÑ Ich habe schon viele Komplimente bekommen und man bleibt nicht an den Ohrringen mit der FFP Maske h√§ngen. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Love them! Simple, something I can wear everyday to add a little touch. Especially since Covid, I‚Äôve been wearing absolutely no jewelry/earrings. So I like that I can look nice without being over the top. Definitely want these in the gold."
"I love these beautifully crafted ear cuffs. I love that they are delicate, stay on nicely and look edgy and pretty without having to pierce my ears. They have a sweet simplicity that compliments any style. Not only was I super pleased with the quality of the ear cuffs, the seller was more than helpful, pleasant, responsive and exceptional in every way! This review is because I would not hesitate to purchase from Benittamoko again."
"these don't really stay in my ears that well, but I think it has to do more with the shape of my ears rather than anything else. They are beautiful quality and they make for a gorgeous, unique ear curation."
"So stunning. I love it!!! *Just noting that in the picture I‚Äôm wearing it on the wrong ear, it‚Äôs supposed to be on the other so that the earring curves down (with the shape of the earlobe) and not up."
"Shipping took a bit longer because of covid and it being international, but totally worth the wait and M√≥nica from their team was very helpful and responsive. Love the piece and the quality, would (and will be) buying from this shop again!"
The earring was cute and dainty. They shipped super fast but it took a while for it to arrive due to covid. Great customer service. Thank you!
LOVE these. Just like the picture - so cute and easy to put on. Definitely will be buying from them again

They are small yet lovely. Piece was hallmarked as requested.
So beautiful. Simple but make a statement of beauty. The price is perfect. It did take a while to get to me with the covid and the fact they had to be shipped to the U.S. from Israel. But for sure worth the wait for such reasonably priced earrings!
So pretty in the rose gold. I'm very happy with my earrings. Thank you!
Fantastic earrings. They look even better in real life! Fast delivery. I would definitely recommend.
"These are simultaneously classy, trendy looking and attractive! Each time I have worn them I have received many compliments."
Gorgeous! Timely. Love them.
"Love them... Beautifully done, unique design!"
I love my earrings . Can't wait to wear them. Super fast delivery .
Everything I hoped for! Super cute packaging. I am actually using one on my helix piercing and it‚Äôs so cute!
I absolutely adored these! I bought these as a gift and they are so gorgeous! Wanting a pair for myself! Plus the little package it came in was so cute!
"Absolutely beautiful earrings! They are so magical! Wrapped with love, and sent promptly. I love them!"
Magical! Light pair of earrings that go with almost anything I wear!
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I will be back!
My daughter very happy w/ these earrings; thank you!!
Unique earrings will make a great Christmas present!
The quality is great and I'm not just saying that to say that. They might not be real but they look real and they exceeded my expectations. I have not worn them yet but believe me I'm just waiting for the right time to go out with my new outfit and show them off. I'm sure I will get plenty of compliments and I'm confident in that. Lovely just lovely and I'm a guy that's gay and I am proud of these earrings. Matter of fact as I'm writing this I'm getting ready to look and see if anything new has popped up. Thank you God bless and please be safe.
"this necklace is great! just as pictured. my only comment would be to add chain length to the item description because the smallest layer is almost too small on me, but otherwise I love it!"

It‚Äôs beautiful... it‚Äôs the earring I was looking for because it symbolizes something impostant...it was shipped on time.
Love this! No pressure/discomfort at all & stays in place.
"Conforme √† la photo, agr√©able √† porter. Re√ßue rapidement üòä"

"I was so pleased to see my most beautifully made custom pants, they are perfect, I feel very relaxed wearing them. Thank you for this venue to be able to share with others."
Tr?s jolie et conforme ? la photo. J'adore ??
"I love these earrings. I always worry about wearing heavy dangling earrings because I don't want my earlobes to get stretched out, but studs don't always cut it for a classy outfit. These are perfect, they are super light and elegant."
I bought these for my mom for Christmas and they shipped the following day! I received them 2 days later and they are so pretty! I know she's going to love them!
These are so pretty! I am very happy with this purchase.
"Very nice sweeps, fast shipping, thank you!"

"Beautiful earrings and such a lovely design, so well made. Lovely and light in my ears. I get so many compliments. The seller Pnina responds so quickly to messages and delightful to chat to. Highly recommend jewellery and the service. The delivery was quick too. Thank you Pnina."
Great customer service and equally great products! I just love my new earrings. Their quality is top notch and I get compliments when I wear them......which is all the time.
"It met all my expectations. I have other stud earrings that fit, as well!"
Beautiful earrings! When I saw them I wanted to know how long they would be and she sent me a picture right away.
"I really love these earrings. I need long post studs and they are a wonderful alternative. Super comfortable to sleep in. They do take a while to put them in, but it‚Äôs so worth it! I highly recommend for anyone that has semi new piercings."
"**UPDATE: I‚Äôve had these in since receiving them and although they are exactly the look I wanted, they are turning my ears green. I‚Äôm going to try coating them in clear nail polish to try extending the wear until I can get something else. So sad these didn‚Äôt work out.** I love these! Fit perfectly and exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. So happy I got these!"
"The earrings are just as described! They bend a little so be careful not to screw up the shape of them, but if you do it‚Äôs really easy to fix. Also would recommend making sure you check how the size will look on you because the three inch ones go all the way down to my shoulders which I was a little surprised by. Super cute tho!"
"Got my sister and me matching necklaces. She loved the minimalist design. Quality not compromised in the simple design. Came really fast, too"
"So happy I purchased these!!! I'd been in search for wedding earrings for a while and kept coming back to these. I finally purchased them, a little late so I had to express ship them but the seller was very friendly and helpful and the earrings are BEAUTIFUL. 10/10 recommend!"
"Th√© earings are very beautiful and Dana very Kind good service. Th√© only fact is to be carefull with custom device because i live In europe, i had to pay 30 euros more. Thank you for you good customer service."
gorgeous. made it just in time to USA. quality superb.
"Belle cr√©ation, surprises additionnelles avec le coli, je remarquerai juste que la protection de l'emballage est peut √™tre un peu faible par rapport √† la fragilit√© de l'objet (enveloppe simple papier bulle). Le mien n'√©tait pas endomag√©, mais je dis ca pour conseiller, merci encore !"
Le produit comble mes attentes et la livraison rapide ! La surprise √©tait tr√®s agr√©able et je remercie Sarrayan pour sa g√©n√©rosit√© !
"There was a little snafu with the shipping. But, Jan worked with me and re-sent the item. Love the Watch. Customer service was Awesome!"
As presented. Very good communication from the seller
"These earrings weren‚Äôt quite AS big and prominent as pictured, or maybe I‚Äôm not as petite as the model. STILL ADORE THEM. I wore them for my wedding with my cream and rose gold mid-century cut dress and they were PERFECT."
"These are really fun earrings. And, they go on easily. They are a big presence and not too weighty either. Love the unique look. Would love to have these with a big crystal ball instead of a pearl also."
"Absolutely LOVE these earrings!! So quirky and cool, super comfortable and easy to wear and the quality was great, especially for such a reasonable price! The customer service was excellent - so helpful and friendly. Shipping was really quick. Thanks so much, I'll be buying from you again!"
"Look amazing in real life, interesting way of fixing the earring into the ear (the pearl is detachable). Sturdily made & lovely design. Good experience with this shop. üéÅüîÆ‚ú®‚ú®"
"This is the coolest! I think the post is a little thicker than a conventional earring, because I have some trouble getting it in, but besides that I think these are fabulous. I got the climber in addition to a single star stud, and both earrings are well made, sturdy, and super light weight - I actually forget that I'm wearing them sometimes. They also come in the cutest little jar, which I'm saving to store them in. And Arajera also sends along a little thank you card with care instructions on it, which I really appreciate. Super pleased with my purchase! Thank you. :)"
"I love these earrings! They were a bit hard to get in the first day because I hadn't worn earrings in a few weeks and my holes had tightened up, and these are sliiightly thicker than my normal posts. I just wore my heaviest dangles for a few hours to stretch the holes a bit and the next day they went right in like a dream! They look so cute, I've wanted a pair of these for years so I'm so glad I finally got them!"
"The quality of the product is great! Just a couple of notes, though: I ordered it at the end of November and I received it in early January. (I live in the U.S.) I should have looked at the shipping details more closely- if you're ordering from the U.S, do prepare to wait a while. Also, I had previously stretched my ears; they've closed up now, but if you have larger piercing holes, prepare for this earring to jut out a bit when you wear it. Still looks nice, not too noticeable! Ara does great work. :)"
"Beautiful ear climber! Ordered the earring to wear on my left ear and it didn't fit quite how I wanted, but that's honestly because my ear lobes are very small. I tried it on my right ear, upside down, instead and it fits perfectly! Wonderful craftsmanship and packaging :)"
"Really beautiful! Everyone who sees it loves them at first sight! Excellent work ,excellent shop,excellent people!!Thank you so much! Œ†œÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œ± œÄŒ±ŒΩŒµŒºŒøœÅœÜŒ±!ŒüœÄŒøŒπŒøœÇ œÑŒ± Œ≤ŒªŒµœÄŒµŒπ œÑŒ± ŒªŒ±œÑœÅŒµœÖŒµŒπ Œ±ŒºŒµœÉœâœÇ!ŒïŒæŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑ Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒµŒπŒ±,ŒµŒæŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÑŒπŒ∫Œø Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑ŒºŒ± ,ŒµŒæŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÑŒπŒ∫ŒøŒπ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒπ!

"I ordered these earrings Dec 14 and they arrived in Ontario, Canada on Jan 23. The long wait was totally worth it! They are beautiful and exactly what I expected. I emailed asking if it would be possible to modify the design to make the sun red and have a woman without a baby. Sotiria sent me a photo showing me the modifications they were making and asking if they were what I wanted. These are so unique and well made - a real work of art! Great service too!"
"I love this style of jewelry. It is bold, noticeable and very distinct. Get lots of compliments. I bought six pieces and love them all. Wish i could buy more."
"I LOVE it! It left Athens, 18 December arrived NZ 6 Jan, that was with the Christmas mail. Beautifully packaged. I now have my cat ""wrapped around my liitle finger""!"
"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
"Favoriting the shop and on the look out for new designs. Not as rose gold as I thought it would be but i loooove the look of it :) It's pretty comfortable and so far it feels nonexistent on my ears. I have incredibly sensitive ears as well, so that's saying a lot."

My wife and I loved our white enameled Starburst necklace and ICXC NIKA necklace. Niovi was super sweet and helpful and our package arrived quickly. I will be ordering more very soon ‚ù§Ô∏è
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
"I bought these for my elopement wedding and I could not be more impressed! They are stunning in size and quality. The ship time was super quick even from Israel to DC in a pandemic. Thank you so much, you made me feel like a princess on my special day."
So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
Absolutely beautiful! So pleased with this earrings. Perfect for my wedding day.
I think these are my new favorites! Love them!

These earrings are absolutely beautiful! Shipping was unbelievably fast. I will definitely order again!
They are perfect! Exactly what I wanted!
I bought the little bar stud mainly for my second lobe. Perfect size. Pretty happy with it :)
"Absolutely stunning! The ring ist very delicate and light, I barely feel it on my finger, but yet very stable. I doesn't feel like it would break right away. I love it, thank you ü•∞"

This ring is so cute and the owner seems so nice and even wrote me a little note!!!! Shipped super quickly too!
I wear these in my first love. They are beautiful and fall in exactly the right place. I bought a total of three sets of earrings from this seller (all pictured in my lobes). These are the perfect combination of sparkle and opal. I‚Äôve showered in them and worked out in them but they have no turned green. The backs fit securely and I never feel at risk of losing the earrings. I love these so much. I‚Äôll definitely purchase more from this seller.
"These are so dainty and sophisticated! They match my other earrings perfectly. I'm glad I shopped with Sami. Quick USPS delivery too! I got gold hoops from her shop too (pictured), they look lovely together :)"
"Exactly as pictured and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôve bought a few pairs off Etsy and they‚Äôre always way bigger than pictured and these are so pretty and they fit my ear perfectly. I have them in my second lobe piercing, pointed towards my arch and it looks so nice. I‚Äôll probably buy from the seller again."
"I ordered this item to put my second-hole piercings to use and loved these as soon as I saw them. I also started wearing rose gold jewelry recently like rings and necklaces so I wanted to add a little something extra to my everyday look (super casually styled gal here üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) over all, I love them and the quality of the rose gold itself is amazing just as well as the opal and jewels. 10/10 would recommend"

Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
I absolutely love these earrings. The stone stud is the perfect size and I love the detail on the circles. I want them in onyx too!
"ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!! They sparkle, excellent quality, they are lightweight, and iloniti was a pleasure to work with!! 10 out of 10 would shop from her store again!! I can‚Äôt wait to wear these on my wedding day üåüüåüüåü"
"Incredible. Absolutely breathtaking , and photos just don‚Äôt do these earrings justice. The sparkle is gorgeous, and rose gold is perfect! I had been these in my cart for months, and finally just decided to buy them, and I am so glad I did. Worth every cent. They will make the perfect statement for my jewelry on my wedding day. I cannot thank iloniti for her beautiful craftsmanship!!!"
I‚Äôm going to look so glam and fashionable thanks to these earrings! Even my fianc√© was wowed by them! Very lightweight so your ears won‚Äôt hurt by the end of the night and it comes with an adjustable piece for the climber part. You won‚Äôt regret buying this for your day!

"These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! I was nervous ordering something from so far away as Russia and I will never feel that way again. It does take a little longer naturally, because of the distance, but they came in a very reasonable time and these earrings are worth the wait. I will definitely buy again. The earrings are just perfect! The size, the price, the quality...stunning. Thank you so much! Estella"
Luv them!!!
Absolutely gorgeous earrings. Just like the photo. Seller was incredibly nice and helpful. It took quite a while to get to me but the pandemic is still ongoing which could have caused a mail delay. I will buy more from her shop. Very unique.
"The brooch just arrived and it is stunningly beautiful! I will definitely buy more from your company in the future. I live in the United States and it took a few months to arrive because of the obvious distance/international pandemic, but it was well worth the wait! The piece is truly one of a kind."
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!"
"These earrings are absolutely STUNNING. I wore them for my wedding day and I received so many compliments. It was the perfect unique and modern touch, with just the right amount of glam and elegance. You can tell they are made with a lot of attention to detail. The customer service was also fantastic and so helpful in finding just want I wanted. I'll wear them over and over!"
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!

Tolle Ohrringe. Haben mir sofort gefallen. Sie sind nicht zu gro√ü und filigran vom Design. Super f√ºr den Sommer. Auch die Patina gef√§llt mir gut.
super mooie oorbellen!! blij mee
Love this piece. Beautifully designed and fits my ear perfectly.
"The items are beautiful, nicely handcrafted with a lovely and delicate design. They fit elegantly on the ears. The seller is an absolute star: the parcel got lost on the way and the seller simply resend the goods via courrier at no extra cost. Thank you so much!"
"Beware!!!! Don‚Äôt do it these earrings look nothing like the pic more like a paper clip but if you do order it, it came in a timely manner and I waited to long to return them so I paid $60 for paper clips"
Beautiful earrings and well made. Shipping was exceptionally fast considering the epidemic and that they arrived from Europe. I am very happy with them!
"Superbe collier, je l'ai re√ßu dans les temps. Trop contente de mon achat üòâüòä"

Beautiful pair of earrings. Thank you.
"Beautiful earrings, exquisitely crafted! Terrific customer service as well, very forthcoming and helpful with information, and went out of their way to make sure the item was just right."
The opals are gorgeous & full of fire! The pearls have an unbelievable mirror luster! The photo does not do them justice. So beautiful. I have purchased a pearl necklace from thePearlStory previously that has made me the envy of my friends. Very happy with my purchases.
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
I had to switch these out for a different pair only because my ears are a bit smaller than average and it didn't sit right. Ilona to the rescue! She was so accommodating and allowed me to seamlessly exchange for a pair that perfectly compliment my headpiece and dress. Thank you soooo much!
"This ear climber is truly brilliant; the sparkle is superlative! Quality is sturdy, and it stays in place for hours without leaving my ear feeling sore as other cartilage clips and magnets have done. Shipping was fast and the earrings were spotless and nicely packaged; I'm so looking forward to wearing this climber to several upcoming occasions! Thank you Iloniti!"

"Exactly as pictured and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôve bought a few pairs off Etsy and they‚Äôre always way bigger than pictured and these are so pretty and they fit my ear perfectly. I have them in my second lobe piercing, pointed towards my arch and it looks so nice. I‚Äôll probably buy from the seller again."
"I ordered this item to put my second-hole piercings to use and loved these as soon as I saw them. I also started wearing rose gold jewelry recently like rings and necklaces so I wanted to add a little something extra to my everyday look (super casually styled gal here üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) over all, I love them and the quality of the rose gold itself is amazing just as well as the opal and jewels. 10/10 would recommend"
These ear cuffs are beautiful and elegant! Very well made! They look very nice on the ear. Very comfortable to wear. Shipping was very quick. Would definitely buy from this seller again! They came in a very nice little bag made of soft material. Very pleased with purchase! Thank you for making these ear cuffs!
Beautiful! Worth every penny I love them!
So pretty and intricate. Arrived very quickly and wore them the next day.

dainty & beautiful! Loved them
"Very dainty rose gold earrings. Easy to put in and looking forward to wearing them ongoing! They are definetly thinner than I thought they would be, but still pretty"
"I love these earrings, they were a little weirdly big so I had to adjust the back a bit so they wouldn't fall off but other than that they look beautiful even though I don't have the best wire bending skills."
These earrings are beautiful and look exactly as advertised. Shipping was prompt and I will absolutely order from this seller again!
Looks amazing! Shipped fast.

"So happy with my purchase! I ended up changing my mind about my original order, and Ellie the shop owner was very helpful with helping me pick out earrings that would work for me. The earrings were perfect‚Äîdainty and cute and perfect for work, casual events, or even dressing up. She even included a sweet extra item. Everything came neatly packaged, and the shipping was so quick. I‚Äôm excited to wear the earrings. Thank you, NaiaJewelry!"
I‚Äôm super satisfied with my purchase! I got a bracelet and earrings and was pleasantly surprised with how fast the shipping was. The bracelet and earrings came in cute packaging and looked exactly like their photos! Would purchase from NAIA again!
Ordered the Camille open hoop earrings and they are absolutely gorgeous! I‚Äôm typically a traditional hoops gal and this pair added a great unique touch. It also came in cute packaging and arrived sooner than expected. Highly recommend!
I love these earrings because they are so unique! Can‚Äôt wait to rock these on my zooms calls at work! :)
"I am sooo happy with these earrings, they are my favorite and have been wearing these every day! Thank you so much!"

"The earrings arrived earlier than estimated which was a plus, but it was damaged during transport. Luckily, I was able to get them replaced promptly. The whole process was pretty straightforward. Would definitely purchase from Ellie again!"
"My new favorite climber earrings! Unique, comfortable to wear, and perfect size. Great quality, not flimsy where you are afraid the will easily break!!"
17-year old great niece loved them! Her first pair of climbers.
Absolutely delighted with these . So well made. Quick delivery and messages answered . Will definitely use you again.
It's exactly what she wanted. Just like the picture. Thank you.
The earrings are so cute and great quality! And the seller added in two extra pairs to my order :) so very excited
"So cute! Love how they were dainty but still detailed,"
Unbalanced earring pair gets attention in the best way. They were a gift for someone who works in corporate America and enjoys adding style to her wardrobe without being too flashy. She loves them very much
Arrived quickly! Very nice. Thank you!
"They were beautiful, completely handmade and so special for my baby girls nursery. I just wish I ordered more!"

I love these earrings!They are so unique!
WOW . . . perfect little size and incredible quality!!!
They don't really stay facing upwards as I imagined but they are beautiful.
"These earrings are so cute! And the seller is great, she made the delivery extra special. Thank you!"
"I LOVE these earrings! I got them in gold because sterling silver irritates my skin and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. They also shipped way faster than the estimated date, so that was a bonus. Will definitely be buying again from Kolera! So many cute quality pieces for a very reasonable price."
"I received my necklaces, anklets and earrings and I must say they are high quality pieces that I can wear every day and will for a long time! Michelle is such a lovely seller. She was so patient and understanding with all of my questions. This was my first purchase and will not be my last! I look forward to adding more Kolera jewellery to my collection!"
"I purchased the octagon locket with 24‚Äù chain for my mother‚Äôs 65th birthday. She absolutely loved it! Gorgeous, modern, timeless and hand crafted beautifully. Has the 925 stamp. The chains length can also be adjusted without tools by hooking it on one of the chain loops and letting the rest of the chain dangle at the back. Handy if you‚Äôre unsure of what length to get. Michelle went above and beyond when I had questions. Wonderful woman to work with. Shipped fairly quickly. I highly recommend her shop!! :)"
These hoops earrings are perfect. They're exactly the thickness that I wanted. I am so pleased!
Love this earcuff! Shipping was fast and support was also really good at helping me with a few questions! The details from the snake are incredible and it is super comfortable to wear in the ear. I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased. Will definitely be getting more! Thank you‚Äîthis was just what I needed!
Love it! It doesn‚Äôt fit my ear we‚Äôre it is worn in the picture though. But I wear it more up like a helix hoop and it looks amazing.
"It's very cute, I love it !"
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!
My item shipped very quickly and I‚Äôm very happy with it. Looking forward to wearing my earring on my wedding day:)
"Stunning pair of earrings! Well made, prompt service. Thank you Dana!"
So beautiful! I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!
Just beautiful. Light catching and eye catching. I‚Äôve worn them for daytime and evening occasions. Always met with admiring eyes ü•∞
Stunning. I keep purchasing from this seller because the pieces are great quality. Also a very friendly seller!
"I love these mismatched earrings, they are whimsical and elegant at the same time. Great quality! :)"
Sooo pretty ! Love that I can add/remove the extra pieces.

I love these! They are so cute. Substantial feeling too- like they won‚Äôt break ever. I also love the length up my ear :) I‚Äôm so happy! Thank you! I‚Äôll be back for more!!!!
Beautiful! I am in love with these! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I love my new climber earrings!!!...Customer service was excellent too.
I love them!! ‚ù§Ô∏è They are beautiful! I can‚Äôt wait to wear them; well wear one of them because I have so many piercings on my left ear. üòÇ
"Good craftsmanship and the metal is thick and substantial. The earrings are a bit longer though than the bottom of the earlobe, but it doesn't look bad. They are very eye-catching. However, they are hard to put on because the back curves up a bit. If I were the seller, I would make the back part that curves up shorter. The seller also sent a free gift which I do appreciate. Good product for the value!"
Absolutely gorgeous! I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on these already.
"I love these earrings! They're just as pictured and have posts about 11mm long so they fit comfortably on my ears, I'm so glad I bought them!"
"Never even considered a piece like this until I saw it and then put it on. Super unique and pretty and a little badass, really interesting pieces here. Love it!"
J'adore . Excellente communication avec Tribu bubu. Merci pour le petit cadeau suppl√©mentaire.

"I was so excited to receive my order today! I received the (blue) rain cloud earrings. The earrings are beautiful, they come exactly as listed! They even added an extra pair of backings just in case. This shop had amazing customers service! I needed to do a quick address change and they were able to fix that for me with no problems. I even received a very cute, handwritten thank you card! Put a huge smile on my face. I‚Äôll definitely order from them again."
My earrings got to me super quick and it came along with a handwritten note which added a sweet personal touch.
It's so cute and better than i expected!
I love the earings ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"beautiful. it looks like the one on the picture. i just have a slight problem- because it doesn‚Äôt stay on one place ;-)) maybe it is my ear having a problem? :-)) other then that, really great and good quality work. arrived fast. i will order again, this time a longer one. :) thank you."
Elegant and minimalist. Plus quick delivery.
I'm very happy with the earrings; they are beautiful and exactly what I was hoping they would look like. They arrived from France to Netherlands in 4 days so very quick delivery. Thanks Oph√©lie for your good service and I really recommend you to all buyers.
Je vous remercie pour la rapidit√© de l‚Äôenvoi et surtout pour la qualit√© de vos produits !! Je suis tr√®s contente d‚Äôavoir commander chez vous üòä

"I'm wearing these for my wedding, they are so pretty."
"LOVE these ear jacket earrings, extremely stylish and very versatile. Highly recommend."
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
"As a consumer who is new to Etsy, I am extremely pleased with the customer service of this seller. I had to return the first pair of earrings because of the design of the backing that did not work for my ears. The seller was quick to respond to inquiries and are so easy to work with returns. I also appreciate their super fast shipping unlike the other sellers who will wait for 3 days before processing orders. Lastly, I am amazed on the integrity of the description of their products. I doubted that the lab-created diamonds will look like real diamonds but I was wrong. Their created diamonds have a VVS1 clarity which makes them great in quality and perfect with the naked eye. If you own real diamonds you will know why these clarity ratings are important. I would definitely buy from this seller again!"
"I‚Äôm posting this review so others can see the relative size (3 mm). None of the other reviews (including the one other review w a photo) mentioned what size they bought. The earrings are cute and pretty much as expected. Not as clear as I thought they‚Äôd be, but am happy they‚Äôre not gold-filled/-plated. The backs are very tiny, so even with my small fingers, they were hard to handle. But, for the quality and price, it‚Äôs a minor concession! Also, the seller was quick to answer my question and ship them out. Really happy all-around!"
"My daughter loved these. I bought two pairs, love the quality, and they are beautiful! The pricing was awesome, and I couldn't be happier!!"
These earrings really are beautiful! Very sparkly! ‚ú® Love them! I purchased two pairs of 5mm and one pair of 4mm. They look the same as my real diamond earrings.
I highly recommend this earring! the shipment was very fast and maytal is super nice and very responsive. looks just like the photo :)
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
I purchased these ear climbers for my daughter as a gift. She loved them. They are beautiful and unique. I hesitated about ordering internationally but decided to take the chance considering they were my favorite when compared to many others listed. Maytal was in close contact with me throughout the shipping process with delays as expected due to the pandemic. Her customer service and concern were superb...she updated me frequently until they arrived at my post office. I would not hesitate in ordering from her in the future.
Finally got them Nikki & I luv them. They are so light. Well done Cheers Kate
I love this ring! It's great quality and the perfect size for my hand. The ring itself is a little large size-wise but that's okay. I'd rather it be a little big rather than too small. I thought coming from New Zealand to the US would take a really long time. But I got it faster than I got a package from England. Very pleased!
I bought the beautiful ring from Nikki first and was so happy that I asked her to make me the bangle to match for my daughters 21st. I am delighted both with the result and the service offered. I gave Nikki a tight time frame and she hand delivered to make sure the bangle arrived in time for the party. Thanks again Nikki....love it!
"I love it! It was a little big, so it means I can wear it almost on any finger I want :) I like the way you are wearing in this photo, but it is also nice to wear it opposite way. Thank you very much, Nikki, for your patient communication and making it such a special one for me!"
This bracelet was perfect. It came in a lovely presented box with ribbon and frills. The piece itself looked just like the pictures. It was beautiful and a great gift for my girlfriend. I would rate the quality of work highly.
Tr√®s tr√®s joli. D'une finesse absolue. Aucun regret. Livraison ultra rapide. Emballage parfait. Je recommande.
Tr√®s jolies BO. J'aime leur √©l√©gance et la finesse du travail du fil d'argent. La livraison a √©t√© ultra rapide dans un emballage tr√®s s√©curis√© + un bel √©crin pour les prot√©ger. Merci √† sheilandi pour son professionnalisme.

"Magnifiques boucles b oreilles ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è encore plus belles en vrai qu en photo pour √™tre honn√™te. De top qualit√© ( comme toujours sur cette boutique). Je suis juste ravie, elles sont superbes et pas trop lourdes !! Ce qui est parfait. Re√ßues dans un joli paquet aux senteurs de lavande , un vrai bonheur ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Elles sont TELLEMENT belles que je les porte tous les jours !! Je les adore :D L'envoi a √©t√© tr√®s rapide, et les bijoux emball√©s avec soin Merci infiniment pour votre travail !"
"Elles sont magnifiques, je les adore. Re√ßues bien emball√©es et super rapidement. Merci pour cette belle cr√©ation qui r√©veille mon c√¥t√© witch!"
Magnifiques boucles d'oreilles ! La vendeuse a fait de son mieux pour que je re√ßoive la commande √† temps pour un anniversaire.
I absolutely love these earrings. They were purchased as a gift from my daughter for my birthday and they arrived promptly and are really pretty. Thank you so much - I love them :-)
"Very happy with purchase. Great service and value for money. Arrived very quickly, much appreciated and well packaged. Good quality. Bought for a gift to a friend who loved the earrings. Will definitely be purchasing again and recommending to friends and family. Thank you very much."
My wife really loves these earrings. They look very pretty and very comfortable to wear. Dispatched very quickly. Thank you. Would definately recommend saltycoconut.
"My daughter was thrilled with these earrings, I was glad we didn‚Äôt need any more piercings. M"
"I actually ordered these for myself as a gift after my furbaby crossed the rainbow bridge. They are so delicate and beautiful. They look like they'd cost much, much more than they do. I'm absolutely in love!"
"The earrings are beautiful and feel sturdy enough for daily wear. They are a smidgeon smaller than I anticipated (they're not easily visible on my chubby earlobe), but they are wonderful and comfortable. Also, the shipping was super fast, the package was smartly and safely packed, and arrived in perfect condition."
These are dainty which is what I was looking for. I love big bold earrings but my bestie's twins will wreak havoc on my ears with them. So I had to look for baby safe earrings that were still bold. Fast shipping and the packaging was minimal but beautiful.
"I love these climbers! I immediately put on and admired myself in the mirror üòÇ I also ordered some opal earrings, both pair are absolutely adorable! Thanks bunches! üåª"
Lovely earrings thank you. I like them worn down as well as along the lobe.
"These are really lovely, look very striking. The earrings themselves are shaped like a hair grip and you can adjust the fit to make sure they stay in place. Very pleased with them, thank you!"
"Really dainty and elegant, really love these! My first ever pair of earrings! Shipped quickly and arrived before expected date."
"I recently had a pixie cut and these earrings compliment my new hairstyle quite well! They are bold and fun, which exactly what I wanted :)"
"These are gorgeous!!! Much better than the photos! The contrast of blue and white is stunning. .. Although the size of the clip is smaller than others, and not secure, and slipped off,, quickly,,, resulting in getting lost. ( I loved them so much that I insisted on putting them back on many times.) I deducted a star for that. Quick delivery, good packaging and a great personal feel to the service. Thanks Fad√©la ""ClipAddict"" !!!"
I love the mother of pearl clip on top and the beautiful iridescent colors in the shell. I wore these earrings with my mother of pearl ring. They looked great together.
"These pretty Green and blue Crystal & Silver clip earnings are simply gorgeous. Beautiful Crystal beads and clip on's ! Hard to find quality earrings in clip on, not pierced, so I was very pleased to find these. So well packaged and presented.. Thank You Diane OC CA USA"
These earrings came faster than expected even though I ordered them on a busy weekend. Beautiful. Chi miigwech!
I ordered Porcupine earrings from here and absolutely LOVE them! I had asked about the sizing of the earrings and they were really kind in answering questions and even sent me a picture of a few of the earrings to choose from. They responded within the hour I had asked about them. I had the earrings within 2 weeks after ordering. Would definitely recommend buying from this vendor.
Most beautiful earrings I own! Absolutely in love!
Magnifique ! Service rapide et implacable. Je l'ai offert en cadeau et la personne √©tait tr√®s contente. Il est magnifique.
"i had a custom order. she and i talked a lot about what i wanted and she even took pics of everything so i could see before she sent it to me. she did everything perfectly. i am a happy camper to say the least. she is FANTASTIC. don't be afraid to ask for custom work, you can get anything that the artist can provide within reason..it works."
"Alors comment dire... J'ai flash√© sur ce sautoir ! Malheureusement √† la r√©ception je l'ai trouv√© bien trop court. J'ai longuement r√©fl√©chi, c'√©tait ma premi√®re commande chez Julie. Est-ce que je vais l'ennuyer avec mes probl√®mes de centim√®tres ou pas ? Je le conserve comme √ßa mais je ne le mettrai pas ? Et j'ai tent√© le coup ! Et Julie a r√©pondu √† toutes mes attentes. Elle m'a rallong√© la ""b√™te"" (c'est le nom d√©sormais de mon sautoir) et il est magnifique, pil poil ce que j'attendais. D'ailleurs je le porte aujourd'hui ! Alors mille mercis Julie, et conseil √† toutes vos futures clientes : allez y les yeux ferm√©s !"
this was a custom piece too and it came out just right too! she is just a true artist. i love her work. if you want something special try Julie's work .she will not disappoint.
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles conformes √† la description... Comme je l'ai dit pr√©c√©demment colis re√ßu avec retard (plus de 15 jours au lieu des 1 √† 3 jours ouvr√©s annonc√©s) d'autant que c'√©tait un cadeau d'anniversaire...date largement d√©pass√©e... Vraiment dommage car ses cr√©ations me plaisaient beaucoup... mais grande h√©sitation.
"I love this piece! It‚Äôs so cute! I will say that if you like leaving your jewelry in for long periods of time, you will need to like just go over the jewelry with like a cotton swab and something to clean it with. Gets kinda dirty fast for some reason! Will buy from this seller again. Lol I‚Äôm like super faded in the pic but it shows the jewelry so whatever lol"
"I love the nose ring so much I ordered 4! Lol, for my double nostril and double helix."
"Shipping was incredibly fast. Ear crawler is very unique, just as pictured and and I am satisfied with this overall purchase. Thank you"
I love this nose ring. It‚Äôs so beautiful and I get compliments all the time. Shipping was fast!
This is a beautiful piece of jewelry. I love the length. I received it within 2 days of ordering
"Gorgeous. Everything from Harry Mason studios is gorgeous. FAST! Rec'd before promised date. Packaging was excellent. The staff has always been friendly, professional, knowledgeable. Although Harry has passed, his spirit is in this new outlet via ETSY. Will definitely keep an eye open. Wishing the shop the very best."
Absolutely more stunning than the photo. Super comfortable and makes my ears look like a piece of art. The shipping was super fast. Sorry to hear about Harry Mason's passing. I plan to pass these down to my daughter.
"Sehr entz√ºckende Ohrstecker! Ich habe schon lange nach passenden Perlenohrringen gesucht und hier nun endlich f√ºndig geworden. Mit den Katzen√∂hrchen perfekt, als w√§ren sie f√ºr mich designt. Ganz liebevoll verpackt :))) Ich bestelle gerne wieder!"
"Ravie de mon achat. Ravissantes BO, d√©licates et l√©g√®res. Un must have!! Livr√©es dans un joli pochon en tissu."
Livraison rapide. Vendeuse √† l'√©coute et tr√®s r√©active. Les BO re√ßues sont tr√®s jolies et conformes √† ce que j'attendais ! Merci :)
"The earrings looks even more stunning in person! So beautiful, can‚Äôt wait to where them for my wedding. Earrings were packaged beautifully."
These are too gorgeous and they were well packaged. Definitely recommend anyone on the fence if they are worth it. Can't wait to wear on my wedding day!
They are beautiful and it will help make my daughters wedding so much more
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I can't say enough about this fabulous shop! Courtney was an absolute pleasure to work with and did an amazing job packing and shipping my purchase. My earrings arrived very quickly and were expertly packed using high quality materials. She even sent an unprompted note after shipment advising me on the best way to keep the earrings from pulling/drooping on my ears. I would shop here again in a heartbeat and have added MarhevCo to my favorites. I highly recommend Courtney and her shop for fine estate jewelry purchases. A+++ experience from start to finish!
"I think it did a ""road tour"" of the US for over 3 weeks before finally leaving that country & arriving in mine, much to my delight. Eye-catching ! The camera does not do it justice- throws sparkles of colour whenever the light catches it- & we have sooo much light over here! Thank you."
I bought a vintage engagement ring that needed to be resized. Courtney was incredibly helpful and had the ring resized and to me in record time (even during a pandemic). I absolutely recommend this shop to anyone looking for unique vintage jewelry
I kove this necklace. It's long as promised!!
"stunning, simple pearl drop. My cousin loved them!"
Craftsmanship and an amazing color! Loved the gift wrapping and my friend was over the moon with her necklace.
This was a gift and I just simply adore them. The packaging and craftsmanship are superb. Great design.
This necklace is absolutely gorgeous!!! It was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it!! The shipping was extremely fast and I highly recommend this shop to anyone that loves unique and quality jewelry!!! I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again!!!

"Subtiles et raffin√©es , je les adore! Tr√®s gaies, tr√®s printani√®res. Dommage que ce type d'accroches ait tendance √† s'accrocher dans mes foulards."
Tolle Ohrringe. Haben mir sofort gefallen. Sie sind nicht zu gro√ü und filigran vom Design. Super f√ºr den Sommer. Auch die Patina gef√§llt mir gut.
super mooie oorbellen!! blij mee
Tr√®s jolies boucles. Bonne qualit√©. Bon rapport qualit√© prix Je suis ravie. Merci üôÇ
"Pierre vraiment plus claire et plus ""fade"" que sur la photo"
"These pink jade pierced earrings are pretty, but a lighter pink color than shown on my computer. They are a soft pink, not a bright pink. The earrings are well-made, safely packaged, and timely shipped. Thank you."
I just received this today and it is such a beautiful piece!!! I really love it. The shipping was really fast too. Thank you so much!
Everything I hoped for! Super cute packaging. I am actually using one on my helix piercing and it‚Äôs so cute!
I absolutely adored these! I bought these as a gift and they are so gorgeous! Wanting a pair for myself! Plus the little package it came in was so cute!
"Absolutely beautiful earrings! They are so magical! Wrapped with love, and sent promptly. I love them!"
Magical! Light pair of earrings that go with almost anything I wear!
Love this ring! I think the sizing is maybe a bit off. I am usually an 8 US for my index but I needed to order a 9 in this ring. We got one for all the ladies in my immediate family and it's a big hit.
"These earrings are just so cute!! Such a simple design, but adds a really great quirky vibe to everyday jewelry :)"
"Absolutely love this necklace! The clasp is a little hard to work with but such great quality for the price! It took quite a while to get here but the seller was very responsive and professional, and I wasn‚Äôt in a hurry to receive it just wanted to make sure I would receive it - Etsy gives an estimated date that‚Äôs about 3 weeks off, but I also live in the US and it ships from Canada so there‚Äôs a delay!"
Delicate. Minimalist. Perfect for my girlfriend who wants something beautiful without being too flashy
"The earrings looks even more stunning in person! So beautiful, can‚Äôt wait to where them for my wedding. Earrings were packaged beautifully."
These are too gorgeous and they were well packaged. Definitely recommend anyone on the fence if they are worth it. Can't wait to wear on my wedding day!
They are beautiful and it will help make my daughters wedding so much more
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
"I‚Äôve been searching for peace sign hoops like this for some time now, and am so glad I found By Bella! The earrings are high quality, beautifully made, and exactly as pictured. I love that the business does such wonderful community outreach, and feel good knowing I‚Äôve contributed even just a small bit to their mission. These will be a joy to wear :)"
"Best face mask. Breathable! Fits exceptionally well, very pretty, shipped promptly. Good nosewire (really does keep the glasses from fogging!) and very happy to have the ear loop adjusters. Wore it today for the first time. It is my new FAV!! Conversed with someone for over an hour and the mask stayed in place! I think it may be that the origami style is the best one on the market. This one checks all the boxes for the right stuff!! Priced well too."
"This mask is gorgeous! It fits perfectly, and arrived in just under 4 days. Can't wait to try it with my glasses while walking at the dog park. Pics to follow. Thank you!"
"It was JUST what we needed. I really like the 3-D fit especially for my children who cannot see to keep a mask over their noses and these are perfect. They also have a filter pocket, which was necessary in my book. In addition, my children's and husband's ears get tires after full days of wear and this vendor was able to make them around the head versus earloops, which is something no other vendor was willing to do!!! Had to buy more!"
Super great help from seller. Very nice and great to work with. 5 stars
Great purchase. Had a little uh-oh but I had the best experience ever with my order! Super cute earring! Absolutely in love and have gotten compliments on it every time I have worn it so far. Thank you!
This was my first casual (non-bling) piece from Queen Culture. I love everything from this vendor! They pairs well with all the colors and stands out well with all black. I received them in the cutest little jewelry box. I appreciate the professional packaging. SOLID MINORITY WOMAN-OWNED SMALL BHSINESS!!!üó£
I love these earrings! I like a bit of flash but can't stand heavy jewelry. These were exactly what I needed. I got compliments all night on them. I've worn them a few times with no issues. I'm already looking to buy a backup pair and my next Queen Culture piece. Will definitely be back.
Truly can‚Äôt go wrong with any purchase here... the quality and shipping are always great.
Exactly as pictured. Beautiful
"LOVE the earrings! No reaction at all, i have sensitive ears. I‚Äôve seen some reviews saying the backs of the earrings are longer than expected, but that‚Äôs not my experience at all. Perfect length & don‚Äôt poke me in my sleep. Beautiful, simple set. Very fast shipping too!"
"I got these earrings in gold. These are the cutest, flattering, minimalist, shining earrings I have ever own. I think the way it dangles and shimmers when I move my head is amazing. They are a great length and I have not seen any color changes. I did try fogging up the ""gems"", and they do fog and quickly clear up. I cleaned jewelry before wearing and I was all good."
"I can‚Äôt explain how great the customer service has been while ordering from Cee & her shop. Firstly I ordered 4 hand gel keyrings (I‚Äôm a frontline worker) they come on time & very pretty - but recognition where it‚Äôs due, Cee also kindly gave a code for discount which she didn‚Äôt need to & also sent a free mask bag PERSONALISED too! My review would be far too long if I was to go into everything. But I‚Äôm absolutely overwhelmed by how kind this girl has been to give discount on items which were at a cheap price anyway & also send free personalised items too! The quality of both the hand gels & the mask bag were amazing... which is why I‚Äôve made other orders through Cee & her shop. I then ordered a diamant√© face mask which is amazing & so pretty - thick quality perfect for walking around in/out doors! I would highly recommend!! X"
"Bought 2 of these masks and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them!! They are well made and beautifully crafted. Did not take long to get them either! Super nice seller, too. I just had to buy 2 more :-). I totally recommend this shop. 100% + Thanks!"
"Absolutely love it , I get so many comments from strangers when I‚Äôm wearing it , I always tell them where it came from , thanks"
I am a bonafide skull lover-- So when I came upon this; there was no question that I not only wanted it--but NEEDED it!!! I am Absolutely POSITIVELY thrilled with this purchase-- The photos do not do it justice... More beautiful in person! Thank you‚ò†
Je les adore! Elles sont tr√®s belles!
"Magnifiques boucles d'oreilles re√ßues tr√®s rapidement, je vous remercie pour votre beau travail et ainsi que pour les petites attentions üòä"
"Article bien arriv√© , il est tr√®s sympa , bonne longueur √† mon poignet . Port√© tous les jours !!"
Bracelet tr√®s joli et discret! Je suis satisfaite de mon achat: livraison rapide et vendeuse tr√®s r√©active et agr√©able. Je recommande!

Such gorgeous earrings - really beautifully made and such pretty designs. Plus they came in pretty packaging with a cute note. Thanks Ohana!
I love this earring. I wear it pretty much constantly and it doesn't irritate my piercing at all. I'm glad it has two holes so you can choose the size based on your earlobe - I use the smaller size.
"Bellissimo, regolabile in altezza! Ottima qualit√†!"
"Dainty and elegant, and I love that you can wear it a few different ways! Seller was so nice to work with."
Super fast shipping and they are so cute!!!
"So happy with my purchase! I ended up changing my mind about my original order, and Ellie the shop owner was very helpful with helping me pick out earrings that would work for me. The earrings were perfect‚Äîdainty and cute and perfect for work, casual events, or even dressing up. She even included a sweet extra item. Everything came neatly packaged, and the shipping was so quick. I‚Äôm excited to wear the earrings. Thank you, NaiaJewelry!"
I‚Äôm super satisfied with my purchase! I got a bracelet and earrings and was pleasantly surprised with how fast the shipping was. The bracelet and earrings came in cute packaging and looked exactly like their photos! Would purchase from NAIA again!
Ordered the Camille open hoop earrings and they are absolutely gorgeous! I‚Äôm typically a traditional hoops gal and this pair added a great unique touch. It also came in cute packaging and arrived sooner than expected. Highly recommend!
Took a while to get the order but it is a lovely as it looks in the pics.
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are
"Absolutely stunning!! Ilona worked with me to create custom earrings and matching bracelet for my upcoming wedding, and I could not be happier with the final product! My blurry picture doesn't do it justice, but it's so sparkly and beautiful! Ilona is such a sweetheart and will totally make your day when you receive your jewelry in the mail :)"
Ilona did an AMAZING job! The earrings made my wedding look complete! Thank you SO much!
Love love love these! These are so beautiful and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day. Such a fun unique pair of earrings. The packaging was lovely too!
Amazing! Got for my wedding and everyone gushed over how beautiful they were.
"Jan's artistry and work are unmatched in both design and craftsmanship. I love both pairs of earring jackets she made for me, and one pair was custom designed to fit my 10mm gold ball earrings. I asked if she could make the jackets the way a pie crust's scalloped edges look and the result was exactly what I wanted! I truly am grateful for her personal care, time and expertise. I know I will be buying more of Jan's beautiful designs. Thank you, Jan."
"I gasped out loud when I opened the box and saw these absolutely gorgeous Argentium Silver jacket earrings for the first time. The swarovski studs are so beautiful. The quality was beyond my expectations!! I have favorited this shop, and have already decided on my next purchase. Than you so much, Jan Peyser! You are gifted. With much gratitude ~ Grace Haeusler"
"Beautiful earrings and excellent seller! I purchased earrings as a gift and ended up needing to exchange them. The person I purchased them for loved the style, however they were too long for her small face. So I contacted the seller to see about exchanging for another pair and she was excellent to work with. I sent back to original pair and had the replacement earrings back very quickly. Highly recommend working with Jan, she's wonderful and has beautiful jewelry!"
Beautifully made- they look expensive (especially for the price) and they shipped fast! Only thing is I wish they were one stone longer! But I‚Äôm a happy camper and will be ordering again.
Fast shipping and well packaged. I contacted the shop to ask for stones with more inclusions in the turquoise if they had it and they picked out a beautiful set that work great together. Super happy
"First earrings I‚Äôve owned like this‚ÄîI love them! The style, stone, and color are lovely. Hopeful for longevity."
So well made and absolutely adorable! The way the posts fit holds the earrings securely in place. I am very happy with this purchase.
Suited my wedding dress perfectly.
"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
Kathleen from Macalania has to be one of the kindest shop managers on all of Etsy! I had experienced shipping delays due to COVID which was not her fault at all and she made sure to send out a second pair of earrings so that they would arrive in time for a gift. She consistently tracked and updated my order to make sure I felt reassured the entire time. Her generosity and kindness went above and beyond! The earrings are GORGEOUS they are delicate and shined to perfection and I love so much that they are a gold and silver color which will allow me to match with all my other jewelry. They are amazingly minimal and make the perfect gift for all your designer friends!! I cannot thank her enough for this beautiful gift and I cannot wait to buy from this shop again! Thank you thank you ‚ú®‚ú® And they were shipped with extra backings!
Tr√®s jolies BO. J'aime leur √©l√©gance et la finesse du travail du fil d'argent. La livraison a √©t√© ultra rapide dans un emballage tr√®s s√©curis√© + un bel √©crin pour les prot√©ger. Merci √† sheilandi pour son professionnalisme.

"I found Haiku by chance, and loved all the designs. But finally I chose these earrings. The design is beautiful: organic and inspired by nature, just what I love! The gold plating is beautiful too: understated, and gives a glimpse of shine during movement. Fleeting and precious. I look forward to your new collection Haiku! :)"
"Tr√®s d√©licat et mignon, ce que j'ai imagin√© !!"
It's that I expected. I love it so much.
Here is one of the ear climbers I purchased in my photo. I love them so much! So different and beautiful thank you! Great customer service and quality product. I recommend highly.
Small and dainty. I love them! I was so tired of being stabbed by posts so I was looking for a non hoop earring. These are perfect. The seller even included a sweet hand written note explaining how to put them in because I chose the smallest option.
"These are gorgeous! I love the versatility of the earrings and how well they compliment my style. Also, I got a hand written note along with my order that really made my day. Thank you so much!"
"Absolutely stunning. Pure artistic masterpieces that I get to wear. I can‚Äôt praise these, and this maker enough!"
I'm absolutely in love with these earrings! So beautiful! I love everything savi jewelry has:) customer service is top notch!
VERY PRETTY EARRINGS-LOVE THEM-PERFECT FOR HOLIDAY!
Absolutely love these earrings! So dainty and comfortable to wear.

Merci encore
"I purchased these earrings to wear on my wedding day and was blown away by their delicate loveliness, detail, and craftsmanship. Even prettier than the pictures and extremely well-made! The package arrived in good time with a pretty little box and a personal note from the jeweler. Very pleased with my purchase and experience <3 THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
"I just got my earrings today and I love them!! Thank you very much Osnat, I am wearing them at my wedding they are perfect!! I will be looking through your stuff again and making another purchase!"
This item was as nice in person as it was in the picture. It came in a beautiful little gift box with a small silk rose attatched to her business card. Very creative packaging & a beautiful piece of jewelry. I would not hesitate to order from Osnat again. I was a little worried about the tracking & I notified Osnat & she responded that same day ( even though it was on a weekend & it was her day off).
International shipping took what felt like forever! (I blame customs.) But these earrings are well worth the wait! They are incredible! Very fun yet also super classy. They arrived beautifully packaged with obvious attention to detail and thoughtfulness. I highly recommend this shop for the gorgeous artistry of the products and fantastic customer service. I will likely become a return customer.
I can't say enough about this fabulous shop! Courtney was an absolute pleasure to work with and did an amazing job packing and shipping my purchase. My earrings arrived very quickly and were expertly packed using high quality materials. She even sent an unprompted note after shipment advising me on the best way to keep the earrings from pulling/drooping on my ears. I would shop here again in a heartbeat and have added MarhevCo to my favorites. I highly recommend Courtney and her shop for fine estate jewelry purchases. A+++ experience from start to finish!
"I think it did a ""road tour"" of the US for over 3 weeks before finally leaving that country & arriving in mine, much to my delight. Eye-catching ! The camera does not do it justice- throws sparkles of colour whenever the light catches it- & we have sooo much light over here! Thank you."
I bought a vintage engagement ring that needed to be resized. Courtney was incredibly helpful and had the ring resized and to me in record time (even during a pandemic). I absolutely recommend this shop to anyone looking for unique vintage jewelry
I kove this necklace. It's long as promised!!
"The ear cuff is exactly as you see it in the picture: good quality, solid silver and polished, and it came in a lovely ring box. Absolutely love it. Thank you Lucy!"
"Absolutely stunning!! Gorgeous!! Wonderful! Elegant!! Superb!! Fast, efficient and very friendly service. Best on Etsy!"
"Lovely quality ring, easy enough to manipulate to fit your finger perfectly. Great communication, quickly delivery and well packaged. Thank you!"
"Gorgeous! Fast, efficient and very friendly transaction. Best on Etsy."
Love these so much! They are so unique and cute! Took foreverrrrr for them to arrive because of mail delays and Covid but I finally got them!!
Soooooo beautiful. Don‚Äôt hesitate to order. Can‚Äôt wait to order other items!! Great quality and super cute and unique!
"I was so excited to get these in the mail and I tried them on as soon as I got them. Unfortunately, the posts bent out of shape immediately. Bc the overall shape of the earrings, you kinda need to finesse the backing on instead of sticking it straight in like I attempted to. I tried to straighten them out and they‚Äôre still wearable but still not completely straight. I‚Äôve never had this happen with any other earring before so I was disappointed, but otherwise they‚Äôre still very nice on and aren‚Äôt heavy. I wore them for a few hours and forgot they were there. Shipping was fine and I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get them anyway."
Really nice and they look beautiful on. My only tiny gripe is that the posts bend super easily - which I suppose is to be expected from sterling silver.
Absolutely beautiful. I couldn't be happier with these earrings
"Shipped right on time, great earrings!"
I love my hammered sterling silver amethyst earrings. So beautiful and they came with care instructions. Such a unique style for my birthstone. Best gift I gave myself this birthday.
"These are beautiful, just as shown in photo and lovely on. Thank you!"
Lovely earrings. My daughter has worn them every day sice Christmas! Would highly recomnend.
LOVE LOVE LOVE! so adorable!
"All of my order was just perfect- adorable designs, so well made, shipped fast, arrived quickly for international shipping, too! I love every single pair - A++++"
"I loved this. It is a bit big for my ear, but it is super gorgeous."
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
I am just in love. These have been on my favourites list for well over a year and I do ally bought them for my upcoming wedding! I wish I‚Äôd bought them sooner. They are absolutely stunning. Definitely an eye catching accessory and just like the picture. They arrived really quickly too! 5 stars all round!
Just stunning!!! I get compliments all day from my clients. üíñ
Perfect present for my bridesmaids! Loved the look of them xxx
None of the stores here including Macy's have anything this unique and attractive. They are extremely well made and light and comfortable to wear. Beautiful earrings made by a fine artisan. Would definitely buy from Yael again.
Gorgeous earrings! I purchased these for my wedding and am very happy with the quality and the craftsmanship. The communication process was also excellent. :)
"Beautiful, well made earrings! Very good communication from the seller - friendly and helpful."
I just love this pearl drop necklace. I had something similar when I was young and it was lost. I finally found on your website.
I love my new earrings! The size is perfect and they are not heavy at all. Pure silver! No problems with the delivery. I am extremely happy with this purchase :)

I love these buttons! They will make fantastic eyes for a future project. The seller was super helpful and a good communicator. And the buttons arrived very quickly for an international shipment. Thank you!
"Beautiful. Shipped within 24 hours. Gift. My sister opened box and a rosary was inside. I didn‚Äôt order a rosary. Our mother died last August. She said the rosary (devout Catholic ) My sister believes (who am I argue) that somehow it was a birthday gift from our Mom to her. Lovely, unexpected gesture. Couldn‚Äôt be happier. Definitely shop from this vendor again."
"Merci, les boucles ont beaucoup plu et je vous remercie aussi du joli emballage, simple et d√©licat. Cordialement"
Parfait! J'avais d√©j√† 2 de ces photophores dont un s'est cass√©. Je l'ai retrouv√© sur cette boutique (nulle part ailleurs). Parfait! Exactement le m√™me! Conforme √† la photo. Re√ßu en parfait √©tat. Bien emball√©. Et r√©ception ultra rapide 2 ou 3 jours apr√®s ma confirmation de commande. Donc rien √† dire tout √©tait parfait!
Super dainty and pretty! I love them!
ADORABLE!! Love the earrings and shipped quickly!
Seller is super responsive. The gift recipient loved the items!
"Beautiful earrings, I love the delicate design!"
So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
"I bought these for my elopement wedding and I could not be more impressed! They are stunning in size and quality. The ship time was super quick even from Israel to DC in a pandemic. Thank you so much, you made me feel like a princess on my special day."
This piece of jewelry is so beautiful. Looks exactly like the picture... I cannot wait to wear it on my wedding day with its matching pieces. My fianc√© has a deep emerald suit for the wedding and this will be the perfect touch for me.
Exceeded expectations and fast shipping!
Exactly as pictured. It's beautiful!
"Beautiful earrings, thank you so much!!"
I love these ear crawlers. Fast shipping. Will definitely be shopping again.
"This is the coolest! I think the post is a little thicker than a conventional earring, because I have some trouble getting it in, but besides that I think these are fabulous. I got the climber in addition to a single star stud, and both earrings are well made, sturdy, and super light weight - I actually forget that I'm wearing them sometimes. They also come in the cutest little jar, which I'm saving to store them in. And Arajera also sends along a little thank you card with care instructions on it, which I really appreciate. Super pleased with my purchase! Thank you. :)"
"I love these earrings! They were a bit hard to get in the first day because I hadn't worn earrings in a few weeks and my holes had tightened up, and these are sliiightly thicker than my normal posts. I just wore my heaviest dangles for a few hours to stretch the holes a bit and the next day they went right in like a dream! They look so cute, I've wanted a pair of these for years so I'm so glad I finally got them!"
"The quality of the product is great! Just a couple of notes, though: I ordered it at the end of November and I received it in early January. (I live in the U.S.) I should have looked at the shipping details more closely- if you're ordering from the U.S, do prepare to wait a while. Also, I had previously stretched my ears; they've closed up now, but if you have larger piercing holes, prepare for this earring to jut out a bit when you wear it. Still looks nice, not too noticeable! Ara does great work. :)"
"Beautiful ear climber! Ordered the earring to wear on my left ear and it didn't fit quite how I wanted, but that's honestly because my ear lobes are very small. I tried it on my right ear, upside down, instead and it fits perfectly! Wonderful craftsmanship and packaging :)"
"The ear cuff is exactly as you see it in the picture: good quality, solid silver and polished, and it came in a lovely ring box. Absolutely love it. Thank you Lucy!"
"Absolutely stunning!! Gorgeous!! Wonderful! Elegant!! Superb!! Fast, efficient and very friendly service. Best on Etsy!"
"Lovely quality ring, easy enough to manipulate to fit your finger perfectly. Great communication, quickly delivery and well packaged. Thank you!"
"Gorgeous! Fast, efficient and very friendly transaction. Best on Etsy."
"I LOVE these earrings! I got them in gold because sterling silver irritates my skin and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. They also shipped way faster than the estimated date, so that was a bonus. Will definitely be buying again from Kolera! So many cute quality pieces for a very reasonable price."
"I received my necklaces, anklets and earrings and I must say they are high quality pieces that I can wear every day and will for a long time! Michelle is such a lovely seller. She was so patient and understanding with all of my questions. This was my first purchase and will not be my last! I look forward to adding more Kolera jewellery to my collection!"
"I purchased the octagon locket with 24‚Äù chain for my mother‚Äôs 65th birthday. She absolutely loved it! Gorgeous, modern, timeless and hand crafted beautifully. Has the 925 stamp. The chains length can also be adjusted without tools by hooking it on one of the chain loops and letting the rest of the chain dangle at the back. Handy if you‚Äôre unsure of what length to get. Michelle went above and beyond when I had questions. Wonderful woman to work with. Shipped fairly quickly. I highly recommend her shop!! :)"
These hoops earrings are perfect. They're exactly the thickness that I wanted. I am so pleased!
"Very cool earrings. I‚Äôve been eyeing them forever, and finally bought them. They‚Äôre a little bigger on my ears than I expected, but they‚Äôre cute."
"This is my second purchase from this shop and just like the first time, I am very satisfied. The earrings are true to the pictures and comfy to wear!"
Elles sont magnifiques! Tr√®s bonne communication et r√©activit√© de la part de la vendeuse suite √† un probl√®me de livraison. N'h√©sitez pas √† commander dans cette boutique. Merci Kalypso.
I love my earrings. I have ordered from this store before and I have never been disappointed.
I love my new earrings! The size is perfect and they are not heavy at all. Pure silver! No problems with the delivery. I am extremely happy with this purchase :)
So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
"I bought these for my elopement wedding and I could not be more impressed! They are stunning in size and quality. The ship time was super quick even from Israel to DC in a pandemic. Thank you so much, you made me feel like a princess on my special day."
This piece of jewelry is so beautiful. Looks exactly like the picture... I cannot wait to wear it on my wedding day with its matching pieces. My fianc√© has a deep emerald suit for the wedding and this will be the perfect touch for me.
I love these earrings. They're for my wedding; I feel like royalty wearing them and I know none of my friends have seen anything like them! They're great quality too. I tried to take a picture of how magnificent they are on but I could not do them justice. You will not be disappointed with the service and quality if you buy from here!
Turned out absolutely beautiful! I wore them on my wedding day and they were perfect with my dress! Definitely would recommend this shop!
Gorgeous earrings!
Beautifull thanks! Illona is great
"Love these minimalistic designed ear climbers. I purchased my first pair a year ago and have received many compliments on them. They are easy to get on and off and are perfect for an active lifestyle. I lost one and was able to purchase a replacement for the side I lost instead of a whole new pair which was really nice. While I was at it, I ordered a gold pair and am in love with those too!"
Very comfortable! i wanted something understated and unique and these definitely deliver! i will probably get a gold pair as well.
Beautiful!A little snug but very pretty!
Love them
Super dainty and pretty! I love them!
ADORABLE!! Love the earrings and shipped quickly!
Seller is super responsive. The gift recipient loved the items!
"Beautiful earrings, I love the delicate design!"
"I've just discovered ear crawlers and I'm a little bit obsessed. This was even more beautiful and delicate in person and I was delighted when I opened the package. I love, love, love it!"
I‚Äôve wanted a set of ear climbers forever! So happy I found these are adorable.
"The posts are a little thicker than I am used to but after some maneuvering I was able to get them in :) lovely earrings, fast shipping. They really are so pretty."
"These ear climbers are beautiful and the quality is excellent, just as they seem in the picutres. I got the set and love how they look! The ear that I can use my dominant hand for always looks great, and the other ear is a struggle to get on correctly and have it stay. The back part of this climber is also a bit longer than the other one - not sure if that has an effect. I'm hoping my husband's help will make that go smoother!"
17-year old great niece loved them! Her first pair of climbers.
"My new favorite climber earrings! Unique, comfortable to wear, and perfect size. Great quality, not flimsy where you are afraid the will easily break!!"
Absolutely delighted with these . So well made. Quick delivery and messages answered . Will definitely use you again.
It's exactly what she wanted. Just like the picture. Thank you.
"Super beau, je suis trop contente !!!! Merci"
"Honteux ! Nous venons de recevoir deux masques, nous sommes un homme et une femme, les masques sont d√©fectueux et ne vont √† personne! Les √©lastiques sont trop loin et trop courts par rapport aux oreilles. Ils tirent les oreilles √† fond et ensuite tombent. Ils sont importables ! Apr√®s 10 jours d'attente d'exp√©dition on ne peut pas √™tre plus d√©√ßus. Les masques trouv√©s en commerce √† 4‚Ç¨ nous vont parfaitement donc il y a clairement un probl√®me..."
"Vendeur s√©rieux, beaux tissus Commande re√ßu en temps et en heure. Masques Conformes √† la description. J‚Äôai pris des masques pour toute ma famille et je ne suis pas d√©√ßu ! Je recommande HINEMESS Galerie ! Serious seller. Super masks , I recommend HINEMESS Galerie !"

I was surprised with this extender chain. It is very pretty and the color matches several of my shorter necklaces but I didn't realize how big 5mm is. We were never taught metric so I just breeze thru never knowing how long or wide things really are. I probably need 3mm or 4mm at the most but I did find a necklace that I can use it with so I am glad I found this. It is very sturdy and I won't ever be afraid of losing a pendant with this on. Thank you.
"Arrived on time and with minimal packaging. It's a beautiful ear climber earring. Sits comfortably in the ear and is very eye catching, if you love unusual earrings these are a great choice. I'd recommend and would buy again."
"Surpassed my expectations in attractiveness, quality and design. It has a presence without being in-your-face. I ordered another as soon as I saw how fine it was because it has a special significance for me and I plan on wearing it often. The stylish presentation box and prompt shipping are appreciated and the seller was helpful as could be. Highly recommend."
Quality made extender. Heavy duty and I love the long length and color.
I wear these in my first love. They are beautiful and fall in exactly the right place. I bought a total of three sets of earrings from this seller (all pictured in my lobes). These are the perfect combination of sparkle and opal. I‚Äôve showered in them and worked out in them but they have no turned green. The backs fit securely and I never feel at risk of losing the earrings. I love these so much. I‚Äôll definitely purchase more from this seller.
"These are so dainty and sophisticated! They match my other earrings perfectly. I'm glad I shopped with Sami. Quick USPS delivery too! I got gold hoops from her shop too (pictured), they look lovely together :)"
"Exactly as pictured and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôve bought a few pairs off Etsy and they‚Äôre always way bigger than pictured and these are so pretty and they fit my ear perfectly. I have them in my second lobe piercing, pointed towards my arch and it looks so nice. I‚Äôll probably buy from the seller again."
"I ordered this item to put my second-hole piercings to use and loved these as soon as I saw them. I also started wearing rose gold jewelry recently like rings and necklaces so I wanted to add a little something extra to my everyday look (super casually styled gal here üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) over all, I love them and the quality of the rose gold itself is amazing just as well as the opal and jewels. 10/10 would recommend"
"Ces. BOucles d oreilles chic et sport √† la fois, bon fermoir. Et facile √† porter. On les oublie. En plus elles sont belles. Merci BellaChix boutique."
J'ai achet√© cette belle cha√Æne pour la f√™te de ma m√®re et elle est extr√™mement heureuse de son cadeau! Livraison rapide! Cliente satisfaite! :D
"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de la bonne qualit√© et de la grandeur de mon collier, fid√®le √† la description. Ajustable gr√¢ce √† l‚Äôattache, j‚Äôai pu le porter plus serr√© ou plus lousse. Livraison rapide, j‚Äôai re√ßu ma commande 2 jours apr√®s ma commande (excluant la fin de semaine). Merci Bella chix pour ce beau produit!üòåüíñ"
J'ai √©t√© impressionn√©e par la rapidit√© √† laquelle le coli est arriv√© et la qualit√© est superbe. L'image du produit est parfaitement repr√©sentative du produit r√©el. J'adore cet entreprise !!
"This ring is just what I hoped for! Excellent weight, well balanced, prompt response and delivery...the ring is shiny, well-made-no rough edges to it, it lies really nicely on the finger. I would highly recommend this seller to anyone!"
"I didn't quite like the first one I got, but the customer service was absolutely perfect and Emilie agreed to send me another ring which was very-very pretty. Thank you so much!"
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles aux d√©tails inspirants. L'effet est saisissant! Merci!
Mes boucles sont tellement parfaites ! Merci merci merci !!!
This is amazing! I found a similar ring on a solo road trip over a year ago abs I‚Äôve worn it every day since but it has rusted and damage. I searched everywhere for a similar ring and am so happy with this purchase! It looks better than the original and I love it! Added pictures to show the wear and tear of my first ring.
Absolutely beautiful!!!! I bought this for my ‚Äúsister‚Äù who I met 20 years ago when we both were stationed in Italy with the US Navy. Not any Italy charm would do for this milestone that we are celebrating. This one has the island of Sardinia where we had many of our adventures because we were stationed on a smaller island between Sardinia and Corsica called LaMaddalena. She is going to love this as much as I do!!!
"I am a size 7 and I got the size 4-8, but I recommend getting the larger size. But I love the ring it is so cute and was shipped very quickly!"
It's the second ring i bought- love it! I am sure it's not the last one i buy from you :) and thank you so much for a little present you added. I really appreciate it!
Magnifique
"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"
"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ma commande qui est arriv√©e dans un temps record ! De plus, Marjolaine est vraiment tr√®s gentille, elle avait joint un petit cadeau en plus, et l'article command√© √©tait emball√© √† la perfection. Je recommande vivement cette SUPER Boutique de notre si belle √ÆLE DE BEAUTE !!"
en ce moment je n ai pas de chance avec mes commandes ! je n ai pas re√ßu ce que j ai command√© ! pour ce faire pardonner j ai re√ßu un petit cadeau : petit tr√©s petit .... √ßa m a fait sourire ; mais je ne suis pas fach√©e et cela ne m emp√®che pas de faire mes modestes cr√©ations Merci √† tous sinc√®res sympathie .... Anne Marie
These are amazing!! Haha So pretty!!<3 I got them for my sister for Christmas and she's going to love them!! Great service!! <3 :)
My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead- instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.
"It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that‚Äôs to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!"
"It is well made! I was hoping to wear them daily but they are uncomfortable to sleep in. I did also recently get my 2nd and 3rd piercing so that may be why. I have smaller ears so they are big and the flattened edge isn't super visible, in general with their size it is not a very noticeable feature to start. I started putting backs on while I sleep because they were coming out of my 3rd hole and I was nervous they would close up. They did come pretty quick though I was nervous about shipping they shipped fast and very super communicative."
los pendientes que he comprado son hermosos!!
Original and elegant! Thank you!
"Love these! I had messaged the seller, and I received a quick and concise answer. They shipped a day later than expected, but from being shipped from Greece to the United States, it arrived almost a week before expected. The quality is amazing. They fit the ear perfectly. They aren't too loose, nor too tight. They curve the ear just right. They color is beautiful. I received compliments on them the first day that I wore them."
love these earrings so different very happy
Thanks so much

"New favorite earrings! My grandmother gifted me with ear crawlers/climbers as a graduation gift a few years ago and I‚Äôve been obsessed with them but I could never find an everyday pair and have been searching ever since. When I bought this pair, I was so overjoyed. And I was so surprise with how fast it shipped. Even though I just got them, I am OBSESSED! I love them so much already. Also, I have a difficult time shopping for earring since my ears are very sensitive, but these don‚Äôt irritate my skin at all."
"I‚Äôve seen these and wanted them for so long finally purchased them and there even more perfect in person , I‚Äôm still trying to figure out the climber part but I love love love them so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Perfection!
"These earrings are amazing!!!Lightweight and so comfortable to wear. Maggie was wonderful to work with. I was worried about the COVID-19/holiday shipping delays, and she was personable, professional, and helpful. I will definitely shop here again!"
"Los pendientes son preciosos y est√°n perfectamente acabados. Vienen en una caja muy cuidada y la presentaci√≥n es muy bonita. Totalmente recomendables para regalar, como ha sido mi caso :)"
When I opened the package 4 these unicorn earrings I was blown away! More than I expected w/such detail. The gemstone is bright & beautiful! The pic doesn't do it justice. I'd definitely buy more & recommend my friends & family 2 buy here.
"Je suis enchant√©e de mon achat. Il s'agit d'un cadeau pour ma fille, elles va les adorer. Je reviendrais vers votre boutique pour son anniversaire :)"
"Ces boucles d'oreille sont tr√®s originales et jolies. Merci beaucoup pour la rapidit√© de l'envoi , pour le colis soigneusement emball√© et pour le cadeau de bienvenue. Cette boutique est tr√®s s√©rieuse et professionnelle, elle est √† recommander."
I haven't taken them off since I got them. Birthstone kitties. I think they are simply beautiful.
"schmuck gef√§llt mir sehr gut, p√ºnktliche lieferung"
It‚Äôs absolutely stunning! Exactly as pictured and just perfect! Also really fast shipping.

"Shipment never arrived! Seller blamed delays in shipping companies, and never provided a tracking number! Seller then ignored me and months later still no response! DANGER !!!!! DO NOT BUY !!!!! THIEF !!!!!"
"Comes beautifully presented in a little box. Love the colour of my opals within the earrings. Really pleased, fit nicely and stay well in place."
"I requested a custom item, and was met with kindness, quick responses, and it turned out perfect!!"
"The earrings looks even more stunning in person! So beautiful, can‚Äôt wait to where them for my wedding. Earrings were packaged beautifully."
These are too gorgeous and they were well packaged. Definitely recommend anyone on the fence if they are worth it. Can't wait to wear on my wedding day!
They are beautiful and it will help make my daughters wedding so much more
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
"so the best packaging award goes here! very nice, if it was gift, they would be impressed"
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"
"I was so excited to get these in the mail and I tried them on as soon as I got them. Unfortunately, the posts bent out of shape immediately. Bc the overall shape of the earrings, you kinda need to finesse the backing on instead of sticking it straight in like I attempted to. I tried to straighten them out and they‚Äôre still wearable but still not completely straight. I‚Äôve never had this happen with any other earring before so I was disappointed, but otherwise they‚Äôre still very nice on and aren‚Äôt heavy. I wore them for a few hours and forgot they were there. Shipping was fine and I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get them anyway."
"Los pendientes son preciosos y est√°n perfectamente acabados. Vienen en una caja muy cuidada y la presentaci√≥n es muy bonita. Totalmente recomendables para regalar, como ha sido mi caso :)"
"Heel mooie oorhangers, mooi afgewerkt; Heel vlugge en correcte levering. Verkoper aan te bevelen !"
"Je suis ravie, j'aime beaucoup ce type d'agate givr√©e dans ces tons de ""pierre"", et la pr√©sentation en brin de perles est vraiment avantageuse. Jusqu'√† maintenant je n'avais trouv√© des lots que de 4 √† 10 perles, cette boutique est parfaite pour les amatrices de perles naturelles."
My pendant is totally adorable!! I wear it with most of my outfits. Thank you for the quick delivery.
"Superbe pendentif, je l'adore ! L'envoi est soign√© et rapide, que du bonheur ! Je recommande vivement cette boutique !!!"
the seller was helpful with the shipping notification and the earrings are just stunning really high quality
Unique earrings and excellent customer service. Thanks so much!
I just love my new earrings! I get so many compliments when I wear them. Will definitely be ordering from this shop again!
It‚Äôs absolutely stunning! Exactly as pictured and just perfect! Also really fast shipping.

I had a small issue with my order and Lori was super helpful and responded quickly. Wonderful customer service and love the earrings.
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
They look so beautiful! I love them. I'm so glad I got them! I'm in love üòç
These earrings are absolutely adorable!!! I loved them and instantly put them in. I have not bought any earrings that climb your ear so I was nervous but they look great!!!
"i had a custom order. she and i talked a lot about what i wanted and she even took pics of everything so i could see before she sent it to me. she did everything perfectly. i am a happy camper to say the least. she is FANTASTIC. don't be afraid to ask for custom work, you can get anything that the artist can provide within reason..it works."
"Alors comment dire... J'ai flash√© sur ce sautoir ! Malheureusement √† la r√©ception je l'ai trouv√© bien trop court. J'ai longuement r√©fl√©chi, c'√©tait ma premi√®re commande chez Julie. Est-ce que je vais l'ennuyer avec mes probl√®mes de centim√®tres ou pas ? Je le conserve comme √ßa mais je ne le mettrai pas ? Et j'ai tent√© le coup ! Et Julie a r√©pondu √† toutes mes attentes. Elle m'a rallong√© la ""b√™te"" (c'est le nom d√©sormais de mon sautoir) et il est magnifique, pil poil ce que j'attendais. D'ailleurs je le porte aujourd'hui ! Alors mille mercis Julie, et conseil √† toutes vos futures clientes : allez y les yeux ferm√©s !"
"Colis re√ßu avec beaucoup de retard (3 semaines au lieu des 1 √† 3 jours ouvr√©s annonc√©s) et surtout aucune r√©ponse √† mes mails demandant des nouvelles. Lorsqu'enfin je re√ßois mon colis, j'ai enfin droit √† un semblant d'explications, mais apr√®s avoir pass√© 3 semaines sans aucune nouvelles, c'est un peu tard √† mon gout. Cerise sur le g√¢teau, j'ai d√ª recoller l'anneau qui s'√©tait dessoud√© du cabochon de la bague... ""envoi rapide et soign√©"" : PAS CONVAINCANT DU TOUT!!!"
this was a custom piece too and it came out just right too! she is just a true artist. i love her work. if you want something special try Julie's work .she will not disappoint.
"Absolutely gorgeous earrings, received compliments about them all night! Also, the customer service was fantastic, Ellie was an absolute dream and I received the earrings in a matter of days - couldn't ask for better."
Brilliantly made came as photographed lovely packaging made a great present
"Beautiful unusual earrings, exactly as in the photo. Thank you."
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©"
Such a beautiful piece that compliments so many earring styles. Thank you so much for your attention to detail. The packaging and personal note was lovely. Thanks again.
"Everything from blueandblue is gorgeous! You can tell that every piece is made with such care and precision. This is the best shop I've found for earring jackets like these. If you have any questions, the shop owner responds quickly and kindly! :) I also love the presentation and design of the packaging the jewelry comes in ‚Äî so cute and thoughtful!"
Amazing! I could not be happier with this one.
Love these earrings!! Very well made and will be gorgeous for a special occasions coming up. Fast shipping. Could not be happier! Thanks!!
I love this ring! Thank you for customizing. Great service.
"Amazing ring, perfect size, fast delivery :)"
Good quality and fast shipping !
"Beautiful ring, great color on the stone, nice patina on the metal! Adjustable a little without looking ""adjustable"" and artisan went the extra mile to get it to me after some weird mailing SNAFU. Thanks!"

"Commande re√ßue d√®s le 18 novembre 2020 ! Pour du sur- mesure, c'est vraiment rapide et pr√©sent√© avec go√ªt. Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de cette premi√®re commande: ces boucles d'oreilles cuir rouge/argent sont uniques et c'est ce qui fait leur charme. Je vais repasser une commande, mais pour un cadeau cette fois-ci: No√´l approche ... Merci beaucoup et √† tr√®s bient√¥t, Catherine"

"I asked a few questions and the shop owner helped me very very quickly, I'm in love with my new stone earrings! the are extremely well done!"
"This review is mainly regarding the seller: The item took a long time to arrive to Canada, but the seller has recently changed to a new shipping company which I imagine should help. Despite the item taking a long time, I believe that Canada Post was mostly at fault and it was lost in their facilities for a while. The seller was responsive and issued a refund before Canada Post finally delivered my item. I appreciate her customer service and I paid her back for the refund. Which she then refunded the difference so my payment ended up being the same as my original discounted price. Item review: My wife seems to really love it and it was well packaged."
Son unes arracades molt maques. Discretes i bufones.
The earrings are super cute! love the style.
"I absolutely love my my ear cuff. It fits snugly and I don‚Äôt have to worry about it falling off. It‚Äôs so comfortable I actually went to sleep with it on not realizing I had been wearing it until the next morning. The shipping and delivery service was prompt. If you‚Äôre looking for a non-piercing ear cuff, look no further. This is the best quality ear cuff I have purchased."
Exactly as pictured and look great with my stud earrings. Shipped quickly.

I purchased these darling earrings for my daughter and she loves them and has gotten a lot of compliments too.
Perfect fit couldn‚Äôt be happier üëèüëçüòÅ Thank you
"I purchased these for my sister in rose gold, and she loved them! They are well made and just as described. My sister has her ears double pierced, so wears them in her second hole, with statement earring in her first piercing. They look awesome and now I want a pair! :) I would definitely recommend these!"
"Wish I could give the customer service more than five stars!.. she was so helpful and so kind!üòä Although I had a slight problem with the earrings at first, she was kind so and willing to do all that she could to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I wear these earrings EVERY day! They‚Äôre so so cute. ü•∞"
"Los pendientes son preciosos y est√°n perfectamente acabados. Vienen en una caja muy cuidada y la presentaci√≥n es muy bonita. Totalmente recomendables para regalar, como ha sido mi caso :)"
"Wow are these gorgeous! I‚Äôm a minimalist and picky about what goes into my closet. I‚Äôve searched for a few years and finally found the perfect piece. They‚Äôre light, well-crafted, extremely stylish. Very happy customer!"
"it`s love. :o) my expectations were already high, just unpacked them and they are even prettier than I could imagine. Thank you, Meytal!!"
Beautiful ring! I am absolutely in love. It took over three weeks to get here though... That was a bit of a bummer. But the Ring made more than up for it.
Just as pictured--beautiful! Love them and have gotten so many compliments. Thank you <3
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"The earrings are exactly what I wanted. I needed amethyst ones which the seller was able to accommodate. I would 100% recommend jewelry from this seller. The earrings are beautiful, and I was also able to use the studs for my engagement pictures."
"These earrings arrived quickly, were packaged well, and are beautiful. The craftsmanship is excellent and they look/feel heavy without feeling heavy on my ears. I love the little ‚Äúclip‚Äù at the top to ensure they stay in place. They are exactly what I was looking for and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them...they will be showstoppers. Can‚Äôt wait to order more from Rebeka Jewelry."
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
Very dainty but beautiful! Well made and so comfortable to wear. Perfect for everyday! Thank you!
"These are amazing! The quality is excellent and they are so dainty while still being eye catching. Shipping was prompt, they actually arrived two weeks sooner than expected! I am so happy with these, they are perfect for my wedding day, thank you!!"
dainty & beautiful! Loved them
"Very dainty rose gold earrings. Easy to put in and looking forward to wearing them ongoing! They are definetly thinner than I thought they would be, but still pretty"
It is my first time shopping on Etsy and I am surprised by the good quality. It looks so pretty on my ears. It is not bulky and so comfortable. It goes so well with my floral print dress. I definitely recommend it to my friends! Absolutely love it!!!
Every piece of jewelry I‚Äôve gotten from them has been so beautiful! I can‚Äôt wait to see what else this shop will release. Shipping was within the expected time frame and no damage to any products when they arrived. Everything came just like what is shown in the pictures!
"I am happy with the pin I got from them. the quality is great, not too shiny nor dull, and most importantly it fits very well with my ear. They surely adds charm to the person who wears it. As I was afraid that the pin does not match my ear size, I dropped them a message and they responded very fast and provided quality follow-up. Nice Job!"
It is absolutely gorgeous! It's super comfy and not heavy at all. It shines beautifully in the light and are hands down my new favourite earrings!
Exceeded expectations and fast shipping!
Exactly as pictured. It's beautiful!
"Beautiful earrings, thank you so much!!"
I love these ear crawlers. Fast shipping. Will definitely be shopping again.
I love these earrings! They go with everything!
"Got these as a present, they loved them however they were a worried when adjusting them as the wire is a bit thin."
"Great quality, fast delivery and it came in a cute gift bag!"
"I got these as a birthday present for a friend and she absolutely loves them. The customer service was amazing. When I first ordered them they sadly never arrived but when I contacted the seller she was so helpful and sent another pair on recorded delivery. My friend was so happy when she did get them. I highly recommend buying from this seller, you'll be in good hands!"
"Really dainty and elegant, really love these! My first ever pair of earrings! Shipped quickly and arrived before expected date."
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
"Bonjour, Je viens de recevoir les boucles d'oreilles! Je suis ravie et h√¢te de les porter...Ma soeur va s√ªrement me les piquer aussi üòä‚ù§"
"Boucles d'oreilles jolies, tr√®s originales, et que je n'ai pas trouv√© ailleurs. J'ach√®te toujours chez Kasolya les yeux ferm√©es, je ne suis jamais d√©√ßue."
"Sympa mais comme c'est un produit unique et fait main, le tissu ne rend pas comme sur la photo : sur les 2 paires achet√©es (une pour offrir) il y a plus de rose, peu de couleur claire contrastante et pas de violet, √ßa fait moins wax et √ßa flashe moins mais tant pis, merci pour la rapidit√©"
"The earrings are exactly as described and more lovely than I imagined. They appear in excellent condition given their age. I was a bit worried about overseas shipping, but the item was delivered only fours days after the order was confirmed. Thank you for great customer service!"
Love it! It's gorgeous and very fair price! Thanks so much!
Thank you so much Lydia for my beautiful French Art Deco ring that arrived safely today. You have been a pleasure to deal with and I highly recommend your excellent service to anyone wishing to buy a special piece of jewellery.
Such a gorgeous piece. Perfect seller ÔºÅÔºÅ Great communication the whole way through. Item arrived promptly and exactly .Would 100% recommend this seller.
"I love these earrings! They are so beautifully made and the detail work is amazing!! I do have to get used to them because I'm not used to earrings like this but I'll manage. They came a lot sooner than I expected. I was worried about it being shipped to California but there were no problems and I'm happy they came. I especially like the customer service. The seller was so nice, professional, and very helpful in answering my questions. Overall, I had a great experience. Thank you so much!!üòä"
"I am very happy with my purchase. It came in time as I requested and it was beautiful-very delicate and unique. My friend, who received it as a gift, loved it. This necklace looks and feels as a very special piece of jewelry. I would definitely order from this Company again."
Very fast delivery and absolute perfectly done. I love my new necklace. The bat is my power animal <3
"Love,love,love these earrings. They are so unique and comfortable. I always get compliments when I wear them. They arrived is a short time too!"
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
"Love this ring so much, and thankful for the speedy shipping and kind note as well!"
"arrived quickly , lovely watch"
Service was phenomenal they did a great job with gift wrapping and the jewelry box was beautiful ü•∞üåπ
This piece is stunning and so perfect. The chain is dainty and small which goes well with the gem. The moonstone gleams blue in the light & radiates positive energy. The picture doesn‚Äôt even do it justice. Its beautiful in person. I am so happy with this purchase.
"Bonjour, j'ai re√ßu le bijou tel qu'il est en photo, dans une tr√®s jolie boite ton rouge tr√®s originale!!! Je n'ai rien de plus a rajouter , tout s'est pass√© correctement , et j'esp√®re que ce cadeau plaira √† ma fille (j'en suis sure!) , nous aimons toutes deux les pierres. Merci et √† bientot , peut etre ,,,,?????"
"The bracelet was sized perfectly and is very comfortable to wear. I also could feel the energy of the stones when I put it on. I've seen a lot of this type of bracelet for sale, but I don't think any are of the quality that this seller offers. She has a wonderful eye for detail, and everything is very well made. Highly recommended!"
Beautiful Mushroom Rhyolite pendant. Well packaged and shipped safely via registered mail. It‚Äôs well worth the wait because registered mail really takes long (and because of the pandemic took longer) even if the seller was mindful to ship the very next day after I bought it. Thank you!!
Superbe boucles ! Tr√®s compl√®te car on ne voit que cela. Donne 1 effet particuli√®rement exceptionnel. Je les porte quotidiennement car elle m'ouvre le visage et l esprit. Beau travail et soign√© et re√ßu avant la date. Merci
It is even more beautiful in person. The pendant with writing wasn‚Äôt attached due to the jump ring not being fully closed so I placed it back on the chain and closed the jump ring (I have jewelry tools). I am in love with this piece!!
Great customer service (friendly and helpful) and prompt dispatch. The earrings are lovely and I‚Äôm delighted with them. Will definitely order again from this shop!
These earrings are just gorgeous - beautifully made and so pretty - fast shipping too - thank you again!
Not the cheapest on Etsy but so worth the money. It‚Äôs sterling silver and the birthstone is a wonderful deep colour. These charms are tiny perfect to accompany a pendent and beautifully well made. The seller was so helpful making sure I got just what I wanted and the delivers was so fast I can‚Äôt fault and I will return for more
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreille ! Merci beaucoup !
"Love, love, love these earrings! Very unique and like that they are light weight."
"les boucles d'oreilles sont tr√®s belles, tout √† fait assorties au pendentif et sont parfaitement conformes √† ma demande merci d'avoir pu les r√©aliser selon mes souhaits bien √† vous"
"Plus jolie en vrai, j'adore, re√ßu tr√®s rapidement, je conseille Stonanka"
"Love, love, love these earings! Many complements already and will wear them daily, fast shipping and wonderful service. Great expereince buying from overseas."
"I literally love these. Kathy custom made mine as my ear is rather small, and it's perfect. xx"
"J‚Äôadore <3 bons contacts avec la vendeuse, et bijoux magnifiques !"
i love my earrings and kathy is very sweetüíï
"I purchased the clip on version in silver thinking that if I purchased it in the pierced version, it might be a little heavy - but it's not. Very lightweight, great quality, nice shine to it. The clip is invisible so it looks like it was pierced through like a post. I like it so much I'm getting the pierced version in silver and gold (since I know it won't drag the hole of my ear down) and giving the clip on to a friend because she wants to start wearing earrings. I know she'll love this! Shipping was 5 business days and it was carefully wrapped and pretty."
"These earrings are so beautiful! Pictures don't do it justice! The clip on is truly invisible! I haven't worn them for an extended amount of time, so I can't speak to comfortability, but when I tried them on I was amazed at how I couldn't feel them"
"I loved this necklace , the heart with wings pendant was so cute and dainty, just what i wanted to remember my passed baby but after a day of wearing it , the chain broke and I didn‚Äôt realize it and had to hunt down my necklace this morning."
This necklace is simple but beautiful! I wore it when I got engaged!
"so the best packaging award goes here! very nice, if it was gift, they would be impressed"
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"
"I was so excited to get these in the mail and I tried them on as soon as I got them. Unfortunately, the posts bent out of shape immediately. Bc the overall shape of the earrings, you kinda need to finesse the backing on instead of sticking it straight in like I attempted to. I tried to straighten them out and they‚Äôre still wearable but still not completely straight. I‚Äôve never had this happen with any other earring before so I was disappointed, but otherwise they‚Äôre still very nice on and aren‚Äôt heavy. I wore them for a few hours and forgot they were there. Shipping was fine and I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get them anyway."
Took a while to get the order but it is a lovely as it looks in the pics.
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are
"Beautiful earrings, faster than expected shipping to US from France. Seller is lovely. Thank you ü§ç"
Envoi rapide et soign√©. Les boucles sont superbes. Encore plus en vrai qu'en photo. Je ferais d'autres commandes sans h√©sitation.

"The only surprise is that they are very flat/thin. I expected them to have more substance, but overall very pretty earrings."
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."
Gorgeous earrings and they look exactly like the photos. I was worried that my ear lobes would be too small but they fit perfectly. Thank you!
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. It‚Äôs such a dainty ring and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it.
Beautiful earrings as pictured. I do have a slight allergy to certain metals so I can‚Äôt keep them in too long. This is not the seller‚Äôs fault. She did amazing work! Thank you!
Arrived on Time! Love them! The are just the right size and stay on securely.
Terrific earrings. I missed wearing earrings but I wanted a pair that wouldn‚Äôt get caught in the ear loops of my Covid masks. These are perfect.
"I absolutely love them! They fit so well, and haven't fallen out since I put them in"
"Very elegant and timeless! üïä These beautiful olive branch earrings are one of my most favorite earrings now, they look and feel so regal! The ornate and classical foliage design reminds me of ancient laurel leaves. I prefer wearing them as pictured, although they are stunning as ear climbers. Many thanks, Joanna!"
"I purchased the bright silver olive leaf ear climbers for my 12-year-old daughter and they are gorgeous. Very delicate and appropriate for a girl, and a nice alternative for someone who doesn't wear big dangly earrings. They are a little trickier to get in than posts but she was able to do it herself without too much trouble."
These climbers are perfect! I have been wearing them everyday since I received them and they look and feel amazing!
"So cute! I love the level of detail, they look great. Thanks so much!"
Re√ßue hier je suis ravie. Cette robe que je vais porter en tunique est superbe.Le tissu tr√®s beau et son col noue apporte beaucoup. De plus cela va me booster pour me mettre au r√©gime car j'avais pas pris conscience de ma prise de poids et suis serr√©e ( √©tait rest√©e avec mes anciennes mesures ) donc effet 2 fois positif !!! Merci
Love my bracelets I keep ordering more!
"Super contente, Rapide la livraison, les colliers sont magnifiques !!!"

The bracelet is Amazing. It is much more than I ever expected. I got it for myself for my Birthday. The shipping was also super fast!!!There are no disappointments here!!!! I recommend that everyone check out this vendor.
"A beautiful bracelet, well made. The crystal accent sets this apart from others that I have seen. Shipped fast. AAA+++"
"Love it!! The ring fits perfectly but can be adjusted as needed. Came in a cute bag, too. (Although it looks like it says ‚Äúwitn‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwith‚Äù?) Very happy with my purchase!"
this is a show stopper! and so comfortable. really nicely made. thank you. Lynda

"Comes beautifully presented in a little box. Love the colour of my opals within the earrings. Really pleased, fit nicely and stay well in place."
"I requested a custom item, and was met with kindness, quick responses, and it turned out perfect!!"
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
I had to switch these out for a different pair only because my ears are a bit smaller than average and it didn't sit right. Ilona to the rescue! She was so accommodating and allowed me to seamlessly exchange for a pair that perfectly compliment my headpiece and dress. Thank you soooo much!
"This ear climber is truly brilliant; the sparkle is superlative! Quality is sturdy, and it stays in place for hours without leaving my ear feeling sore as other cartilage clips and magnets have done. Shipping was fast and the earrings were spotless and nicely packaged; I'm so looking forward to wearing this climber to several upcoming occasions! Thank you Iloniti!"

Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.

"These earrings are absolutely fabulous. They look so great with my mustards, yellows, and blacks. A jeweler friend today was very impressed with the workmanship! I love this seller's work! Highly recommend! <3"
"I absolutely love these earrings! I‚Äôve worn them many days and they are fabulous! They hang so nice and are a real attention getter. The bead work is perfection! They arrived so quickly, too! I‚Äôve since bought more. This seller is wonderful!"
"fact that they are very contemporary but not heavy looking or feling, and I can easily customize each piece with the colors to match my outfits. The artist will send you all the colors of the beads for you to select just the right colors! she has numerous colors in each color category so you can get exactly the right colo9r to match. the sercie and communication is great. One of the best vendors I have worked with at Etsy!!!! I highly rec-commend this Artist. :-) Leslie Richards /Interior Designer, Naples, Florida"
"This is a FANTASTIC shop! The earrings are A very fine ,dainty quality.

"This is the most beautiful ring I have ever seen in my entire life and I find myself just staring at it throughout the day and smiling. As my nail tech was admiring it, I told him it wasn‚Äôt a diamond and he straight up thought I was lying. The way the stone is shaped makes it so radiant, especially when the sun hits it. It‚Äôs delicate yet strong and it was clearly made with care and attention to detail. The customer service was also exceptional, patiently answering my 842 questions and sending me pictures throughout the process of them making it to assuage my anxiety about making such a big purchase online. I am SO happy I ordered from this shop. My experience could not have been better."
"Beyond expectation! I ordered this ring to replace the real Diamond engagement ring for daily use. In a total of 84 messages, the customer assistant patiently answered each and every question I have. The ring was a customized order with very very specific request. I was extremely surprised that it was delivered in less than two weeks of time. I instantly fell in love with the ring after I opened it. Pictures and words can‚Äôt do the justice! Made exactly as what I requested. The attention to details and craftsmanship were absolutely amazing too! Thank you Keyzar for making my dream ring come true!"
"Words cannot express how excited I am about this ring!!! My husband and I are already married, but this is an early 5th year anniversary gift! I LOVE IT!!!! The team at Keyzar answered every single question I had and I had a lot! üòÖ They responded quickly and were so friendly. I was able to change a few things about the original ring to customize it for exactly what I wanted. This is a 14k yellow gold solitaire with a 2 carat/8mm moissanite stone. It's cut into hearts and arrows. üíò The band is 2mm wide. These pictures do NOT do this ring justice. It is GORGEOUS!! Shipping was fast! I can't stop staring at my hand! I love love love it sooo much. Thank you Keyzar!!"
"Gorgeous jewelry, like the photos but far better. Great and prompt communication from the seller. The processing time was faster than estimated and shipping from Israel to the DC area was about 3 days. The ring sparkles beautifully and you can easily get lost in the depths of the facets in the center stone. I went with a 3 ct stone instead of the 2.5 which I think was the perfect choice for my hand and the look I wanted. I chose 18kt gold, aka 750. 750 is the only stamp inside the band. I'm going to be distracted looking at this beauty for a long time. Because moissanite is so much lighter than a diamond the light weight is the only giveaway that this isn't a mined diamond, as many strangers passing by might assume. Would definitely purchase from this seller again."
"c'est magnifique ! boucles ultra l√©g√®res, agr√©ables √† porter et tellement gracieuses !"
Just loved this little cute tape. I got the orange background and it is vibrant and whimsical.
"Colis re√ßu tr√®s vite et tr√®s bien emball√©, je suis ravie ! Merci :)"
All the way from France!!
J'ai command√© ce bracelet pour la f√™te des m√®res pour ma m√®re qui habite dans une autre ville. L'emballage √©tait super mignon et le bracelet fait super bien :)
"Simple, pretty, easy. The clasp, similar to an electric light ceiling fixture NEVER comes undone. In fact, we need to remove it together. But she wears it always so that's not an issue. It is what the seller said it is and we love it."
"I like the style of the bracelets, but after less than two weeks of wear the plating is already coming off, soon I will have copper coloured stacked bracelets :("
Livraison rapide et tr√®s heureuse de mon achat! Je le porte tous les jours!
I realy like this bracelet the shop made .looks so light on my wrist i put my little tiny pendant on it .i going to do the same with the necklace i just ordered .yesterday.. Thanks so much .from the usa...... I love French stuff.
The seller is super sweet. I love the necklace as well. She does custom designs so I am going to come up with something special for my mom!
Necklace is very beautiful!!! Great quality! I got length 38 and it fits perfect! Love it!
"Conforme √† la description, simple, je ne sais pas si dans le temps c'est hyper solide car tr√®s fin, mais l'ai rang√© pr√©cieusement jusqu'au jour J... Livraison 2 jours tr√®s rapide. Merci"
Absolutely stunning! My new favorite set. These were custom made 14k gold plated over sterling for my sensitive ears. This shop is wonderful for accomodating requests/sensitivites. Highly recommend!
Absolutely stunning. I bought the snake ear climbers and I‚Äôm in love. Well made and they get tons of compliments.
I have tried for years to find an ear cuff I liked well enough to wear. Comfort was also a huge issue. I am a tall woman so I wear my jewelry.... it doesn‚Äôt wear me.... but some ear cuffs are more torture devices than jewelry. This lovely cuff sits comfortably on the ear & is easily forgotten until you glance in a mirror. It is magic! I am delighted! Think I have purchased somewhere around 15 pieces from your gallery of wonderful jewelry delights. I love them all! The Dragon Trio is my favorite! Keep creating‚ù§Ô∏è
"It,S absolutely beautiful, love wearing it. My stars sign is Aquarius and I got sick of old Neptune with a beard, so I started looking for a Mermaid, I am very pleased with this one."
Perfetta armonia tra magia ed incanto confezionato da mani speciali che fanni di questo oggetto la possibilit√† di avere un sogno tra le mani!!!!
Wearable art. I love it!!
I LOVE these earrings! So classy! The quality is top notch as well! I loved them so much I had to purchase another pair for my best friend! It‚Äôs just a shame that YOU don‚Äôt own a pair!!!
"De tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles, envoy√©es rapidement et accompagn√©es d'une tr√®s gentille attention : rien √† redire, hormis merci beaucoup ! :-)"
Je suis vraiment contente de ma commande. Les bijoux √©taient soigneusement emball√©s avec un jolie petit mot accompagn√© d‚Äôune offre et d‚Äôun cadeau. Les bijoux sont tr√®s jolie je suis ravie. Encore merci ! Je vous recommande cette boutique üå∏
"Tr√®s jolies cr√©oles, j'en suis tr√®s contente ! Leila est vraiment adorable et tr√®s r√©active !!"
Absolutely gorgeous in person! This is my second purchase and everything I have received has been beautifully made. I will definitely be back for more. Very happy!
I love them! They are absolutely beautiful and easy to put on. I‚Äôll definitely be back for more!
Love Love Love my new earrings. Little bugger than what I imagined they‚Äôd be but that makes them even better!!!!
"Love it! it kinda hurts my ears the way it‚Äôs shaped, so I only wear them b on the days I‚Äôm trying to be cool. The little irritating is well worth it."
Love these so much! They are so unique and cute! Took foreverrrrr for them to arrive because of mail delays and Covid but I finally got them!!
Soooooo beautiful. Don‚Äôt hesitate to order. Can‚Äôt wait to order other items!! Great quality and super cute and unique!
"I was so excited to get these in the mail and I tried them on as soon as I got them. Unfortunately, the posts bent out of shape immediately.

I wore them for a few hours and forgot they were there. Shipping was fine and I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get them anyway."
Really nice and they look beautiful on. My only tiny gripe is that the posts bend super easily - which I suppose is to be expected from sterling silver.
Great items. Love the fit! Thank you for your prompt service.
Very pretty earrings. I rewrapped this gift.

"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"

What a beautiful clock! It is even prettier in person. It arrived promptly and was meticulously packed. I am so impressed with this seller. I love my vintage Sessions clock. It keeps perfect time too. Wish the seller had another one.
"Possibly the fastest delivery I have ever had on Etsy! I was looking to add some 70's flair to a modern pair of shoes and the clips are perfect. I love them, and I'll probably wear the shoes more now. Thank you!"
"This is such an attractive & well made pin & even more impressive in person! It has a very intricate pattern with deep cut outs at the top edge. A very detailed & solid piece, I had thought of displaying it in a frame with other vintage pins, but it‚Äôs pretty enough to wear! Another quality piece from James & Scott‚Äôs store! It was also well wrapped & came in good time! üëçü•∞üíïüßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

Pretty silver wing ear climbers. Took some time to be delivered from Greece to Sydney Australia (understandably!). Easy to put on.
Simply beautiful! I get loads of compliments and I love the uniqueness of the ear climbers. Also super fast reply from the seller when I asked a question so that was great
"I had a similar, silver pair bought from a big chain store, but I don‚Äôt think I can ever wear them again after these! They‚Äôre so comfortable I completely forgot I was wearing them, and they‚Äôre stunningly light! They match all of my face piercings, too, which is a huge bonus!"
"Earrings are excellent! Package was so well wrapped it took 5 minutes to open, but was worth the care she took. The earrings are balanced not too heavy and will be a statement when I wear them. Thank you. MK"

"So happy with my purchase! I ended up changing my mind about my original order, and Ellie the shop owner was very helpful with helping me pick out earrings that would work for me. The earrings were perfect‚Äîdainty and cute and perfect for work, casual events, or even dressing up. She even included a sweet extra item. Everything came neatly packaged, and the shipping was so quick. I‚Äôm excited to wear the earrings. Thank you, NaiaJewelry!"
I‚Äôm super satisfied with my purchase! I got a bracelet and earrings and was pleasantly surprised with how fast the shipping was. The bracelet and earrings came in cute packaging and looked exactly like their photos! Would purchase from NAIA again!
Ordered the Camille open hoop earrings and they are absolutely gorgeous! I‚Äôm typically a traditional hoops gal and this pair added a great unique touch. It also came in cute packaging and arrived sooner than expected. Highly recommend!
Bought two pairs of those in size M and XL. Very good quality! Very happy with it and now buying in size L too :) On the photo is XL one.
"the ruby and pink gold ear cuff is really stunning! A little hard getting it in but, once it's in it stays there until you take it off ( which is easy ). Thank you for making such beautiful ear cuff. I have a third one on it's way to me now! Highly recommend!"
Perfect! I love them and the seller was amazing. I will be back! Worth the price and the wait! I will upload pics at a later time but I assure you they are beautiful.
Heel mooiü•∞
"Love the Earrings! Got lots of compliments! The only thing that is upsetting me about these are the backs are not tight at all.. they were the first few days and then they got really loose.. so I constantly have to make sure the backs are all the way on. But besides that, I love them!!üòç‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è"
These are beautiful & have great detail! Just as shown! High quality & not difficult to get on & off! I will definitely be buying more from this seller :)
Llegaron r√°pido y me encantan. Son iguales que los de la foto. He recibido muchos cumplidos :) Los volver√≠a a comprar. They came fast and I love them. They are the same as the photo. I have received many compliments :) I would buy them again.
Just perfect. Thank you so much
Sehr sehr sch√∂ne Ohrringe :)
Never received the item. Have asked for refund.
"I am sorry that you are not happy with your purchase. As we discussed,I shipped your order on March 28 and the parcel left Greece on March 29.Œ§he parcel is currently in New York. As the parcel is traveling from Greece to the US,delays may occur especially in busy periods such as Christmas and Easter Holidays.Unfortunately Postal Delays isn't something I can control. I put my heart into my work and it is important to me that everyone that orders from my shop is happy with the order. The parcel isn't lost and you will receive it the following days. If you are not happy with the item you received you can return it to me and I will proceed with a refund. For more information regarding return-refund policies please check my shop policies. I am at your disposal for anything you need."
"My fianc√© LOVES this ring. It fits her perfectly and matches with mine. It took a long time (2-3 weeks) for the ring to arrive, but we get to brag a bit cause it came from Greece. And that's pretty dang cool. However, reviews are often just about someone getting what they paid for or not, so I want to make sure you know that JENNY is awesome. She was quick in communicating with me how long it would take for the ring to arrive. I'd planned to propose to my fianc√© a few days after I ordered the ring, but Jenny made sure I knew it wouldn't arrive by then. So I got to propose with something better suited for the purpose (silicone, by the way, is the best kind of ring to propose with at the top of Angel's Landing). But we still got this ring because it is beautiful and affordable. Anyway, Jenny's great. Buy from her."
Love these earrings. They are expensive looking and beautifully made. I needed them for an event and the owner was willing to ship them out quickly so I got them in plenty of time. I will definitely shop with them again!
"El art√≠culo es precioso. Lleg√≥ con rapidez. Adem√°s fue acompa√±ado por un regalo de la tienda, un detalle por la compra. Me ha encantado. Muchas Gracias."
"I received my raw turquoise brooch exactly as it was described, it is beautiful. It is handmade and the workmanship is a very high quality and my expectations were very much met."
Absolutely love my ring! Exactly what I expected and goes perfectly with a bracelet I have. Thank you!
"Love, love, love these climbers. I get so many compliments! Super fast shipping, too."
I love my earring! I had one similar to this one and lost it. So glad I was able to find another. This one is much more comfortable than the one I had before from a different seller. This one I can‚Äôt even tell its there it is some light and comfortable!
I ALWAYS get compliments on these beautiful ear pins. Top rated quality and craftsmanship! Thank you!
Exactly as advertised! Simple and elegant. I wish they came a little smaller so it worked better as an every day earring for my second hole - so if you ever make a smaller one I‚Äôll buy it! These are lovely.
My girl LOVES her Daisy and daisies . . . so these gorgeous little daisy climbers look awesome in her ears!
"I love the earrings. From the photo I thought it had a post back but it has the loop. I looked at the description and it said loop so, my bad. I find the loop less secure so I'm a little nervous that I may loose one of them. They look great on and came in an adorable little box!"
"Very pretty, shipping was quick considering how far they came! Very nicely packaged as well. Thank you!"
These earrings are beautiful and and well made. Love them already!

"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE THESE EARRINGS! They are so gorgeous and well made! On a side note, I actually had an issue with my order when it first arrived, but upon contacting the seller they immediately sent my out a replacement and it's everything I could have hoped for! Seller is amazing and understandable, pieces are unique and incredible. I highly recommend this shop and will definitely be coming back myself."
Most beautiful earrings ever I get lots of compliments for them. The service was great and I'm looking forward to buying more in this shop.
"Gorgeous! The fit takes a little adjustment, but these look so unique and beautiful. Used in a photoshoot and they turned out amazing!"
This set is beautiful and is perfect! Good communication & it arrived really quick!

These earrings came faster than expected even though I ordered them on a busy weekend. Beautiful. Chi miigwech!
I ordered Porcupine earrings from here and absolutely LOVE them! I had asked about the sizing of the earrings and they were really kind in answering questions and even sent me a picture of a few of the earrings to choose from. They responded within the hour I had asked about them. I had the earrings within 2 weeks after ordering. Would definitely recommend buying from this vendor.
Most beautiful earrings I own! Absolutely in love!
"Love,Love these earrings, just what I ordered,Awesome"
"The earrings are absolutely perfect. Panagiotis went out of his way to send a second pair to me, after the first set had some production errors (black scratches). Knowing that I had to have them by my partner's birthday he sent me the replacements and they arrived within a few days - all the way from Athens! The replacement set were perfect, and very well made. Highly recommend."
"E' ben fatto e bello, riscuote molto successo. I produttori sono a disposizione via mail per tutte le domande."
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
These ear crawlers are so beautiful and really comfortable! I like them so much I ordered more pairs in different colors! Communication was great and shipping was fast. They also were packaged nicely. I can't say enough good things!
"Yet another stunning piece of jewellery from Charlie Morgon. Beautifully made, these versatile beauties can be worn either as ear climbers or dangles and work equally well. As always, fabulous communication and service. Highly recommended ‚ô•"
"Really lovely looking! My wife loves them, and they are the first ear rings that she has worn in years! Thanks"
Tiny but beautiful studs that are my go-to every day now. Love them!
"This pendant it‚Äôs fabulous. I love it and it‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for. The seller? Hmmm...one word: PERFECT. Charlie didn‚Äôt disappointed me, and created the pendant exactly by my requirements. Cheap and a masterpiece. What else do you need? Thank you for this marvellous pendant X"
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.

"Lovely item, very well made, super cool earring. Lilian went out of her way to make this (I only ordered one) & to make sure I received it. A 5 star + experience all round. Thanks Lilian."
Love them ! They look really good when worn. Thank you!
I just love my new earrings! I get so many compliments when I wear them. Will definitely be ordering from this shop again!

So beautiful!! Shipped quickly and was exactly as pictured. Subtle yet so fashionable and very high quality! Will definitely purchase more from this shop. Highly recommend
"Adorable, little ear crawlers for my daughter. She loves them. Even cuter in person."
Such beautifully dainty earrings! I‚Äôll be back.
"LOVE the earrings! No reaction at all, i have sensitive ears. I‚Äôve seen some reviews saying the backs of the earrings are longer than expected, but that‚Äôs not my experience at all. Perfect length & don‚Äôt poke me in my sleep. Beautiful, simple set. Very fast shipping too!"
Such gorgeous earrings - really beautifully made and such pretty designs. Plus they came in pretty packaging with a cute note. Thanks Ohana!
I love this earring. I wear it pretty much constantly and it doesn't irritate my piercing at all. I'm glad it has two holes so you can choose the size based on your earlobe - I use the smaller size.
"Bellissimo, regolabile in altezza! Ottima qualit√†!"
"Dainty and elegant, and I love that you can wear it a few different ways! Seller was so nice to work with."
Despite some delays and no way to track my actual order it still arrived within 3 weeks and the cuffs are beautiful. Would definitely recommend!
"So so cute, love the colours!! Super lightweight and feminine. I've received compliments every time I've worn them! Quick shipping and great customer service"
The pieces are very well made and beautiful. Great communication and fast delivery. Definitely recommended!!
Arrived super quickly even with COVID slowing everything down. Super beautiful and absolutely love them
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
I previously ordered the matching earrings and now I have the pendant in the rose gold color. They‚Äôre beautiful and elegant. They are very versatile and can easily be worn with evening attire to casual attire and however you choose to wear them. The earrings are also comfortable and that‚Äôs one of the requirements for me. The chain that comes with the pendant is very small/narrow/thin and the clasp is as well. I have already have a different chain and a choker that I will use the pendant on. I highly recommend the pendant and the earrings.
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
"These earrings are absolutely fabulous. They look so great with my mustards, yellows, and blacks. A jeweler friend today was very impressed with the workmanship! I love this seller's work! Highly recommend! <3"
"I absolutely love these earrings! I‚Äôve worn them many days and they are fabulous! They hang so nice and are a real attention getter. The bead work is perfection! They arrived so quickly, too! I‚Äôve since bought more. This seller is wonderful!"
"fact that they are very contemporary but not heavy looking or feling, and I can easily customize each piece with the colors to match my outfits. The artist will send you all the colors of the beads for you to select just the right colors! she has numerous colors in each color category so you can get exactly the right colo9r to match. the sercie and communication is great. One of the best vendors I have worked with at Etsy!!!! I highly rec-commend this Artist. :-) Leslie Richards /Interior Designer, Naples, Florida"

Love these! Love the size and reasonable priced. Thankyou
Jolies boucles d'oreilles qui vont bien avec un ensemble du m√™me type.
"Sympa mais comme c'est un produit unique et fait main, le tissu ne rend pas comme sur la photo : sur les 2 paires achet√©es (une pour offrir) il y a plus de rose, peu de couleur claire contrastante et pas de violet, √ßa fait moins wax et √ßa flashe moins mais tant pis, merci pour la rapidit√©"
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
2 √®me commande chez vous et je suis ravie. Tr√®s belle paire. Je compte faire prochainement une autre commande. Bravo üòÄüëèüèø
"c'est magnifique ! boucles ultra l√©g√®res, agr√©ables √† porter et tellement gracieuses !"
Just loved this little cute tape. I got the orange background and it is vibrant and whimsical.

All the way from France!!
Love these!!
"I could not be happier with this piece!!!! The size, fit, color and quality are PERFECT!!! Just what I was looking for. Thank you!!!"
Love!!! Sorry for the delay in posting
"They are really beautiful. Its going to take a little getting used to, but I love them!"
"LOVE them!! So cute, even more beautiful in person. I was accidentally sent 2 left ones but the owner replied immediately and sent me a new pair. Thank you so so much!!"
"I absolutely adore these earrings, they sit perfectly as long as you put the back on tight enough. Very shiney and cute, and I've received lot's of positive compliments about them. They arrived in a pretty presentation box and bag. Thank you üíó"
I Thought my package was lost in the mail but I just received it! and it was worth the wait! these are so beautiful! thank you so much :)
"Absolutely gorgeous !!...they sit beautifully, and are so sparkly....love them !"
"The pieces are absolutely breath taking. The photograph doesn‚Äôt do them justice in the least bit. I am absolutely in love. As for communication, it was superb. He kept me updated throughout the entire process; from shipping to arrival. Also did a courtesy check to see if I had actually received the package sent. I look forward to purchasing many more pieces with time of course, the prices should be excepted considering the quality of pieces. Don‚Äôt hesitate üëåüèª"
My ring arrived very quickly and is just as pictured! It's beautiful and the seller was extremely helpful and responsive to my questions. Would absolutely buy from this seller again!
Beautiful coins! Excellent communication with seller and was impressed with super fast shipping. Will definitely buy more!
"Just great, I love the ring, the communication was great, great seller, I will buy again from you. All the best."
"The earrings look beautiful. I had assumed they were made with a light cardboard covered in African print. In fact they are quite thick, strong and heavier than most earrings of this design. They are slightly too long for me: the bottom edge touches my shoulders. If you like big, bulk earrings you'll love these because as I say, they are beautiful. They just weren't quite what I was looking for."
"Vom Material und von den Farben bin ich total begeistert. Allerdings sind sie doch etwas gro√ü. Wer sich die Beschreibung durchliest, ist echt im Vorteil. Im Sommer werde ich sie aber auf jeden Fall tragen. Sie sind wundersch√∂n."
Tr√®s heureuse d‚Äôajouter √† ma collection ces superbes boucles d‚Äôoreilles ‚ù§Ô∏è ! Merci elles font leur effet
They are absolutely beautiful. Bigger than I expected but beautiful

I requesting some modifications, all of which were happily accomodated. I paid for my items, and regardless of international shipping, received them shortly thereafter. On receiving them items, I LOVED THEM! They were just as beautiful in person as they were viewed online. I am so happy. I would highly recommend purchasing from this shop. Communication was fast and effective, and the jeweller does beautiful work."
"J?ai achet? des boucles d'oreilles pour mon mariage. Elles sont parfaites. Merci pour vos conseils, vos photos envoy?es en complement et votre envoi rapide."

Super pretty! Picture doesn‚Äôt do just to how stunning these are
Elegant and sparkly! Adds instant subtle attraction and is not too over the top. I love the jacket type and this is the first of many!

"I requested a custom item, and was met with kindness, quick responses, and it turned out perfect!!"
"Absolutely stunning!! Ilona worked with me to create custom earrings and matching bracelet for my upcoming wedding, and I could not be happier with the final product! My blurry picture doesn't do it justice, but it's so sparkly and beautiful! Ilona is such a sweetheart and will totally make your day when you receive your jewelry in the mail :)"
Ilona did an AMAZING job! The earrings made my wedding look complete! Thank you SO much!

Absolutely stunning. I bought the snake ear climbers and I‚Äôm in love. Well made and they get tons of compliments.
Picture doesn't do it justice! So beautiful! It's a little big on my pinky ring but I'm keeping it. Paula was very responsive in my messages to her. Can't wait to buy more!
"LOVE, love LOVE this ring!!!!!!!!!!!!! Took a while to get here but hey between COVID and Paula living in ISRAEL it‚Äôs understandable. I bought 3 of the same rings - 2 for gifts , everyone LOVED them and they are all GREAT!!!!! I just wish the band were a millimeter or so thicker. Otherwise GREAT QUALITY AND CRAFTSMANSHIP!!!"
this came on time and is a perfect add-on gift lovely
Very pretty once in place but very fiddly to put in.
"I was really excited about these Ones , but they never arrived. I had thought maybe I didn‚Äôt order them until I just got this email.. so hopefully they are just really late and still arrive! ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Update to 5 stars because I love these. Will probably order another pair in case I loose one!!"
These delightful red Hoops are just the right size and shade of red. Bought them on an impulse to add some flair to my work Zooms!

"I LOVE my new earring!! I can‚Äôt wait to show it off this weekend. It‚Äôs very comfortable, and I didn‚Äôt have any trouble getting the post through my piercing. I got a message as soon as it shipped, and it took about 2 weeks to get to me, which I though was pretty quick for overseas. It‚Äôs such a cool statement piece!! Thank you!"
I customized my earring with a different sized post and it‚Äôs perfect! I absolutely love it!
"I have no words but to say I‚Äôm in love with my earrings, they‚Äôre are beautiful, unique, and definitely turns heads. Definitely recommend! Thank you so much! I love them so much!!!"
"Ces boucles sont belles, originales et de bonne qualit√©. Les produits sont soigneusement emball√©s et l'envoi rapide. Je recommande."
"Tr√®s joli ! Envoi soign√©, jolie boutique. Je n'h√©siterai pas √† passer commande √† nouveau. Je recommande vivement !"
Tr√®s satisfaite de ces boucles d'oreilles et conformes √† la description. Re√ßues rapidement.
"Un seul mot : parfait! Absolument parfait en tout point! Ravissants petits bracelets tr√®s soigneusement confectionn√©s, je suis ravie. Cr√©atrice tout √† fait charmante et attentionn√©e, qui a pris la peine de m‚Äôavertir d‚Äôun doublon survenu au moment de ma commande (d√ª √† une erreur de ma part), je lui en suis tr√®s reconnaissante. Elle m‚Äôa ensuite tr√®s gentiment conseill√©e et m‚Äôa m√™me envoy√© des photos des articles avant l‚Äôexp√©dition. Merci, merci infiniment pour tout et pour la tr√®s d√©licate attention gliss√©e dans la commande. Je reviendrai avec un r√©el plaisir. √Ä bient√¥t donc, et encore merci! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"These are gorgeous necklaces in person! The pictures do not do them justice. They are dainty and delicate and I am so excited to wear them. In fact, I will be ordering more colors!! Seller is so great to work with- I highly recommend this shop!"

"Love love my dangle red earings. I purchased them as an after thought when buying a necklace (which I love too) anyway, it turns out that the earings are now one of my go to pieces of jewelry. I'm favoriting this shop."
"Beautiful piece of jewelry! It arrived much sooner than I expected and is great quality! The chain length is perfect, and the chime ball produces a beautiful sound. It's exactly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier with it!"
"Bola tr√®s joli et conforme aux photos (pendentif plus gros qu'attendu dans la mesure o√π il enveloppe le grelot). Livr√© dans une jolie pochette organza, qui elle m√™me est gliss√©e dans une petite pochette cartonn√©e (en plus, c'est √©cologique). Envoi extr√™mement rapide (exp√©di√© le jour de la commande !) et tr√®s bonne communication. Je recommande √† 100% !"
"Merci beaucoup pour ce joli bijou que j'ai re√ßu dans un tr√®s beau paquet cadeau pour No√´l fait avec beaucoup de soin ! Vraiment tr√®s appr√©ciable ! Le seul b√©mol c'est qu'il n'y a qu'un anneau pour attacher le collier, on ne peut donc pas regler la longueur mais √† part cela je suis tr√®s satisfaite ! Merci"
"My order came super fast, everything was packed really cute and the earrings were perfect! Thank you!!"
I love them! Wearing them now! shipped super quick and in a cute little box. Like a present to myself!
They are perfect!! Love them:)
I love it! I have sensitive ears and they do not like to be closed in with the back of an earring so these are perfect! Well crafted and with love!
"I have bigger earlobes so whether or not an earring will accentuate that has always been my concern. These earring bars are the perfect size in terms of the length and the thickness, and I like that it's a round bar and not a square one. The back clasps are tight and secure and the posts are sterling silver, which are all great. To me they stand out amongst other Etsy bar earrings in all these features. What's worth noticing though is that the posts used here are slightly shorter and thicker than normally what you would see in stores (for example Claire's earrings). It has two dents at the end and only the second one fits my ear. Make sure you measure the earring posts you normally wear to avoid getting your ears squeezed and swollen!"
"Love these earrings. The pearl with the plain silver jacket is a great match together, which makes for a nice feminine look. üòä"
"These are the perfect every day earrings! High quality, have been wearing my original pair for almost 2 years and they haven't tarnished and are still beautiful rose gold."
Very happy with these minimalist and beautiful earrings! Just what I was looking for in terms of length and thickness of the bar studs.
Even more beautiful in person!!
Tr√®s po√©tique et re√ßu rapidement.
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. It‚Äôs such a dainty ring and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it.
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."
Absolutely gorgeous! I've received lots of compliments. Fast service.
I originally bought these for my bridesmaids back in 2019 and kept checking back for a year hoping these would come back in stock so I could buy a pair for myself. So thankful they came back and I could get a pair! They are beautiful!!
"Ces. BOucles d oreilles chic et sport √† la fois, bon fermoir. Et facile √† porter. On les oublie. En plus elles sont belles. Merci BellaChix boutique."

Absolutely perfect! I was looking for a pair of small ear climbers for my second lobe piercing and this is exactly what I wanted! I've gotten so many compliments and I look forward to many more purchases from this shop!
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"
Vraiment magnifiques boucles d oreilles
"Exactly as described-perfect. This shop was great, they allowed me to change finish after I'd already clicked purchase. I highly recommend them."
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"I love my triangle ear crawlers! It took me a bit to figure out how to put them in, but I figured it out and they look awesome! Will be ordering again from you!"
Gorgeous and unique! I have the circles and I plan to order the square ones next. I love these! I really catches people‚Äôs attention!
"Super cool and beautiful, as always! Hoping to eventually get all the shapes!"
fast shipping. fits perfect and very comfortable. loving this great and unique style
I love the combination of shapes and textures in these earings! They are unique and beautiful!
I love the shape and color of these earings and how they are the perfect size. Thank you for beautiful earings and quick shipping!
"Beautiful earings! I love the shapes, colors, and the size is perfect! Thank you!"
"Superbe, envoie un peu long justifi√© par la rentr√©e, qu'√† r√©ception de la commande, j'aurai aim√© avoir r√©ponse au message... Mais toujours ravie des boucles d'oreilles !"
"I love this item. It took me a minute to put them in right, but once in they stayed where they belong. Shipping was quick considering the distance they came, and packaged really nice, especially if they were a gift. Very pleased, will buy from this person again. Thank You"
Love!!!! So excited to wear on my wedding day!
"beautiful ear climbers! came earlier than expected, thank you."
Gorgeous!! These earrings are awesome. Thank you!
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them. Shipping was super fast by the way, well impressed! I highly recommend getting something from UrbanRaven, you can tell she makes her jewellery with a lot of love. :)"
"Even more beautiful in person! This is a gift for my mother's birthday, and I wouldn't have bought a special gift from anyone else. Everything is top quality, unique, and we'll made. This is my jewelry store!"
"I absolutely LOVE these earrings! Dainty, light weight...I received many compliments my first day wearing them. So well made. Thank you!! Fast shipping too!!"
I ALWAYS get compliments on these beautiful ear pins. Top rated quality and craftsmanship! Thank you!
Had 2 pair of these in my cart and another pair. All came together and shipping was very fast. The packaging is very sweet and let me say that the pictures do not do these earrings justice. So gorgeous in person. I love them. Ordering another pair. Quality is amazing! Earrings are extremely comfortable and light weight. So happy I ordered them.
"One of the most beautiful pieces iv ever had made ,This seller is so kind and helpful ,I asked him if he could do a Jesus piece with angels And actually put some diamonds in there with it, Really didn't think it was possible But they managed too fill all my dreams and expectations ,I really really can recommend This jewellery shop For expert quality And beauty Hope to do some more custom pieces with the shop, I'm extremely grateful"
"Absolutely wonderful ‚ù§thanks so much too the seller I wanted a gorilla diamond pendant ,And it is such an incredible job They managed to do for me ,really great custom service üòÄ Was made extremely quickly just a couple weeks, I can really recommend this jewellery shop To anybody ,With great results at the end Really appreciate all the hardwork you put into this thanks again üòÄ"
"Absolutely amazing seller I didn't think it was possible, I asked them if they could create a roaring gorilla ring for me , Absolutely awesome, Really lovely can really recommend this jewellery shop, so helpful Very quick response and fast shipping and delivery üëå great üëç thanks so much üôè"
"Ring is quite pretty! My only complaint would be that the rose gold finish came off after about 3 days of wear. It‚Äôs still lovely but more like a very light gold colour. If you have your heart set on rose gold, this might not be be the best option."
"i had a custom order. she and i talked a lot about what i wanted and she even took pics of everything so i could see before she sent it to me. she did everything perfectly. i am a happy camper to say the least. she is FANTASTIC. don't be afraid to ask for custom work, you can get anything that the artist can provide within reason..it works."
"Alors comment dire... J'ai flash√© sur ce sautoir ! Malheureusement √† la r√©ception je l'ai trouv√© bien trop court. J'ai longuement r√©fl√©chi, c'√©tait ma premi√®re commande chez Julie. Est-ce que je vais l'ennuyer avec mes probl√®mes de centim√®tres ou pas ? Je le conserve comme √ßa mais je ne le mettrai pas ? Et j'ai tent√© le coup ! Et Julie a r√©pondu √† toutes mes attentes. Elle m'a rallong√© la ""b√™te"" (c'est le nom d√©sormais de mon sautoir) et il est magnifique, pil poil ce que j'attendais. D'ailleurs je le porte aujourd'hui ! Alors mille mercis Julie, et conseil √† toutes vos futures clientes : allez y les yeux ferm√©s !"
"Colis re√ßu avec beaucoup de retard (3 semaines au lieu des 1 √† 3 jours ouvr√©s annonc√©s) et surtout aucune r√©ponse √† mes mails demandant des nouvelles. Lorsqu'enfin je re√ßois mon colis, j'ai enfin droit √† un semblant d'explications, mais apr√®s avoir pass√© 3 semaines sans aucune nouvelles, c'est un peu tard √† mon gout. Cerise sur le g√¢teau, j'ai d√ª recoller l'anneau qui s'√©tait dessoud√© du cabochon de la bague... ""envoi rapide et soign√©"" : PAS CONVAINCANT DU TOUT!!!"
this was a custom piece too and it came out just right too! she is just a true artist. i love her work. if you want something special try Julie's work .she will not disappoint.
Looks great and exactly as described. Prettier in person than over a computer

These are just lovely! Beautiful rich color. I am very pleased. They arrived quickly!
Have ordered several of these charms and they are all equally beautiful. Very happy with this merchant.
"These are stunning ear cuffs! So strong and solid and very comfortable! They look great on the ear lobes or worn on the outer helix both sides! I wish i could take a picture but there's a fault for some reason? I love Peris's jewellery collection, i have a beautiful hoop from him as wellüòä Thank you so much again and sorry for late feedback ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"

Beautiful hand made piece of jewellery. I love my new pendant. It is obvious that it has been made with love and is exactly what I wanted. The seller went to every effort to make this a perfect experience.

Magnifiques cr√©oles assorties √† leur noeud pour cheveux ! Je suis fan. Envoi et qualit√© irr√©prochable.

"Stunning MIZAM bracelet from Morocco. I have never seen one with this amount of detail , quality , and weight. The workmanship on this bracelet is exquisite. Another piece of jewelry from Fouad I will treasure . Great communication as always and it arrived quickly. Thank you Fouad !!"
"It is my first purchase from the shop. Faoud, the owner is very polite and handled my order very quickly. The jewelry speaks for itself.

I just received this today and it is such a beautiful piece!!! I really love it. The shipping was really fast too. Thank you so much!
Naar verwachting: leuke oorbellen.Alleen hadden de kwartskralen voor mij wat dieper van kleur mogen zijn. Maar ik weet het: een natuurproduct...
"These pink jade pierced earrings are pretty, but a lighter pink color than shown on my computer. They are a soft pink, not a bright pink. The earrings are well-made, safely packaged, and timely shipped. Thank you."
Came yesterday!!! Wooo woooot!!! They are staying in my ears except when in the shower!!! Totally in love üòç!!!
"This was one of my most pleasant and ultimately fun purchases from Etsy. I had Lola And Cash make a silver (etched?) figure necklace pendant from a picture my late father drew. My dad drew the silliest illustrations and Running Dude is one of my favorites. So much so that I saved his drawing from years ago and now I've put it to another good use! (The first one was on a mug.) L&C's work is *so* brilliant, I couldn't believe the perfect, quirky likeness! I'd wanted the drawing's idiosyncrasies (dad's personality) to shine through and WOW, what a success here! It's perfect! The admiring comments from others makes me wanna high-five my dad, wherever he is. <3 People can't believe how clever it is, marveling over the technique and the skillful execution. I can't imagine *not* coming back for more... thank you, Lola and Cash!"
Omg this bracelet is the best!!! Vikki managed to get my dogs head tilt absolutely perfect!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Every time I wear it I‚Äôll look at it and smile which is what I do at home when he looks at me with that crazy tilted head! This is my new favorite piece of jewelry. Lola & Cash is the best place to get beautiful and creative jewelry!
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
Commande re√ßue dans les d√©lais. Tr√®s contente de mon achat. Fait avec beaucoup de minutie.
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d‚Äôoreille, l√©g√®res et de bonne qualit√©. Envoi rapide et soign√©. Parfait ! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"Article joli et conforme √† la photo mais qui ne correspond pas √† ce que je recherchais. Je ne sais pas pourquoi, je pensais qu'il s'agissait de grandes cr√©oles, alors qu'elles sont minuscules, les morceaux de coquillages sont eux aussi tr√®s petits (moins de 5 mmm de longueur). Je regrette que le vendeur n'ait pas mis de photo qui permette de mieux se rendre compte de leur v√©ritable taille et n'ait pas pr√©cis√© leur dimension dans la description. Je regrette √©galement de ne pas les avoir demand√©es avant de les acheter. Tant pis pour moi."
"Bijoux magnifique, vraiment plus que ravie de cet achat ! Tr√®s r√©active et compr√©hensive, je n'h√©siterai pas √† commander de nouveau :) Encore Merci !"
Elles sont superbes ! Merci l‚Äôartiste !
These are beautiful !! bought them as a gift and they were carefully packaged and arrived on time. I cant stress enough how pretty and delicate these are. Would def buy again :)
These earrings are very well made. Love the colour. Can wear them for both dressy or casual wear. Very quick delivery. Will definitely order from this supplier again.
J'adore ces boucles d'oreille ! Elle sont l√©g√®res et durables et d√©taill√©es. Article envoy√© rapidement dans une super petite bo√Æte ! Merci
It is my first time shopping on Etsy and I am surprised by the good quality. It looks so pretty on my ears. It is not bulky and so comfortable. It goes so well with my floral print dress. I definitely recommend it to my friends! Absolutely love it!!!
Every piece of jewelry I‚Äôve gotten from them has been so beautiful! I can‚Äôt wait to see what else this shop will release. Shipping was within the expected time frame and no damage to any products when they arrived. Everything came just like what is shown in the pictures!
"I am happy with the pin I got from them. the quality is great, not too shiny nor dull, and most importantly it fits very well with my ear. They surely adds charm to the person who wears it. As I was afraid that the pin does not match my ear size, I dropped them a message and they responded very fast and provided quality follow-up. Nice Job!"
It is absolutely gorgeous! It's super comfy and not heavy at all. It shines beautifully in the light and are hands down my new favourite earrings!
"I recently had a pixie cut and these earrings compliment my new hairstyle quite well! They are bold and fun, which exactly what I wanted :)"
"These are gorgeous!!! Much better than the photos! The contrast of blue and white is stunning. .. Although the size of the clip is smaller than others, and not secure, and slipped off,, quickly,,, resulting in getting lost. ( I loved them so much that I insisted on putting them back on many times.) I deducted a star for that. Quick delivery, good packaging and a great personal feel to the service. Thanks Fad√©la ""ClipAddict"" !!!"
I love the mother of pearl clip on top and the beautiful iridescent colors in the shell. I wore these earrings with my mother of pearl ring. They looked great together.
"Though the earrings are very beautiful on the screen. They are even more beautiful in person! I love the detail in the glimmering crystal beads. They come in a cute little silver sack. Though there was some trouble with my order (it took longer then expected, since I ordered in August and they caused my ears some pain) Fadela was very helpful in checking in when the order was delayed and suggesting I get clear lacquer to help with the pain. All and all, I am very pleased with my purchase."
These very well made and uniquely styled. I love them! Nice packing a well!
Love these earrings. Cant wait to wear them.
"Beautiful earrings, fast shipping.. love your shop‚ù§Ô∏è"
It‚Äôs absolutely stunning! Exactly as pictured and just perfect! Also really fast shipping.
"Shipment never arrived! Seller blamed delays in shipping companies, and never provided a tracking number! Seller then ignored me and months later still no response! DANGER !!!!! DO NOT BUY !!!!! THIEF !!!!!"
J'ai achet√© 2 paires diff√©rentes pour offrir. Les 2 sont superbes. Arriv√©e rapidement. Parfait !
Tr√®s belles boucles d‚Äôoreilles et originales en plus ! Je n‚Äôai que des compliments malgr√© le masque ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Je vous recommande cette cr√©atrice !!! Elle est a l‚Äô√©coute , r√©active et professionnelle. Elle a des cr√©ations originales. J‚Äôai command√© une paire de boucles d‚Äôoreilles elles sont conformes √† la photo et livraison rapide"
"Une petite merveille comme les pr√©c√©dentes. Trop ravie. Je suis certaine qu'elles vont plairent √† mon amie. Livraison plus que rapide. D√©j√† dans la boite aux lettres, deux jours apr√®s la commande. Merci pour tout."
"I‚Äôm non-binary, so I was looking for a ring that would make me feel a little more masculine but that still fit my (really long and skinny!) fingers, and this ring is perfect! It‚Äôs so beautiful, very well-made, and the shop owner even reached out with a coupon code before I made my purchase!! It came in a lovely little leather-type pouch‚Äî5 stars all around. I feel so stylish and handsome with it on!! I hope you make more, similar styles (maybe in silver) soon!! Thank you!!!! (Also, please ignore my dry winter hands in the photo)!!"
"I really wanted this back in May but I was iffy about the whole ‚Äúadjustable‚Äù ring aspect of it. Yet when I went to check on it again, it was sold out. I made sure I purchased this time and I am so happy I did. It is beautiful and no it doesn‚Äôt have a gap to adjust which is what I was worried about. Easily one of my favorite new pieces of jewelry and I know I will wear it a lot. The shipping was also insanely fast. I‚Äôd highly recommend not only this piece but also this seller. Love it. Thank you!"
"The owner, Melina, is super tentative and caring! They messaged not once, but twice to inform buyers how to care for the product and to ensure it arrived on time. The earring is super cute and simple, easy to pair with any outfit. The only two things I think some people might have to say about it (but not me cus I love it!) is that it might be considered short in some peoples' opinion, and its kind of more of a yellowish gold than a gold gold. But I think the pictures do accurately show this so I was expecting that and still love the earring the way it is! :)"
"As one reviewer mentioned it is very shiny, but to the point that it looks a little out of place with my other jewelry that is solid gold or more toned down gold filled. However, for the price I'm not expecting something that will perfectly pass for solid gold. On it's own or with jewelry of a similar sheen it's very pretty. The fit and feel of it is perfect!! It's my best fitting bracelet and I like the weight of it. Also, it came so much faster than expected! Very good seller who also promptly answers questions."
I realy like this bracelet the shop made .looks so light on my wrist i put my little tiny pendant on it .i going to do the same with the necklace i just ordered .yesterday.. Thanks so much .from the usa...... I love French stuff.
"Tr√®s joli collier qui tombe bien dans le creux du cou. Command√© √† l'occasion d'un anniversaire, le fil est discret et le fermoir parfait. Je recommande sans h√©siter car la pierre est d'un bleu fonc√© tr√®s joli !"
The seller is super sweet. I love the necklace as well. She does custom designs so I am going to come up with something special for my mom!
Necklace is very beautiful!!! Great quality! I got length 38 and it fits perfect! Love it!
These earrings are gorgeous! I put them on as soon as I received them. They are so comfortable to wear and look so cool. The earrings were securely packaged and arrived quickly. Also included was a cleaning cloth and lovely note. I will definitely be back! Thank you Kate.
"These earrings are just what I was looking for! They are dainty and unique, perfect for my everyday wear. Thanks Kate for great communication and lovely packaging! I'm impressed. :)"

Absolutely love these earrings! I love the versatility. You can have a dainty post or add a dramatic flair with the jacket. So cute!
I love these! Looks exactly like the picture!
"These made my ears turn green‚Äînot made of the materials described! Neither rose gold plating or the sterling silver underneath should do that. I have purchased from the seller before and never had a problem. They ultimately refunded me, however, people should know the quality is subpar."
Cute! They‚Äôre just as described & they were shipped in a timely manner.
"I ordered two pairs and absolutely love both! The 10mm line studs I got in Sterling Silver Matte and I love the matte with those it really makes them pop! I also got the Hammered Crawlers and the shape of my ears fits perfectly in the 13.5mm. I truly put them in and forget until I look in the mirror, and I've always had really sensitive ears! Definitely recommend, as well will be back again!"
"Absolutely beautiful and highest of quality. They match my plaistos coin necklace I purchased in Crete, Greece perfectly!!! Thank you and wishing you a very blessed Christmas!"
"Very lovely earrings would definitely shop again Seller is very approachable and helpful , I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for more items coming from them"
Im completely obsessed with this necklace! It hasn't left my body since I received it! Super quality!
This ring is very beautiful and met all my expectations. The coin on top is a great size. Im very excited to give this ring as a gift because its so beautiful. I would purchase from this vendor again.
BO Magnfiques encore plus jolies en vrai que sur la photo. Je les ai offertes et elles ont fait un tabac. Envoi rapide et soign√©. Communication tr√®s facile avec la vendeuse.
"For the second year in a row, I purchased earrings from OSingulierBoutique, the pieces inspired by the tiny Greek islands of Amorgos (last year's purchase) and Koufonissia , (this year's purchase) - both places which we visit on our trips back 'Home' to Greece. The pieces are made well, durable, look beautiful, and best of all: They truly do remind us of our favorite places. The deep turquoise blue and gold in the Amorgos piece clearly take inspiration of the island, it's so obvious I can envision it. The same for the bright blue/greens of the Koufonissia piece! the color of the Aegean Sea hitting the beach, and the bright white golden color of the sand are spot on. If a Patmos inspired piece is made, we'll take it!"
"J ai re√ßu mes boucles d oreilles tr√®s rapidement. Sur photo, elles √©taient tr√®s jolies, en r√©alit√©, elles le sont davantage. Tr√®s l√©g√®res, color√©es, tr√®s bien emballees et avec go√ªt! J adore!! Merci"
"Bijoux cr√©atifs de toutes sortes, de toutes formes, mati√®res eclectiques. Tr√®s agr√©ables √† porter, finit magnifiquement une tenue. De plus j'adore la fermeture de celles-ci. On en redemande toujours plus, jamais rassasi√© car beaucoup de renouvellement. Vite allez y !!!!"
"Very, very beautiful earrings! Wondefully made and lovely to wear. They also came wrapped and boxed beautifully. Since I made a mistake with my own adress, i was in contact with the seller and she was nothing but kind, patient and helpful. Very highly recommended!"
Arrived on time and well packaged. A really pretty pair of quality silver earrings that are well made and are a good price. Very happy with my purchase.
"Exactly what I was expecting, so happy with it"
Too forever to get to the USA!
"Ch√®re Marta, Ces boucles sont encore plus belles que sur la photo ! Je les adore ! Merci d'avoir travaill√© si vite pour moi, Marta ! Je vous souhaite de bonnes f√™tes, profitez-en au maximum, je pense que nous en avons tous besoin. Au plaisir d'une nouvelle commande. Tr√®s cordialement, Claude P√©ronnet ‚ôÄÔ∏è"

very classy and tasteful earrings!
"Ich liebe diese Ohrringe! Der Versand hat l√§nger gedauert als angegeben, da habe ich den Verk√§ufer angeschrieben und der Kundenservice ist mega! Man bekommt schnell Antworten und er hat ein neuer Paar losgeschickt. Sie sitzen super. Man muss sich ein bisschen an den Sitz und das an die Ohren klemmen gew√∂hnen, aber nach 2 Tagen klappts perfekt üòÑ Ich habe schon viele Komplimente bekommen und man bleibt nicht an den Ohrringen mit der FFP Maske h√§ngen. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Love them! Simple, something I can wear everyday to add a little touch. Especially since Covid, I‚Äôve been wearing absolutely no jewelry/earrings. So I like that I can look nice without being over the top. Definitely want these in the gold."
"these don't really stay in my ears that well, but I think it has to do more with the shape of my ears rather than anything else. They are beautiful quality and they make for a gorgeous, unique ear curation."
Magnifique !
Les bijoux sont vraiment tr√®s joli. Ils ont √©t√© envoy√©s tr√®s rapidement et re√ßus sous 5 jours. J'en suis tr√®s contente! De plus ils sont tr√®s tr√®s bien emball√©s j'ai √©t√© agr√©ablement surprise
"Superbe bijoux raffin√©, bel emballage et envoi rapide. Je recommande !!!!!"
"Comfortable, cute, fast shipping. I love it, thanks so much."
"Love them,will recommend to anyone"
"Wow. I have bought silver hoops before, but these blow them all away. They are SO well-crafted and beautiful! Not too heavy for my delicate earlobes and totally hypoallergenic! The clasp is one of the best--it snaps right in place, without wobbling around and clicks right into it's matching latching hole (I purchased some white gold hoops that didn't have such craftsmanship). These are my new favorite earrings. They look beautiful and I love the cubic zirconia ornamentation that's perfectly delicate. The earrings were so well packaged and included a silver-polishing cloth. I'm in Chicago and it took a good while to get them from Germany during the pandemic, but they were worth every second of the wait. The seller is extremely kind and accommodating--she takes obvious pride in her craft. Will buy from her again!"
Als ich diese Ohrringe sah war es Liebe auf den ersten Blick <3 Ich liebe Fr√∂sche und deswegen mussten diese putzigen Racker bei mir einziehen. Sie sind sehr sch√∂n gearbeitet und sehen sehr hochwertig aus. Der Versand ging super schnell und der Kontakt war unglaublich toll mit der lieben Anja. Danke daf√ºr! <3
"I have a confession to make. I bought this ring for myself. And yes it did take time getting to me. But I freaking love this ring. It is so cute. It fits on my ring finger, and is durable. Important thing in the life of a barista."
"wow! just wow! these are the cutest little earrings. bought in anticipation for a second piercing but they are so versatile, well made and perfect. so impressed!! thank you!"
"I am always happy with the purchases I make! Very dainty, simple, and beautiful! Perfect gifts, too!"
Gorgeous ear climbers. Tasteful and elegant. I am so pleased with the quality.
"Absolutely perfect for me, it covers some old piercings and suits my personality perfectly. Very pleased, thank you!"
"Merci pour l'envoi de ces beaux bijoux dans un joli pochon et bien prot√©g√©s par l'enveloppe bulle. J'ai bien aim√© le message timbre ""Un grand merci"" ! Tout est arriv√© dans le d√©lais estim√© par Etsy. J'utilise deux bagues d'oreille dor√©es (une martel√©e et une ""classique"") et elle sont confortables, tiennent bien et habillent joliment mes oreilles :) Le collier initiale et l'autre bague d'oreille dor√©e sont un cadeau pour No√´l, et j''esp√®re que √ßa plaira ! Belles f√™tes de fin d'ann√©e ! (m√™me si elles ne seront pas comme les autres !) P.S. : Je mets le m√™me avis pour chaque bijou achet√©, d√©sol√©e pour la r√©p√©tition !"
"J'attendais avec impatience mon colis et claiiirement je n'ai pas √©t√© d√©√ßue ! Je suis ravie du bijou, il est magnifique (tout comme le reste des bijoux command√©s), √ßa habille parfaitement mon oreille comme les photos le laissaient pr√©sager ! N'h√©sitez pas !! :)"

"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"
"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ma commande qui est arriv√©e dans un temps record ! De plus, Marjolaine est vraiment tr√®s gentille, elle avait joint un petit cadeau en plus, et l'article command√© √©tait emball√© √† la perfection. Je recommande vivement cette SUPER Boutique de notre si belle √ÆLE DE BEAUTE !!"
"These earrings look so good and seem to be decent quality but I must have smaller than normal ears, as the posts are almost completely visible from the front. They don't seem to sit horizontally and point straight down."
very pretty and it came on time
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"

"Superbes ces √©maux, j'adore ! merci pour tout !"
"Superbes ces √©maux, j'adore ! merci pour tout !"
received my pieces and they are so beautiful and colorful and fun to create with. What an awesome shop owner who helped me tremendously with a custom order.
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them. Shipping was super fast by the way, well impressed! I highly recommend getting something from UrbanRaven, you can tell she makes her jewellery with a lot of love. :)"
"Even more beautiful in person! This is a gift for my mother's birthday, and I wouldn't have bought a special gift from anyone else. Everything is top quality, unique, and we'll made. This is my jewelry store!"
"Great quality ear climbers, excellent value for money. Very prompt despatch that meant they arrived in time for Christmas. The person I bought them for loves them. I would not hesitate to use this seller again."
"These are really lovely, look very striking. The earrings themselves are shaped like a hair grip and you can adjust the fit to make sure they stay in place. Very pleased with them, thank you!"
"I got these as a birthday present for a friend and she absolutely loves them. The customer service was amazing. When I first ordered them they sadly never arrived but when I contacted the seller she was so helpful and sent another pair on recorded delivery. My friend was so happy when she did get them. I highly recommend buying from this seller, you'll be in good hands!"
"Really dainty and elegant, really love these! My first ever pair of earrings! Shipped quickly and arrived before expected date."
"Wonderfully crafted earrings, great communication, speedy delivery - many thanks!"
"I absolutely adore the pearl stud, but this is my second one due to the pearl completely popping off of ring! I barely wore it too."
"Asked Seller a question and they responded very fast. Placed my order soon after, and it shipped in a timely manner and arrived pretty fast. Love the nose ring, no complaints what so ever! Very complimenting piece."
"I had concerns about when my package was supposed to be here, and they replied with me fast and with reassurance. Their jewelry is amazing and I get compliments on my nose ring all the time. highly recommend."
"De d√©licieuses petites boucles qui ont ravi la personne √† qui elles √©taient destin√©es. Le bonheur c'est simple comme un achat chez MagalineArts, tout est parfait dans les moindres d√©tails! Patricia est une cr√©atrice charmante aux talents multiples qu'il faut d√©couvrir absolument! Merci pour tout!"
"Parfait!! C‚Äô√©tait un cadeau de No√´l pour ma fille, elle a ador√© et les a mises tout de suite."
"These earrings are so lovely and very, very unique. I love the color and they are quality made. Thank you for such a gorgeous, unique pair of earrings that will match everything I wear."
"Very, very pretty, delicate and beautiful earrings. Really quality made and durable so they will last a long time. Thank you, Patricia!"
"The earring jackets are lovely, were described accurately and were shipped so quickly that I received them in time to wear at a wedding - didn't expect that!"
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
"I purchased these earrings to wear on my wedding day and was blown away by their delicate loveliness, detail, and craftsmanship. Even prettier than the pictures and extremely well-made! The package arrived in good time with a pretty little box and a personal note from the jeweler. Very pleased with my purchase and experience <3 THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
This item was as nice in person as it was in the picture. It came in a beautiful little gift box with a small silk rose attatched to her business card. Very creative packaging & a beautiful piece of jewelry. I would not hesitate to order from Osnat again. I was a little worried about the tracking & I notified Osnat & she responded that same day ( even though it was on a weekend & it was her day off).
the earings are beautiful. this is the 3rd or 4th pair of earrings ive ordered. the craftsmanship and attention to detail is amazing. theyre not heavy at all and my fiance loves them. I highly reccomend anything that argaman osnatt makes.
Absolutely perfect‚ù§Ô∏è
"Lovely! There is no clasp but rather a drawstring. It's hot! not as tight as I‚Äôd like_not a game-changer. It's a great purchase & I'm feeling the vibe. Plus shipping was fast! Gotta love that!!! Thank you! ü§ó It's October 28th and I'm still rocking my cuban choker. I get compliments all the time, especially the silver string on the back. Type sexy. It's real, I did the magnet test. Still stunting. Thanks, again!"
"Holy Cow Ladies & Gents . If you want an amazing necklace! This is it!. Its so beautifully made & there is so much detail in this piece that i cant even begin to explain.. you can see for yourself its gorgeous & well worth the money spent! So happy i bought this.. and so happy the owner didn't 86' me from his store, cus im a pain in aah tha rear.. and so truthfully, such a great, confident in his product & most of all, a truly patient guy.. ü§óThank you! ( you did say you'll be waiting for my pic with it on & you sure were right about that! üòâ.."
"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much when I placed the order and had very low expectations that I wasn't going to hate it and that it would be flimsy, etc... This bracelet is GORGEOUS!!! I absolutely LOVE it! I ordered 2 of them and not sure which one I love more!!! They don't feel flimsy or cheap at all! Highly recommend them! Will definitely be ordering more!"

I love these climbers! I needed solid rose gold bc I wear them 24/7 and my previous plated gold climbers lost the gold. But I didn't want real diamonds in case I ever lost them. So these solid gold with CZ were the perfect combination. Very comfortable and sparkly
"Well The 14k two tone gold Gucci was beautiful but the size 2.5 that I got it was hard to see the two-tone! But That‚Äôs just my opinion. This being my first gold necklace, an Denize was wonderful I contacted her and I exchanged it for a solid Gold color marina, 14k gold necklace length 18‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Also purchased a second necklace 14k solid tricolor gold Valentino, 22‚Äù and I love that one too, both from Denize."
these 14 karat gold crisscross ear cups are absolutely perfect they fit my ear great you can bend them to fit your ear if it doesn't fit right their ass pictured it was a quick delivery and I would recommend this shop to everybody they're quick to respond and are very willing to help make it right if you're not satisfied but believe me you will be very satisfied thank you Denize
"OK this necklace is beyond beautiful it shimmers and shines honestly I love it! It‚Äôs 2.5- width an 22in. Length. I really wanted a beautiful necklace but not too big not too small, I feel like I hit the jackpot! The second necklace is also from Denize it‚Äôs a 14k solid gold Gucci Mariner 3mm wide and 18‚Äù long! Together they look Great! Not too skinny and not too fat!"
Great quality and so much prettier then the photos posted. A definate must to add to your jewelery collection.
"I am completely blown away with how fantastic the customer service has been throughout my buying process. Einat was terrific about communication, and even though there were a couple snags she did everything she could to make sure I was happy, and kindly gifted me a little extra goodie with my original order. Plus the pants are super comfy and a gorgeous color. I'm in love ‚ù§Ô∏èüåû LILYOM has just earned a customer for life!"
Beautiful earrings. Definitely buying another pair. Thank you.
I get so many compliments on these!! üôè
Earrings exceeded my expectations they are beautiful! Arrived earlier than estimated date.
I love these; they're a fun take on hoops. They shipped quickly. A good shopping experience!
perfect wedding shower gift for the bride for her honeymoon
"Exceeding my expectation. Perfect size, good quality, with a replaceable filter, a nicely-knitted bag, and a heartwarming note of thanks! I have been looking for facemasks with world map pattern. This is definitely one of the best. Love it."
Wurde als Geschenk bestellt und gleich zum Empf√§nger versendet. Unkompliziert und zuverl√§ssig. Macht weiter so!

"Absolutely love these gorgeous earrings ! They are stunning and fit my ears so well, I adore them! They are beautiful quality too."
LOVE! Shipped out quickly and arrived in a cute pink bubble package with a lovely handwritten note. The earrings are just like the photo. Would definitely buy from this seller again!
"Really pretty. Just as pictured. Shipping took a long time, but I ordered during the pandemic, so it wasn't unexpected. I'm very happy with them!"
"Dear Victoria, thank you for the beautifuly wrapped parcel. The product was as advertised, I loved the delicate design and the lovely card with a discount. I recommend it! Victoria was prompt and extremely helpful during the shipping process."
"These are lovely! I wasn‚Äôt sure how they would look since most of the pictures were of the climbers in the lower lobe / first piercing hole and I planned on wearing them up higher. (Plus my second piercing spot there is really, really old so it‚Äôs lower than I‚Äôd like now) but they still work and look beautiful. It‚Äôs nice having something a little different! Nice color and great quality, too."
"Got so many compliments on these earrings. Love them and for the price, super great! Highly recommend"
"This is the second pair of ear crawlers I bought from VermeilSupplies, and I was not disappointed! My favorite thing about these crawlers is that they stay in place perfectly - not too tight, and I don't find myself having to inch them back into place throughout the day."
"Love these earrings so much, I just ordered a second pair. Good quality and good price. Had some trouble with shipping (item didnt arrive) but seller shipped a second pair at no extra charge. The earrings are a perfect size. :)"
This ring is beautiful and the craftsmanship is unique. The shop was very responsive to my inquiries and emailed me back in 4 hours or less when I had a question.
Les boucles d'oreilles sont vraiment tr√®s belles. Je suis ravie de cet achat. En plus envoi tr√®s rapide. J'ai eu beaucoup de compliments sur ces boucles. Merci
"Parfait ! Tres joli bague üëç ca vaut le coup d attendre ! Merci beaucoup pour le petit cadeau en plus, tres gentil de votre par. Merci pour tout. Je l adore !!"
"Je trouve la m√©daille encore plus jolie que sur les photos. Les d√©tails sont superbes, le poids parfait et la cha√Æne adapt√©e. Un grand merci pour l'attention port√©e √† mes requ√™tes et la r√©activit√© de la vendeuse !"
Really really well made and unique. They go so well with the matched ring.
"I‚Äôve made friendly contacts with the seller before my purchase about shipping and they wouldn‚Äôt respond. I took a chance and bought the earrings the next day. - assuming they were busy due to the holidays. After my purchase- I asked if I could buy an additional jacket, and they didn‚Äôt respond. - rude The earrings are NOT identical. I guess it was a detail I overlooked. I never even got a thank you from the seller! They were not friendly- I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to a friend."
"Great seller! We messaged back and forth a few times when shipping took longer than expected, and seller was very quick to reply and communicated that she stood behind her customers and do everything she could to make sure my order got to me! These earrings are beautifully constructed and i get tons of compliments on them. They are my everyday go-to earrings which easily compliment a dressy or casual get-up."
It's so completely gorgeous! I wore it for the first time on Friday and received so many compliments! Thank you! x
"Another spectacular necklace! My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner! Your craftsmanship is superb, and I LOVE the attention you lavish on details, for example an adorable blossom dangling from the chain tip -- Thanks so much, this was my fourth item from you and you are still the first artist I look for every time I etsy! n"
"Janine was so sweet and replied to all the questions i could have about the earrings. i ended up buying two pairs and im pretty sure i'll buy plenty more in the future. :) plus the earrings were shipped in cute little boxes which, when i got them, make me feel like it was christmas lol"
jolies boucles d' oreilles pas trop grandes. merci beaucoup
Exquisite piece of beading. It used very small beads and is a lovely piece of jewellery.
"Super c'est conforme √† la photo , d√©lai de livraison respect√© et puis je suis tr√®s satisfaite de mon choix."
Boucles d'oreilles tr√®s jolies. Satisfaite de mon achat.
"Completely adorable earrings! They were packed so well, and I was impressed how quickly they got here as they came from overseas. I get complements every time I wear them!"
Adorable ear jackets ! absolutely love them!
"Adorable, my second purchase from this seller. :)"
"Beautiful, very well made, thank you very much!"
"I absolutely love my my ear cuff. It fits snugly and I don‚Äôt have to worry about it falling off. It‚Äôs so comfortable I actually went to sleep with it on not realizing I had been wearing it until the next morning. The shipping and delivery service was prompt. If you‚Äôre looking for a non-piercing ear cuff, look no further. This is the best quality ear cuff I have purchased."
Exactly as pictured and look great with my stud earrings. Shipped quickly.
Rather large and hurts for long term wear as the hoop part is very tight (even after I stretched it with pliers) and very heavy. Perfect gauge size though so might use it for Halloween/cosplay.
Beautiful item! Quick shipping. Will order again.
Great quality and so much prettier then the photos posted. A definate must to add to your jewelery collection.
"I am completely blown away with how fantastic the customer service has been throughout my buying process. Einat was terrific about communication, and even though there were a couple snags she did everything she could to make sure I was happy, and kindly gifted me a little extra goodie with my original order. Plus the pants are super comfy and a gorgeous color. I'm in love ‚ù§Ô∏èüåû LILYOM has just earned a customer for life!"
Gracy sent these in quick time. Very nice earrings. Very light and easy to wear.
"The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think."
Exactly as advertised. Extremely beautiful and delicate (which is what I wanted). I love it! It came quickly and without issues. Will order from this store again!
LOVE these earrings! And I was even gifted a cute letter ‚Äúe‚Äù ring complimentary with my order. Love the simple aesthetic and shipped surprisingly fast to the US!
Love it thanks ‚ú® Though I had to reshape the back because it was too big/loose for me and didnt stay on
Such cool earrings love them üëçüèº
Elles sont justes parfaites... Je recommande
Il correspond pleinement √† ma recherche je suis enchant√©e üòä
"These ear cuffs are awesome. I love cuffs and the more the better. They were delivered so quickly, I had to look several times to see if they were actually from Scotland...but they are. I plan on buying more because the quality, speed and price just cannot be beat!"
"Love it! Stunning ear cuff and arrived super quickly. I ordered a couple of pieces to make my own set and had some small requests which were no trouble at all! All pieces are made to perfection, they are super easy to wear and look fantastic. I'm delighted and couldn't recommend more üòç"
I love these ear wraps. I have never pierced my ears and have never found a comfortable alternative. Thank You! They feel and look great! I will be wearing them for my wedding :)
"Lovely earrings that fit well to the ear. Very happy with them, thank you!"
An absolutely amazing pair of earrings. Like nothing else I own. Thrilled with my purchase!
"Beautiful pieces! Just as expected!! it took a little long to arrive but it was probably due to the pandemic and my location. Very good communication from the seller! I‚Äôm so glad I went for the 3 rings instead of just one, if you‚Äôre in doubt like I was, just get the 3 or more so you don‚Äôt have to wait for more shipments ~ üòâ I can‚Äôt wait to get a manicure and wear these! Thanks~ love it!!! ü•∞"
"These are lovely! I‚Äôve been eyeing them for over a year now and so excited I went for it. I ordered two and wish I had ordered two more! They‚Äôre lovely craftsmanship, great quality and lovely packaging. My order took longer than expected due to covid-19 hang ups, and Mercedes was very communicative and helpful in tracking and updating me with my order. If you‚Äôre on the fence about these, do yourself a favor and get them. They‚Äôre awesome. I‚Äôd take a picture if my manicure was up to date :) (picture coming as soon as these nails are as nice as these rings!)"
"I opened my package today holding my breath but this ring is everything I wanted and more! Elegant simplicity at its finest plus so super light and comfortable, I can't even feel it on my finger. Earlier I forgot I was wearing it and when I remembered I had to stop and admire how beautiful it is all over again! I love plus sign crosses and had been looking for rings so this was perfect for me, I requested a plain shiny finish instead of the brushed silver because I wanted something a bit dressier but still understated. Also because it's adjustable I can wear it on several different fingers depending on my mood and my other jewelry. I have my eye on a few more things here and can't wait to purchase again from this seller!"
Just like in the pic! I love it!
"I bought this for a friend who was absolutely thrilled. She immediately sent me a photo of the sign on her wall and this is when I noticed that Sissi had added a little gift without saying anything to me. Her gesture was greatly appreciated. Sissi's work is beautiful, and I was told she was very careful packaging the item and added the note I had asked her to attach. Communicating with the seller was very easy. She is responsive and extremely helpful. Talent and creativity, combined with excellent customer service, super helpful communication and timely shipping made for a PERFECT experience. I would not hesitate to order again from her. I actually intend to do just that. Very soon."

These earrings are very well made. Love the colour. Can wear them for both dressy or casual wear. Very quick delivery. Will definitely order from this supplier again.
J'adore ces boucles d'oreille ! Elle sont l√©g√®res et durables et d√©taill√©es. Article envoy√© rapidement dans une super petite bo√Æte ! Merci
I'm just in love with my new hair clips! The packaging was beautiful and the shipping was quick! I will most definitely buy again from this shop!
Purchased this as a gift for a teenage girl and she loved them.
"Holy cow I ADORE these earrings! Beautiful, understated, and came super fast. Pro tip you have to twist them in backwards (from the back of your piercing instead of the front) to get them to lay right--took me wayy to long to figure out but was super easy once I did!"
"I love these earrings! I wore them for prom and get soooo many compliments, they weren‚Äôt too heavy either!"
These are absolutely gorgeous. Love them and get compliments when wearing them.
I love these earrings. They're for my wedding; I feel like royalty wearing them and I know none of my friends have seen anything like them! They're great quality too. I tried to take a picture of how magnificent they are on but I could not do them justice. You will not be disappointed with the service and quality if you buy from here!
Turned out absolutely beautiful! I wore them on my wedding day and they were perfect with my dress! Definitely would recommend this shop!
Gorgeous earrings!
Beautifull thanks! Illona is great
"Sympa mais comme c'est un produit unique et fait main, le tissu ne rend pas comme sur la photo : sur les 2 paires achet√©es (une pour offrir) il y a plus de rose, peu de couleur claire contrastante et pas de violet, √ßa fait moins wax et √ßa flashe moins mais tant pis, merci pour la rapidit√©"
Tres belle boucles d'oreilles tr√®s contente
"Je les ai command√© pour une amie, elle est ravie, et les boucles d'oreille sont de tr√®s bonne facture !"
2 √®me commande chez vous et je suis ravie. Tr√®s belle paire. Je compte faire prochainement une autre commande. Bravo üòÄüëèüèø
"Molto carini e ben fatti. Forse le gemme un po pi√π grandi farebbero apprezzarne meglio i colori, ma sono comunque carini. Spedizione ok e venditrice gentilissima. Arrivano in bustine, niente scatolina."
Very beautiful climbers. Very happy to have received
"It was ordered as a gift, extremely happy with the service and quality."
They are a bit whiter in person. Cute and dainty! I wasn‚Äôt expecting them to be hooks in the back but I‚Äôm glad because it‚Äôs easier to put on. I‚Äôm excited to wear them!
Bought them Smoky quartz. Even nicer than the photography. Really satisfied and look forward to give my wife for Christmas :) On my post office in Norway one week after purchase.
Fast and perfect!! Awesome quality and workmanship!!
"gorgeous, craftsmanship is superb when seen close-up. my girlfriend is going to love these!"
"the ring is beautiful and SO shiny, i swear you could see it from across the street in the sun. love the design and energy, figuring out another to order for the other hand ü§î"

Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreille ! Merci beaucoup !
Vraiment jolie je les adorent
"Tr√®s mignon et l√©ger √† porter, c'est parfait !"
I purchased 9 items from ShlomitOfir and every piece is exquisite and beautifully made. There are so many more items from the collection that I desire. The jewelry is elegantly boxed and arrived in very good time.
"Ordered these for myself for my boys to give me for Christmas. I definitely peeked when they arrived, and they look exactly like the picture. Can't wait to enjoy them!"
Love the design! The earrings are as pictured - good quality. Also super cute packaging!
So many compliments! Will be back for more soon!
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."
Je suis ravie ! La commande a √©t√© exp√©di√©e en 24h et est arriv√©e en environ 15 jours. Les boucles d‚Äôoreilles sont parfaitement conformes √† la description et correspondent tout √† fait √† ce que je souhaitais ! Je vais d√®s √† pr√©sent ajouter d‚Äôautres articles dans ma wishlist pour une future commande !
"Lovely earrings! They are delicate, very elegant and so original, though a bit smaller than expected. They come in their own little box. I get hundreds of compliments when wearing them!"
WELL worth the wait through customs honestly! quality is great and they're so cute! i know i'll get a lot of wear out of them
Scrivo un‚Äôunica recensione per tutti gli acquisti fatti... STUPENDI! E poi Valentina √® gentilissima ed ha risposto subito alle mie domande. 5 stelle meritate!
These two are my OTP so when I saw the option to make my own pairing this is what I went for. They are incredibly cute! The matte colors are actually a little brighter than in this picture. They came packaged super safely with extra wrap inside and outside their custom box.
"I've been meaning to leave a review for a while now so here it is: a) it was sent to me in a cute little box, snug and carefully packaged, b) it's exactly like in the picture, and c) they are just adorable! and d) Deadpool would be proud. I get compliments on them at work and they really stand out. I am definitely going to buy here again in the future! :)"
"I love this necklace so much! I wanted something elegant for special occasions, but would also look stunning with more casual ensembles, too. The metalwork is impeccable are there are no rough or sharp bits where the wire was soldered. So delicate, but durable, and I won't have to polish it! Thank you for such an amazing piece!"
Paire de boucles d'oreilles re√ßues ce matin et elles sont encore plus belles en vrai ! Bijoux tr√®s bien emball√© et prot√©g√© et envoie tr√®s rapide ! Un petit √©crin avec un emballage m'a √©t√© livr√© car la paire est pour un cadeau (m√™me si j'ai h√©sit√© finalement √† les garder pour moi tellement elles sont belles ahahah ^^ ). La qualit√© est au rendez-vous et ce genre de bijoux fait tout son effet pour toutes occasions. La cr√©atrice est d'une extr√™me gentillesse ! Je recommande cette boutique √† 100% !
"Aurelie's creations are absolutely stunning - they make the magic of this world seem so much more close. I feel so fortunate to now possess such pieces. If that were not enough, Aurelie was very easy to get in contact with and so kind when I had questions regarding my order. This was my first piece from Aurelie, but it will not be my last!"
"The ear hook is beautiful and light weight, the fit is good even though I have very small ears. Great service, she was able to make it custom for me with no problem. I will buy from this shop again."
"My earrings are beautiful! They are incredibly light, and exactly what I wanted. These are the most comfortable, adaptable, ear crawlers I have ever worn. I ordered these to wear to my sister's wedding. Unfortunately, shipping took a lot longer than the estimation I was given, and I did not receive them in time. (As I am located in the US, this is to be expected I'm sure.)"
"Very pretty, they fit the edge of my ears nicely - not too long or wide."
I absolutely love these earrings! I bought them because I had purchased from this Etsy store before and was pleased with the jewelry. I love that these eat jackets have three different holes to adjust the length. They are beautiful!
"I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them."
I love these earrings!! I wear them almost everyday. This was my first purchase on etsy and I cannot be more satisfied. Thanks Arajera!!
"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
"I really liked my earrings. They're a bit bigger on me than on the model, but I do have small ears. They also arrived a bit on the late side, but I did order them during the holidays, and the shop owner was very attentive about the situation, so I'm still giving a five star review. Very pretty! And sturdy!"
OBsessed with these! So many compliments and so well made. :)
"I love this so much, there absolutely beautiful and their exactly what I thought they would be. I have never had the style of earring before so I didn't really know how to put them on, But now that I have them on I am in love!!thank you Tiff and Micah"
Out-by-God-stounding. Love these earrings. Get the 7 stones. They curve EXACTLY how they're supposed to on my ears. Have no doubt they will be my every day earrings. Will be ordering from this shop again. Stones are super iridescent. Worth the wait.
It took a while for the package to come in but it was fine. Everything was nicely packaged and nothing was damaged. I didn‚Äôt realize I had the wrong pliers but they still worked. I had flat square ones that made it kinda hard. I just used a paint brush to make the loops. There‚Äôs a video that you follow along with on YouTube. It took me about a hour and a half. I don‚Äôt have any experience in this kind of craft. I couldn‚Äôt have done it without the video. It turned out great and I‚Äôm excited to see what other products they offer. My cat loves playing with the wire as I was making it. I also had an extra foot of each wire when I finished.
I love these. They look real!
Parfait jadore h√¢te de les porter
"Adorables petits boutons dont je vais me servir pour d√©corer la couverture d'un livre. Ils sont arriv√©s rapidement et le petit ""Merci"" sur la carte de visite m√™me pour une si petite commande m'a fait plaisir (ainsi que le timbre ""Positive attitude"", il m'en faut pas beaucoup ahah) ! Merci √† vous :)"
I LOVE them!
"Livraison rapide et soign√©e A l'int√©rieur : 2 sachets dor√©s et blancs, l'un √† rayures, l'autre √† pois... Ces boucles d'oreilles sont originales, belles Merci Francesca pour tout cela, ainsi que pour le sachet de diff√©rentes jolies pierres Je commanderai √† nouveau"
"Subtiles et raffin√©es , je les adore! Tr√®s gaies, tr√®s printani√®res. Dommage que ce type d'accroches ait tendance √† s'accrocher dans mes foulards."
Tolle Ohrringe. Haben mir sofort gefallen. Sie sind nicht zu gro√ü und filigran vom Design. Super f√ºr den Sommer. Auch die Patina gef√§llt mir gut.
super mooie oorbellen!! blij mee
I really love her snd her design!!!:)
Had these made for my Twin sisters birthday. First set got lost in the post from Spain to the UK but Milagro was amazing and helped no end sorting another set and speaking to the Post office. First class customer service and I will recommend her to my friends and family. I will definitely purchase more items in the future.
"The earrings are absolutely beautiful, I'm very happy with them. Very quick and helpful answers to my questions about the personalization. Very cute and festive wrapping too."
Amazing!! The earring is perfect! And the owner is really nice person:) I definitely order again from her!!
"I really love these earrings. The posts are thin which makes it easy to put them on. Sometimes they fall vertically, but I think I just have to figure out how to adjust the earring backing and post so they stay put. These are the perfect size and color. They are minimal and elegant. Delivery was so fast, too. Jut as beautiful as the photos. Exceptional experience."
Tr√®s belle paire de boucles d'oreilles ! Conforme √† la description ! Originale et d√©licate ! Je les adore ! Les d√©lais de livraison √©taient rapides !

I love these silver polishing cloths! These are so handy! Fast shipping and wonderful service! Thank you Olivia!
"I was so skeptical to order at first since it had very few reviews but OMG. It‚Äôs GORGEOUS. Honestly, the pictures online don‚Äôt do it justice. It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. The shipping was incredibly fast, even faster than some places here in the states. It‚Äôs the perfect size, it‚Äôs dainty, it‚Äôs GORGEOUS!! Love, love, love!!! Worth every penny. I am SO pleased and happy! I tried to take as many pictures as I could for the review but, again, pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! üòç thank you so much!!! Wish I could leave more pictures!!!"

Arrived beautifully wrapped and very quickly. I've been wearing it ever since I opened the parcel! It's absolutely beautiful. Many thanks!
the ring is so beautiful! it's exactly what I wanted!! thank you so much :)
Just what I wanted! Perfect!
I now have three pairs of these wonderful ear jackets! I am wearing studs that l haven‚Äôt had on in years because these jackets make them look amazing! Great seller...great product!! Thanks!
these are wonderful. make my studs look fabulous.
"3mm earring jackets - love these keep my 3 prong settings from ""settling"" in my ears. nice packaging and fast shipping"
"LOVE these earrings! They are just as described and pictured on the Etsy page and even better! They arrived sooner than anticipated and in a nice box with a lovely hand written note; nice touches. But really, the earrings themselves are wonderful. I'm super happy!"
"Beautiful earrings! I always get so many complements on them. I would recommended these to anyone! It is always an easy process to order from Emerald, and she makes sure that everything is perfect. I also received my order very fast!"
"Lots of compliment , wore them To Super Bowl party on 02-07-16 . Love them"
"These are gorgeous, love them! Super fast shipping! Thanks Emerald!"
Earrings are lovely! The order was dispatched within a day and took just over 3 weeks to arrive in the UK. The seller was really helpful and prompt to reply when I messaged them. Overall incredibly happy.
beautiful!! seller was amazing at staying in contact too. these are for my wedding day.
"Nicely made, delicate sterling silver earrings with tiny sparkly zircons. Just the right thing for affordable holiday bling!"
"These are the second pair of these earrings I've bought! I'm just obsessed with these ones as I am the others. Such cute earrings, and I've gotten so many compliments."
The earrings are beautiful! I love them soooo much!
"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"
en ce moment je n ai pas de chance avec mes commandes ! je n ai pas re√ßu ce que j ai command√© ! pour ce faire pardonner j ai re√ßu un petit cadeau : petit tr√©s petit .... √ßa m a fait sourire ; mais je ne suis pas fach√©e et cela ne m emp√®che pas de faire mes modestes cr√©ations Merci √† tous sinc√®res sympathie .... Anne Marie
"Tr√®s bonne r√©ception, colis r√©alis√© avec soin, et tr√®s bonne communication avec le vendeur fort professionnel. Le porte clefs en lui-m√™me m√™me est superbe, color√© et moderne. L'esprit r√©cup est tout √† fait l√†! L'objet correspond parfaitement au descriptif. Bonne continuation, et bravo pour votre travail! Dolores"
I love them and they are really lightweight.
"ne correspond pas du tout √† la photo ni aux descriptifs, finitions tr√®s mal faites, et se permet de faire des r√©flexions je d√©conseille fortement ce vendeur"
"Patricia a √©t√© rembours√©e de la totalit√© de son achat imm√©diatement apr√®s sa r√©clamation. Pour le reste, chacun est libre de penser ce qu'il veut."
Arrived safely very nicely wrapped good service Thank you . Something a little different to recyle an unusual item.
Very pretty and unique earrings. Didn't realize they would be matte silver rather than shiny but love them anyway and goes with other matte silver I own. Thanks for your wonderful design and craftsmanship
"I love the versatility of this earring design. It's easy to picture wearing these as only studs on both ears, with the stud plus earring jacket on both ears, or a stud on one side and a stud plus an earring jacket on the other side. This look is pure fun. ‚ù§Ô∏è! Marilee"
It took a long time to be delivered but it made in the promised time and the wait was totally worth it. They are well made pieces! Very pretty!
Best earrings. This is not the first time I bought earrings from virginiawynne I love the work and each piece is unique.
"wow! joanna, thanx ever so much for all the work and creativity you put into to my beautiful earrings. what a pleasure it was to work with you. i sincerely appreciate your ‚Äúadditional creativity‚Äù in making my earrings specific to my requests. looking forward to additional one-of-a-kind pieces!"
"Lovely little acorn + oak leaf earrings! üçÇ I‚Äôm a November baby, my husband proposed to me nearly a decade ago on my birthday and our wedding anniversary is also during the same month! Petite and full of sweet detail, these are the perfect earrings to reminisce on Fall memories and to celebrate Autumn with! I will dearly treasure these pieces. Thanks ever so much, Joanna!"
"I had this ring saved in my favorites for over a year. Finally took the plunge and I'm so glad I did! It's so dainty, romantic and slightly minimalist. Just my style! The moonstone is cut gorgeously with a slight rainbow tinge to it. The fit is perfect and it came just in time! The seller responded promptly to my questions. Great experience overall ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"This seller is incredible. I had a custom ring made for my beloved with a very specific vision in mind. When I received the ring at first, it didn't turn out how I had wanted it. The seller provided exactly what I had asked for, so no fault on their end, it just wasn't exactly what I had envisioned. I messaged the seller about it and they were so helpful and patient with me. They offered to remake the ring at no extra cost . In very short time, the seller was able to recreate the ring and send the new one to me. This ring is absolutely everything I wanted to give to my other half. The work is so beautiful, and it looks very carefully made, down to the last detail. I am very grateful to have picked the seller that I did. Outstanding customer service! I would absolutely order from them again. Thank you for everything you've done!"
"As others mentioned the shipping was super fast, and they are so cute and delicate. I love the way they look. I got three copper birthstone stackable rings, garnet, peridot and topaz. But I literally got these in the mail *today* and they already turned my finger so green. Idk if it‚Äôs the increased hand washing/sanitizer right now or what, but I definitely won‚Äôt be able to wear these everyday. I‚Äôll try and share a picture."
"When I received the rain it was much smaller than the picture, but what I love üíï the most about the ring is the colors staying out on my finger, and overall even though it is smaller than the picture it draws a lot of attention from others who is looking at my fingers."
"Oh my gosh, exactly what I was looking for to match the ring!!! My order even came with a bonus chakra wish bracelet! I‚Äôm so impressed and will be ordering again!!"
Stunning! Excellent customer service and item arrived as pictured. Perfect quality and even more detail than expected. I am delighted to enjoy these earrings. Thank you üíò
Seller was so super helpful throughout the entire process! The ring is so stunning and I‚Äôm so happy with everything :). Thank you so much üß°
"Lovely experience! The brooch is wonderful as shown in photos. It arrived perfectly packed, in a super sweet gold bag, everything inside the original Dior box. Lara sent the brooch immediately and she also gave me a tracking number. I really recommend her shop <3"
"Absolutely beautiful!!! I wear it all the time, the quality & service are exceptional! Thank you for finding this üíé gem!"
"i had a custom order. she and i talked a lot about what i wanted and she even took pics of everything so i could see before she sent it to me. she did everything perfectly. i am a happy camper to say the least. she is FANTASTIC. don't be afraid to ask for custom work, you can get anything that the artist can provide within reason..it works."
"Alors comment dire... J'ai flash√© sur ce sautoir ! Malheureusement √† la r√©ception je l'ai trouv√© bien trop court. J'ai longuement r√©fl√©chi, c'√©tait ma premi√®re commande chez Julie. Est-ce que je vais l'ennuyer avec mes probl√®mes de centim√®tres ou pas ? Je le conserve comme √ßa mais je ne le mettrai pas ? Et j'ai tent√© le coup ! Et Julie a r√©pondu √† toutes mes attentes. Elle m'a rallong√© la ""b√™te"" (c'est le nom d√©sormais de mon sautoir) et il est magnifique, pil poil ce que j'attendais. D'ailleurs je le porte aujourd'hui !

Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles conformes √† la description... Comme je l'ai dit pr√©c√©demment colis re√ßu avec retard (plus de 15 jours au lieu des 1 √† 3 jours ouvr√©s annonc√©s) d'autant que c'√©tait un cadeau d'anniversaire...date largement d√©pass√©e... Vraiment dommage car ses cr√©ations me plaisaient beaucoup... mais grande h√©sitation.
"Colis re√ßu avec beaucoup de retard (3 semaines au lieu des 1 √† 3 jours ouvr√©s annonc√©s) et surtout aucune r√©ponse √† mes mails demandant des nouvelles. Lorsqu'enfin je re√ßois mon colis, j'ai enfin droit √† un semblant d'explications, mais apr√®s avoir pass√© 3 semaines sans aucune nouvelles, c'est un peu tard √† mon gout. Cerise sur le g√¢teau, j'ai d√ª recoller l'anneau qui s'√©tait dessoud√© du cabochon de la bague... ""envoi rapide et soign√©"" : PAS CONVAINCANT DU TOUT!!!"
These earrings are beautiful - I love them very much!
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
"Seller was great to deal with. Prompt delivery. Earrings are beautiful! Well made, and nicely packaged for a gift."
"Pretty, lightweight and well made."
"These ear climbers were exactly what I wanted! Delicate wire, beautiful hammering and they are not irritating my ears like so many other metals do. I am very happy with my purchase. Shipping was amazingly quick as well! I ordered Friday night and they were in my mailbox on Monday."
Very dainty and beautiful! Love them! These shipped quickly and were packaged perfectly. These are the type of earrings every girl should have...they can be worn with everything. Thanks for the awesome service and earrings. Highly recommend purchasing from this shop!
"Simply beautiful, very comfortable. Love them!"
"I like these SO MUCH and so do other people -- I get lots of compliments. But, sadly, they just don't work well, at least nt on my ears. I have tried to modify by bending them, etc, but to no avail. I'm still wearing them but only on rare occasions when I can deal with having to fix them every 30mn to an hour."
"I'm sorry you are unhappy with your purchase. Despite the fact that I have sold dozens of pairs of these earrings to happy customers, I do realize that everybody is shaped differently and these may be a bad fit for you. This is why I offer a 14 day return and refund policy! I want my customers to be a 100% happy! Please contact me if you would like a refund and I would be happy to help you."
Beautiful unique item and well made. It took a bit longer than expected but Ashley explained what the issue was and I completely understood the delay. They are beautiful and my daughter loves them! Great shop
The cutest ! Thank you so much you did an amazing job. Super sweet and very accommodating! I am obsessed with my earring!! Thank you again !
"Beautiful, unique piece of jewelry that is well-made, and reasonably priced. I love how tiny the shark teeth on it are, I was expecting them to be larger, so they are super cute and fit on the ear well. Thank you!"
"Always amazing and truely helpful costomer service, beautiful earrings."
"**I would not recommend these as the design is not functional at all.** I really wanted to love these and gave it lots of time to use them but the design is just not suitable. Unfortunately the earrings that crawl up the ear don‚Äôt stay in place. They end up falling off my ear and don‚Äôt actually stay up my ear. I love the look of them, they are so creative and gorgeous but they are not actually functional. For the amount you spend I can only use one of the two earrings and that is not worth it. I messaged the seller about shipping before placing the order, since Covid. I got a response and she was very kind."
original !!! bon site et envoi soign√©
"I ordered the sterling silver earrings and they are so beautiful and shiny! They are very comfortable to wear and I love how the earrings are a classy looking statement piece. Shipping was very fast also, I received the earrings much faster than expected."
"These earrings are lovely! Exactly what I expected. They are a little too long for my ears, but they still fit and are the size I ordered. I've been wearing ear-climber earrings for a while and wanted to try a different style. :) They do look lovely, though! Also, the shop owner was very good with communicating when I asked a simple question about my shipment. Five stars!"
"These are so beautifully crafted and so cute and unique! I LOVE them. I love that they can be worn a variety of ways too. They are a little smaller than I expected (not sure why as she gave plenty of references for size.... maybe having a photo of them actually being worn by someone would help?). The seller had great communication, emailed me back quickly, and sent them off quickly. I even had some concerns about the weight of them, so she even included a return envelope just in case (they are very light weight, I'll be keeping them!), extra backs, and a special bag to store them in that prevents tarnishing. I'm already trying to figure out what my next pair from this vendor will be :)"
"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
Suited my wedding dress perfectly.
Re√ßue hier je suis ravie. Cette robe que je vais porter en tunique est superbe.Le tissu tr√®s beau et son col noue apporte beaucoup. De plus cela va me booster pour me mettre au r√©gime car j'avais pas pris conscience de ma prise de poids et suis serr√©e ( √©tait rest√©e avec mes anciennes mesures ) donc effet 2 fois positif !!! Merci
Love my bracelets I keep ordering more!

Luscious in color and style! I can wear in several ways so I can wear everyday if I'd like. And I am thinking that I'll do just that!! Thank you for sharing your great talent with all of us! You are easy to LOVE!!!

perfect wedding shower gift for the bride for her honeymoon
"Exceeding my expectation. Perfect size, good quality, with a replaceable filter, a nicely-knitted bag, and a heartwarming note of thanks! I have been looking for facemasks with world map pattern. This is definitely one of the best. Love it."
Wurde als Geschenk bestellt und gleich zum Empf√§nger versendet. Unkompliziert und zuverl√§ssig. Macht weiter so!
very impressed with the quality
"Nice earrings, as expected. Nicely packaged, and I received them pretty fast. They are very delicate- I bent them a little bit while I was cleaning them. And the backings are SO SMALL!! They were really hard to get on the earring when they were in my ears. I have never seen earring backings as tiny as these. It's not a matter of the post being smaller than average, because I used earring backings from another pair, and they fit just fine."
"These are really cute! The stars are cut cleanly and they look like they do in the photos. They are comfortable to wear and easy to clean. This is the second set of earrings I've purchased (the other is a different star crawler) and the quality is consistent from this seller. They seem delicate, but they've held up quite nicely so far."
Perfect and they look so good in my third hole travling up my whole ear
Love these earrings. I wanted something small and cute for a second hole piercing. These are perfect! They arrived quickly too!
"so the best packaging award goes here! very nice, if it was gift, they would be impressed"
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"
"I was so excited to get these in the mail and I tried them on as soon as I got them. Unfortunately, the posts bent out of shape immediately. Bc the overall shape of the earrings, you kinda need to finesse the backing on instead of sticking it straight in like I attempted to. I tried to straighten them out and they‚Äôre still wearable but still not completely straight. I‚Äôve never had this happen with any other earring before so I was disappointed, but otherwise they‚Äôre still very nice on and aren‚Äôt heavy. I wore them for a few hours and forgot they were there. Shipping was fine and I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get them anyway."
"I LOVE these ear climbers! They are very well made and do not look bulky on the ears...and they hold very well if correctly tightened!! There is no silver stamp on them, but that is probably because they are hand made: they certainly look like they are made of good quality sterling silver. I am very happy about this purchase!!!"
"Joli bijou, mais qui gagnerait √† √™tre incurv√© pour mieux √©pouser l'arrondi de l'oreille."
"I love this piece! It‚Äôs so cute! I will say that if you like leaving your jewelry in for long periods of time, you will need to like just go over the jewelry with like a cotton swab and something to clean it with. Gets kinda dirty fast for some reason! Will buy from this seller again. Lol I‚Äôm like super faded in the pic but it shows the jewelry so whatever lol"
"I love the nose ring so much I ordered 4! Lol, for my double nostril and double helix."
I love these silver polishing cloths! These are so handy! Fast shipping and wonderful service! Thank you Olivia!

Tout mignon kit de boucles d'oreilles.
"This ring is beautiful (and I love that it comes from France!) It looks exactly like the picture. It's a little large (I do have small hands) and (also due to small hands) I have to bend it A LOT to make it stay on my finger, which changes its shape slightly... and after wearing it a couple days it turned my finger slightly green??? All that's to say, I'm still really enjoying this ring and highly recommend this shop (and it actually came super fast considering it was coming from over seas) Would definitely order from them again."
The beads are perfect for my necklace with large old African copal beads. They are lightweight and slightly irregular which is just what I wanted - and they looked exactly like the ones in the picture. And the seller sent me extra beads - 51 instead of 40 - PLUS two larger beads which were perfect for my design. A few of the beads needed reaming to let the cord through but that was easy since they are made from wood.
I love these. They look real!

They are super cute earrings!
"Ever since I've watched the K-drama, ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"" I have fallen in love with these earrings. I'm so glad I got to actually purchase them here on Etsy from this fantastic studio! They shipped FREE, arrived exactly on time, and in perfect condition. The earrings were EXACTLY as I wanted them - rose gold color, delicate, just the right amount of shine and shade. Every detail was perfect - expectations were well-met! These are delicate though, so just be sure not to exert too much pressure on them as they can bend easily. They're handcrafted, so treat them with more care than you would your other earrings. Overall, I absolutely loved this purchase. I don't change jewelry much - I've been wearing the same pair of earrings for about 6 years now - but I just had to get my hands on these. And, I'm so glad I did."
"Very pretty product! Shipping was fast, and came in a cute little tiffany blue-like bag. Only thing was that it came with a little scratch, but it was not too visible. Would recommend product and owner seems very nice!"
"Earrings are perfect, lightweight and matches any outfit. They are really comfortable to wear all day. Definitely will make future purchases from this shop! They were super helpful during the purchasing process, which I'm so thankful for!"
The set is TINY! Would not recommend.
"Arrived fast, nice quality earrings, very unique style."
"These are so cute, gave them to a friend and she loved them!!"
Good product by a responsive vendor. Shipped on time and arrived quickly without any issues.
These earrings are beautiful. I wore them for my wedding and a number of people commented on how pretty and unusual they were. I was a bit worried that they wouldn't come in time but they came quickly and boxed carefully and presented well. Very pleased!
Absolutely beautiful earrings! The quality is great and the service was excellent. I definitely can't wait to add more to my collection!
"I can't wait to wear these at my 8-person wedding, and they are not so fancy that I couldn't get away with wearing them at other occasions :) Feel great on, not too snug or heavy."
Beautiful earrings very impressed with quality and service thank you
"The earrings looks even more stunning in person! So beautiful, can‚Äôt wait to where them for my wedding. Earrings were packaged beautifully."
These are too gorgeous and they were well packaged. Definitely recommend anyone on the fence if they are worth it. Can't wait to wear on my wedding day!
They are beautiful and it will help make my daughters wedding so much more
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
Stunning! Great gift idea
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
I love these beautiful crawler earrings! They are the second pair of crawlers that I have purchased.AND..i have my eye on a few more. Very satisfied... With my purchases and the great customer service. Try a pair...you'll love them.
So lovely and delicate! Exactly what I wanted!
Love these. Beautiful color! Fast shipping
Got these earrings for a gift and she loved them! Prompt shipping

The items came earlier than expected. The earrings are very beautiful and pretty in person. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase. I‚Äôm waiting for the earrings to get back in stock to buy some more. They went out of stock as I just checked :)
"Exactly what I wanted! Durable sterling hoops. Lightweight. Super shiny. I wish I could put a back on them just in case, but none of my backs are big enough. Would buy again!"
"Very pretty product! Shipping was fast, and came in a cute little tiffany blue-like bag. Only thing was that it came with a little scratch, but it was not too visible. Would recommend product and owner seems very nice!"
I absolutely adore my new ring. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúpass down‚Äù piece of jewelry. Shipping was perfect and the seller Rhea was very awesome and her website is even better! I will definitely be ordering more. I may even like this ring more than my wedding ring lol!
"Lovely earrings, shiny and beautiful! Shipping was fast and traceable. I am only giving 4/5 stars because when I wear the earrings I feel a slightly uncomfortable sensation, maybe it's just the gauge of the stick or maybe my ears are way too sensitive, it probably just needs some wearing to get used to it."
"Perfect fit! I love ear crawlers and ear cuffs, but the one size fits most usually don't work out for me, but Rhea's always seem to fit perfectly for me. Love it. The cute bit doesn't cut off circulation either."
"I chose this company because their carved rings appeared to be of uniformly high quality--thinner bands, beautiful crystals and precisely shaped. Rhea's communication and service was warm and so helpful--I could choose the exact ring to purchase, and she confirmed the ring size I needed before mailing. The ring itself is gorgeous and as described/pictured."
Perfect earrings for my big day.
So beautiful. Cannot wait to wear it! The seller was considerate about warning me on longer shipping time but it arrived much earlier than expected. Very pleased.
Absolutely beautiful with the secure hook for the upper part of the ear!
They are beautiful and my daughter loves them.
I totally forgot to indicate in the notes which ear I needed. I‚Äôve only purchased ear climbers for both sides of my ears. I was surprised when I received my ear climber in the mail that it had a post and back. It absolutely made my day!
Cute addition to my bar earrings! With a little more flare
The earrings came exactly as pictured. They‚Äôre made of good material (haven‚Äôt tarnished or irritated my ears) and are comfortable to wear while I sleep. 10/10 would recommend.
Love it. Good quality. Fast shipping.
In love with this earring.
Very beautiful earring! It sits perfectly on the ear and it is very sturdy! Love it! Thank you!
Mein neuer lieblingsohrring. Ganz tolle qualit√§t
"This Turquoise wing ear cuff is beautiful. I love it. The picture does not do it justice as it shimmers in the light. It did not arrive on time. But I emailed Tasha and we got it sorted. So no problem. I also have the silver cubic zirconia one. Which arrive on time and that is stunning too. They are both extremely comfortable and stay in place. They do not fall off at the top of my ear or have to be pressed tight to stay on and make my ear go red in the process, like others I have purchased from other sellers. I will not hesitate to order from Tasha again. Thank you Tasha, you really know what you are doing."
"Tr√®s belle cr√©ation! Super rendu mati√®res et coloris, qualit√© et l√©g√®ret√©. Livraison rapide, emballage soign√©, tout est parfait! Merci beaucoup =) +++"

"These pink jade pierced earrings are pretty, but a lighter pink color than shown on my computer. They are a soft pink, not a bright pink. The earrings are well-made, safely packaged, and timely shipped. Thank you."
Satisfaite de l'achat de mes boucles d'oreilles en Sugilite.
I just received this today and it is such a beautiful piece!!! I really love it. The shipping was really fast too. Thank you so much!
"Vera was really nice about contacting me to check with the customizable length. When I asked her what length the model was wearing in the picture, she actually contacted the model and asked for me. ü•∞ü•∞"
Very pretty and unique. Quick shipping! Reasonably priced. Very happy and highly recommend!
Super belle !!
"I loved a certain pattern that was in this shop and had wanted them in dangling style. Genevieve had excellent communication, openness and went the extra mile to accommodate my request. I am extremely happy, thank you!"

"Lee is not only a phenomenal artist, but she saved Christmas! Thank you, Lee for going above and beyond to ensure it arrived on time, because it did! Oh yeah, and the piece is stunning! She loves it!!!"
"Absolutely LOVE my ring! Not only is the quality of the product amazing and so beautiful, Lee is so friendly! I ordered the wrong size and Lee was nice enough to re fit the ring with no issues what so ever. I would really commend ordering from her - I've already set my eyes on my next purchase ;)"
"Lovely ring. It is an everyday, substantial setting that is very well made. The snow agate is beautiful and of course unique. The seller sent pictures of four differerent stones for me to choose from. Please be patient as each ring is handmade to order. As a customer I felt that my order was supported throughout and that my custom was appreciated"
These very well made and uniquely styled. I love them! Nice packing a well!
Love these earrings. Cant wait to wear them.
"Beautiful earrings, fast shipping.. love your shop‚ù§Ô∏è"
They are beautiful ! I'm so happy I bought them! Shipping was very fast! The opals are very pretty and the style is unique ! MW
Beautiful. Just as I had expected.
"Very pretty, nice quality!"
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"The earrings are exactly what I wanted. I needed amethyst ones which the seller was able to accommodate. I would 100% recommend jewelry from this seller. The earrings are beautiful, and I was also able to use the studs for my engagement pictures."
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!

I previously ordered the matching earrings and now I have the pendant in the rose gold color. They‚Äôre beautiful and elegant. They are very versatile and can easily be worn with evening attire to casual attire and however you choose to wear them. The earrings are also comfortable and that‚Äôs one of the requirements for me. The chain that comes with the pendant is very small/narrow/thin and the clasp is as well. I have already have a different chain and a choker that I will use the pendant on. I highly recommend the pendant and the earrings.

Earrings were so lovely. Wore them to a wedding which upped the style of my dress. Thank you!
"Gorgeous Earrings! Very unique which is what I look for...modern, different, very interesting. Great quality and beautiful craftsmanship. I just got them so haven‚Äôt worn them yet but sure they will be a conversation starter at any party! Thank you Shira Zinger! Beautifully wrapped with care instructions, a polishing cloth and a handwritten thank you note from the artist included."
When I saw these I just had to buy them! They are so different and look so great on. They are not heavy either. Love them.
"Superbes boucles offertes √† ma s≈ìur pour son No√´l, elle est ravie. üòâ"
Earrings absolutely gorgeous!
Nice pieces. Easy to wear with just about everything!
LOVE these earrings! And I was even gifted a cute letter ‚Äúe‚Äù ring complimentary with my order. Love the simple aesthetic and shipped surprisingly fast to the US!
Package arrived on time and the packaging was super cute! I love the earrings and they look great on! Would definitely buy more jewlry from this shop!
I ordered three of these in different styles. It comes as a single. I had some confusion when I was trying to make my selection and the shop owner helped me and updated the listing. I was so happy to find these. They shipped and arrived quickly. Thank you!!!

"I got 2 (B and D). Compare to B, I like this one. The top is not loose, not easy to fall off."
I just got this in the mail today and I really like it! It‚Äôs so unique and pretty and took less than a week to arrive ü•∞
Love everything I ordered...so cute! Looking forward to wearing it all!!!
These are so beautiful. I haven't worn any other pair of earrings since I got these. I love them.
"These are a bit smaller than I thought, and actually a better size than I expected. So unique and made well, not flimsy, but not thick either. I find people staring at my ears when I wear them! Thank you!"
These are my new favorite pair of earrings! Absolutely gorgeous!
Beautiful earrings that will look great on my wedding day!
"really really pretty. the seller even customized the chain length free of charge so that I could layer it with other pieces. unfortunately, the length I requested is a tad too long, but that's my bad! I requested a 21 inch chain but 20 would have been better!"
Exactly as ordered. Heavier than I'd anticipated. I think they are a very unique addition to my jewelry collection.
Absolutely stunning earrings! Worked perfectly for the wedding I was part of.
Parfaite! Je les adore! Merci!
Les boucles d'oreilles sont tellement jolies! Je les adore! Merci beaucoup √† l'artisane qui est une perle! Je recommande vraiment cette boutique!
J'adore ces boucles d'oreilles! Elles sont super bien faites. J'ai re√ßu tr√®s rapidement et elles √©taient emball√©es avec soin. Le service offert par Genevieve est super!
This year sweeps are gorgeous they are finished so well that you can't tell you have them in super comfortable and very fast shipping thank you so much for these I will be back
"Beautiful unusual earring, sits comfortably in the ear, eye catching design, very happy with purchase, would buy from this seller again."
Gorgeous piece. Very well made.
Beautiful. I love it. Thank you.
"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
I absolutely love these earrings. The stone stud is the perfect size and I love the detail on the circles. I want them in onyx too!
Suited my wedding dress perfectly.
These are fantastic - I love them! They arrived fast and beautifully packaged! Can't wait to order more from this store!
Great quality and fast delivery. Thank you so much!
"Another stunning earring from Lycia, always the most beautiful colour. Lots of interesting, original jewellery to be found here."
Bought two pairs of those in size M and XL. Very good quality! Very happy with it and now buying in size L too :) On the photo is XL one.
"the ruby and pink gold ear cuff is really stunning! A little hard getting it in but, once it's in it stays there until you take it off ( which is easy ). Thank you for making such beautiful ear cuff. I have a third one on it's way to me now! Highly recommend!"
Perfect! I love them and the seller was amazing. I will be back! Worth the price and the wait! I will upload pics at a later time but I assure you they are beautiful.
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
"When I ordered the ring, the listing said it would take a few weeks to arrive, but we received it in 8 days! I had to wait almost 2 weeks before Etsy would leave a review, that's how fast it shipped. The ring itself is perfect, it's very light compared to a lot of modern men's rings and the comfort fit edge is very smooth. It's a little small but that's my fault for not accommodating my fiance's knuckles. We're going to take it to a local jeweler to be sized because that issue is not Pompeii's fault. Definitely recommend using these guys if you're looking for a men's ring."
"These earrings are so well made and my sisters LOVE them! This seller is helpful, polite, and custom made these for me as he had sold out of this particular design. Once lockdown had eased they were promptly delivered - and they came with a free gift which was completely unexpected! Would order from this shop again!"
"L'article correspond √† mes attentes. Il a √©t√© exp√©di√© rapidement, et accompagn√© d'un petit cadeau. Totalement satisfaite de mon achat."
Ce sont de superbes boucles d'oreille
üíô Beautiful dragon! I will use it as a necklace!
Tr√®s jolies BO. J'aime leur √©l√©gance et la finesse du travail du fil d'argent. La livraison a √©t√© ultra rapide dans un emballage tr√®s s√©curis√© + un bel √©crin pour les prot√©ger. Merci √† sheilandi pour son professionnalisme.
This bracelet was perfect. It came in a lovely presented box with ribbon and frills. The piece itself looked just like the pictures. It was beautiful and a great gift for my girlfriend. I would rate the quality of work highly.
"elles sont magnifiques , envoi rapide et service apr√®s vente super! merci encore"
"tr√®s beau cadeau pour ma soeur, merci"
These are for my daughter so I can't really comment on the style as I don't get the octopus thing. They are sturdy and well made. I'm sure she will like them.
Love them! I wear them all the time.
Love the earrings. Delivery was longer than expected but everything is being delayed this past few weeks.
Great seller! Would definitely buy from again.
"So my style. Edgy, yet minimalist chic and elegant. I honestly think these are my dream earrings. These were shipped the day after the order; thankfully the swift travel from Valencia to NYC only took a week! (I am in gratitude of Ohana, the postal services, and lucky stars.) Anyway. Tremendous thanks for such professionalism and talent in sharing SUCH an insanely beautiful piece. Xoxo."
I am in love with these earrings. I get so many compliments. I plan on buying more!
Fast shipping to Australia. Great quality. Previously bought these in rose gold and loved them so much I needed them in silver :P Love!
I received my silver spike earring jackets today and I love them! They are of beautifully crafted quality and my lobes fit perfectly in the hole furthest away from the spikes. Thank you so much for a great buying experience. I'll be back to buy more :)

These are so pretty on - very delicate and totally unique. Shipping is fast and packaging is beautiful. I lost one down a sink and immediately ordered another pair as these have become my go to earrings for date night. Absolutely beautiful!
"I absolutely love these earrings, I bought them for prom and they look amazing."
Love them. I wanted ear jacket chain earrings for a while. These are perfect. Look trendy and stylish
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"

"OMG, I just love this new piece! I guessed the size that was possibly the same as the jewelry I had on; the size of the jewelry was close enough. PERFECT FIT and exactly what I expected it to be. This was also VERY EASY to put on (I had it on in seconds). As always, fast shipping and great customer service! Thank you BC, I'm stocking up my jewelry box to switch my jewelry out. PS. I pierced my tragus today:)"
"I. AM. OBSESSED. I love everything about this shop. I just got a bridge piercing about 2 months ago and I was ready to change the bar to something beautiful, but I had questions on sizing, etc. I messaged the seller and we had a lovely conversation about what would be the proper size for me, and whether I should opt for a straight or curved bar. They answered ALL my questions promptly, professionally, and kindly! Not only did they meet my expectations, they EXCEEDED them. Shipping was RIDICULOUSLY fast, the bar is beautiful, and they threw in an extra piece of jewelry to make up for the fact that they didn't have an extra straight bar of the size I requested! I'm in love, I have a new favorite shop, and I will DEFINITELY be recommending to friends <3 Thank you thank you thank you!!!!"
"These are absolutely beautiful! I, unfortunately, didn't screw one of the balls on tight enough and it fell out within the first 24 hrs. I messaged the seller immediately who sold me a discounted ball and shipped it within a day. I haven't had an issue since. Would highly recommend!"
"Beautiful blue colour, so many compliments and have sent people towards this shop. 8 or 10mm is perfect for the daith, will be ordering another when my second daith is healed"
She promptly made a replacement earring when I was an idiot and wore these gorgeous earrings without backs. She even threw in backs for me with the replacement!!! SO GRATEFUL because I LOVE these earrings!!! üòç
"Tr√®s jolie boucles d'oreilles, je suis ravie. Commande arriv√©e rapidement, bien emball√©e....parfait pour moi! Merci."
"Beautifully made, exceptional quality, mailed quickly with excellent communication!!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Thank you! Matches the studs I purchased previously exactly!
"Noa, Please allow me to commend you on your craftsmanship and style. My partner proposed to me in Maui under a waterfall and I was overcome by the beauty of this ring. I wanted a ring that was simple yet sophisticated, this ring fits the bill 100 %. Amazing. - Buyer - I bought this ring for my fiance! I was on short notice, and Noa was simply amazing. I had crazy travel plans where we changed shipping from Puerto Rico to San Francisco to Hawaii. The craftsmanship and classic style of this ring is unbelievable. Customer service is unbelievable. If I ever need anything else made, I know where I'm going. Sorry for the 22 emails and multiple calls - but I appreciate you making my moment PERFECT. If you're ever in San Francisco, you're welcome to stay with us! Thank you Noa."
"I highly recommend this sophisticated unique wedding band. After months of searching, most of what I found was mundane and generic. I wanted something intricate and detailed yet subtle. I ordered the ring and requested a rushed delivery. The ring came well before my deadline. Noah, emailed me and kept me informed throughout the process. The ring came well packaged with lots of personal touches. It was delightful! The ring fit exactly to the size specified and is very comfortable. I love the ring! Couldn't be happier."
"I love the simplicity of this piece. I threaded it through my first, second and third holes and I love how it sparkles in the sunlight! 10/10 would recommend !"
Je suis ravie de mon collier üòç! Il va apporter une touche de fra√Æcheur et d‚Äôoriginalit√© √† mes tenues ! Il est vraiment chouette ! ü§© Un sinc√®re MERCI pour le code promo gliss√© avec le collier ! üòä A tr√®s bient√¥t avec grand plaisir !

Une jolie guirlande avec un petit cadeau dans le paquet Merci
"The crawlers are great. They shipped in time and came in good packaging. The only concern I have it when I‚Äôm taking it off, I‚Äôm scared I might snap it. Overall, these are very cute!"
Very cute and looked just like what I expected! Shipping was very quick and the item packaging was very cute as well! Seem a little flimsy but still very nice.
Unique & perfect! Arrived quickly & nicely packaged. Thank you!
Very cute every day earrings! I love the simplicity.
She promptly made a replacement earring when I was an idiot and wore these gorgeous earrings without backs. She even threw in backs for me with the replacement!!! SO GRATEFUL because I LOVE these earrings!!! üòç

"Beautifully made, exceptional quality, mailed quickly with excellent communication!!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
Too cute ü•∞
"At first I was disappointed, I bought this to wear as an anklet but it‚Äôs a little bit too small. I added some of my own extra chain and it‚Äôs PERFECT!! Seriously the cutest evil eye anklet everüßø"
"I absolutely love these! They are a little bit more tiny than I expected but that‚Äôs okay, I love them just the way they are! They are real silver, I did a couple of at home tests to confirm it and I have extremely sensitive skin, so if they weren‚Äôt real silver I couldn‚Äôt wear them for long periods of them. I have been wearing them for a little over 48 hours and my ears are fine! I highly recommend those, they are super cute, great quality and got here (Canada) very quickly! ü•∞ü¶ïü¶ñ"
I LOVE my ear stud earring! They're unique and cute.
Beautifully made pearl ear climbers! Lovely pearls accompanied by a lovely note! Thank you!
"The bracelet is so beautiful, it looks even better in person! It looks dainty and delicate and just how I wanted. The owner was really nice and had answered all of my questions about sizing and shipping. For reference, my wrist size is about 14cm and I ordered size 5.5in. Overall, as my first order from Etsy, I am super impressed!"
"The seller was so nice and helpful! I also loved loved loved my necklace. It‚Äôs so unique and beautiful. I‚Äôm looking to purchase more just because I absolutely LOVE pearls but am tired of seeing the same design everywhere else, this store is so different and beautiful and not much of it is what I‚Äôve seen before so I appreciate the authenticity. The shipping took a while but it‚Äôs an international order so I guess I should‚Äôve expected that but other than that 5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è"
The earrings are beautiful. I purchased style A&B. Excellent customer service and the lovely handwritten note was an elegant touch. Highly Recommended!
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
"I bought these for my elopement wedding and I could not be more impressed! They are stunning in size and quality. The ship time was super quick even from Israel to DC in a pandemic. Thank you so much, you made me feel like a princess on my special day."
So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
Absolutely beautiful! So pleased with this earrings. Perfect for my wedding day.
Absolutely love those earnings!!!! I was looking for something unique and I found it. They are nicely made and come in adorable packaging that can also be storage box for them. I love the fact that you can rotate tiny wind mills like you would in real life :) Overall fast delivery. Top notch. I recommend the seller.
I am absolutely in love with these! They're exactly as I imagined. I would definitely buy from this seller again!
So special!
"Such cute earrings! I ordered silver, however when I received them they were gold with purple pinwheels. However I just bought some paint from Ben Franklin and painted the pinwheels blue and the sticks silver, to match my wedding colors. n nThe pinwheels actually spin - SO CUTE! Love these earrings. n nAlso fast shipping. Great work! :)"
These earrings are perfect with my ring from Raindrops; and I have also found an adorable fish pendant with another charoite for its' body! Thank you so much. SM
These are the best lapis lazuli earrings I‚Äôve ever seen. The design is stylish and the color is stunning. I like how substantial and obviously well-made they are. There are also some nice little finishing touches that I appreciate. They go great with a lapis lazuli ring I have and I get lots of compliments wearing them together. Thank you!
"These earrings are gorgeous and fun, the stones are beautiful! I love lemon quartz! They look exactly like the photo. I ordered several items and the order shipped right away! The seller was easy to reach with questions. Everything on the site is unique."
"I ordered earrings in early December. My package seems to have been lost in the mail somewhere between CA and NY. I originally thought I might have been involved in yet another internet scam, however the seller was quick to respond to my frustration and assure me that the matter was under investigation. I truly hope the earring arrive soon, as they were truly the ones that I wanted. After a long wait due to post office delays; I FINALLY received my earrings! What a sweet relief! They are stunning, packaged beautifully, and are perfect for my friend! Exactly how they were advertised! Elena is a dedicated, wonderful vendor. She went out of her way to file a claim with the post office for me and it paid off!! I will ABSOLUTELY return to her shop in the future and recommend her without hesitation!"
"Those are beautiful earrings and conform to the photo ! The only thing is, they are asymmetrical and I would have liked it for it to be more obvious, but oh, they are so very cute. They come with stops in order to not lose them."
Merci infiniment ! Clous d'oreilles parfaits pour compl√©ter mon pr√©c√©dent achat. ma fille est plus que ravie. Et merci pour le cadeau √©galement ... Je suis tr√®s touch√©e. :-)
This was a holiday present for a dear friend of mine. She loves cats and her own cat is an orange tabby. I wanted to get her something that would always remind her of her fluffy buddy. Shipping time was about as expected for an international order (shipped from france all the way to california). It arrived safely and she adores it.
"Vielen Dank f√ºr die sehr sch√∂nen Ohrringe! Es ist zwar nicht so ganz einfach, sie anzulegen, aber mit der Zeit hat man den Dreh bestimmt raus! ;-) Ich bin auf jeden Fall begeistert! Danke und vielleicht bis zum n√§chsten Mal! :-)"
"Very nice earrings, beautiful design. Order was delayed due to COVID, but Kelly worked very hard to get items through the postal service. Kelly is very responsive-great customer service!"
"Lovely earrings, thanks so much!"
"This earring goes perfectly with the Herkimer diamond one from Mirta on the other ear. It wears comfortably, and as you can see from the photo, the earring stops just where my outer ear edge starts to curl. I love it!"
I am completely happy and in love with my earrings! I have found different ways to sport them. Thank you!!!
Although these earrings came all the way from Croatia they made their way to me. I absolutely love them. So unique and perfect! I will definitely order more items from this company.
Hvala!
Best earrings I've ever owned! I get compliments ever time I wear them. I love that my hair never gets tangled in them.
"Cute earrings, very unique and delicate"
can't wait to wear them! Thanks!
"Love, love, love. This pair is well made, unique, BEAUTIFUL, versatile, chic and sexy! Leave it to the French! It's everything a woman can ask for! It's great for work and for play. I have gotten compliments everywhere. The fact that it's got both silver, gold AND ROSE gold tones on it means it gets a lot of mileage in the my wkly rotation. Will be sharing the name of the shop next time I'm asked! This was shipped FAST w/tracking and packaged ready to gift. SUPER PLEASED. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SHOP!!!"
These were just as pictured! I can't wait to give them to my wedding day helper as a thank you!
"J'ai command√© ces boucles pour ma meilleure amie adoratrice de cuir et de boucles d'oreilles et elles les ADORE ! Elles sont exactement comme sur la photo, tr√®s jolies et de belle qualit√© !

Design conforme aux photos Tr√®s chouette !!
Tres belle!! Du qualitie superieur. Tous les bijoux ici sont parfaits! Je reviens encore (and encore).
"I LOVE THIS SHOP! I ordered 3 items from here. For a start, all my questions were answered almost immediately after me contacting the seller - hardly any wait time. I requesting some modifications, all of which were happily accomodated. I paid for my items, and regardless of international shipping, received them shortly thereafter. On receiving them items, I LOVED THEM! They were just as beautiful in person as they were viewed online. I am so happy. I would highly recommend purchasing from this shop. Communication was fast and effective, and the jeweller does beautiful work."
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
"I bought these for my elopement wedding and I could not be more impressed! They are stunning in size and quality. The ship time was super quick even from Israel to DC in a pandemic. Thank you so much, you made me feel like a princess on my special day."
So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
Absolutely beautiful! So pleased with this earrings. Perfect for my wedding day.
"This is the coolest! I think the post is a little thicker than a conventional earring, because I have some trouble getting it in, but besides that I think these are fabulous. I got the climber in addition to a single star stud, and both earrings are well made, sturdy, and super light weight - I actually forget that I'm wearing them sometimes. They also come in the cutest little jar, which I'm saving to store them in. And Arajera also sends along a little thank you card with care instructions on it, which I really appreciate. Super pleased with my purchase! Thank you. :)"
"I love these earrings! They were a bit hard to get in the first day because I hadn't worn earrings in a few weeks and my holes had tightened up, and these are sliiightly thicker than my normal posts. I just wore my heaviest dangles for a few hours to stretch the holes a bit and the next day they went right in like a dream! They look so cute, I've wanted a pair of these for years so I'm so glad I finally got them!"
"The quality of the product is great! Just a couple of notes, though: I ordered it at the end of November and I received it in early January. (I live in the U.S.) I should have looked at the shipping details more closely- if you're ordering from the U.S, do prepare to wait a while. Also, I had previously stretched my ears; they've closed up now, but if you have larger piercing holes, prepare for this earring to jut out a bit when you wear it. Still looks nice, not too noticeable! Ara does great work. :)"
"Beautiful ear climber! Ordered the earring to wear on my left ear and it didn't fit quite how I wanted, but that's honestly because my ear lobes are very small. I tried it on my right ear, upside down, instead and it fits perfectly! Wonderful craftsmanship and packaging :)"
"These were a bit large for me and I also thought I'd like them better in gold filled, so I was very glad that Carl & Lynn were able to arrange an exchange. I'm thrilled with having a new style and my flat malachite studs edged in gold that I really didn't wear much look fantastic with them too. I've been buying their jackets since 2007 and have continued to do so because I find quality here at affordable prices and Carl & Lynn are a pleasure to work with. You won't be disappointed!"
Very nice. Will be able to use with many studs. Light weight.
"Very very beautifull jackets just forgot to buy the earrings, i didn't read it very well, but these jackets are allready very very TOP, just now have got to order the earrings, but great job to them and very happy I orderen 2 jackets :-)"
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.

"So beautifully crafted and wonderful conversation with the seller to make a small change to my piece. I love it and will be wearing it often. Thank you!! Broke the bank, but it was worth it lol"
Amazingly crafted. Fit's like a dream. She even did a custom design for me. So much care was put into the item as well as the transaction itself. I would love to buy more of your work.
"... and thanks a lot for this fantastic piece, it looks amazing and is very comfortable to wear! Whenever I wear this ear cuff people ask about it, it turns out to be quite the conversation piece!"
Thank you for this piece. I really love it!
I love the originality of the design. Sturdy but chic.
Love these earrings! They are such a cute and bold style and not too heavy so they are super comfortable to wear. Looking forward to having more places to wear them to one day!
Love the earrings - well made and a great design. The shop was very responsive and great to communicate with when I encountered some delivery issues. Would happily order from again.
I love these earrings. Chic and unique. #deltafemale. Silver is a soft metal so be sure to store them carefully. Make sure to use the plastic plugs or you will lose them!!
Unique and well-made. These are fun to wear.
"It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that‚Äôs to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!"
My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead- instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.
These are amazing!! Haha So pretty!!<3 I got them for my sister for Christmas and she's going to love them!! Great service!! <3 :)
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."
"Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy! I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently."
They look so beautiful! I love them. I'm so glad I got them! I'm in love üòç
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞

"I LOVE THIS SHOP! I ordered 3 items from here. For a start, all my questions were answered almost immediately after me contacting the seller - hardly any wait time. I requesting some modifications, all of which were happily accomodated. I paid for my items, and regardless of international shipping, received them shortly thereafter. On receiving them items, I LOVED THEM! They were just as beautiful in person as they were viewed online. I am so happy. I would highly recommend purchasing from this shop.

I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
"I have been looking a VERY long time for dangle diamond jackets. These are beautiful, unique and exactly what I was looking for! I love them."
"Very pretty earrings. I personally think they look prettier without the leaf detail (which looks a little cheap/thin). Nevertheless, happy with my purchase. Handling and shipping was swift."
"Die Ohrringe waren sehr sch√∂n und sehr schnell geschickt, das hat mich gefreut. Aber leider war die Geschenkoption komplett vergessen, also keine Nachricht zu der Packung, die f√ºr mich ziemlich wichtig war (es war ein Geburtstaggeschenk)! Trotzdem danke."
Ich habe schon so einiges bei Villa Sorgenfrei bestellt und bin jedes mal wieder begeistert. Jedes Schmuckst√ºck ist besonders:) Schnelle und unkomplizierte Lieferung
So beautiful!
"I received my moon phase ear climbers pretty quickly! It's sooooo beautiful! I'm wore it immediately after opening my package. You do have to adjust the wire, but that's not a problem to me! Overall, I LOVE IT! Thank you sooo much!"
"Jordan customized this ring for me and I received it in less than a week. Sweet packaging, too. She responds very quickly to inquiries and does it cheerfully so communication is a pleasure. This is absolutely the most perfect pinky ring. So comfortable and it makes a statement on your hand. It will complement any silver ring you wear with it. I‚Äôm thrilled. This is now a favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è shop and favorite seller"
Hermoso..!!!
"My blue labradorite ring is great! The color range is shimmery gray to a striking electric blue; the cut really enhances the glow. The ring fits perfectly and it's very comfortable to wear. Jordan was very helpful to work with, she provided pictures of available stones and made sure that I got the right color. I highly recommend this Artisan!"
"Shipped Super fast items just as great as described, recommend seller if looking for chains, charms etc...the prices are good and the seller is great"
These oval wavy earring post are beautiful with excellent quality are arrived earlier than expected.
I really like to work with and wear these shorter hooks !Great and fast service ! Thank you !
"Shipped Super fast items just as great as described, recommend seller if looking for chains, charms etc...the prices are good and the seller is great"

Look great! They‚Äôre going to be a present for my sister and I just know she‚Äôll love them! They arrived really quickly and came is a cute pouch.
SO BEAUTIFUL üòç I am in LOVE with this look! All the way from Spain to Florida in a cute package with a personalized noteüí´üí´üí´
Total class. Simply adore these. Best earrings I have ever bought.
"I absolutely love Virginia's designs - they are simple, elegant, striking, and unique all at once. I purchased several pairs of earrings because I just couldn't pick a favorite. I cannot wear any of them without getting compliments. I'm sure I'll treat myself with more her beautiful pieces in the future and will recommend this shop to anyone who asks in the meantime. Thanks so much!"
Simply.Adorable.Period. Only piece of jewelry I have ever gotten compliments on.
"This has become my favorite place to get ""real"" jewelry. Amazing design (I can't find anything else like it) and quality product (stands up to daily wear). I now (happily) own @ 20 pieces of Virginia Wynne's work."
"I absolutely adore these earrings! They are so unique, what a clever idea. I have not been disappointed by anything I have purchased from VirginiaWynne. I intend to make more purchases from this site in the future."
I'm one of the people who like Rosely's work and want to buy her entire store :) This one is great too!
"I received a lot of compliments on this pair of earrings. The picture didn't do it justice. It's absolutely more beautiful in person. The crystals and the faceted stones are shiny, in a subtle way, which I like very much. The whole piece is elegant. It quickly became my new favorite."
Love love love!!these earrings are sooo beautiful and sooo well made and un usual.im goin to order another pair.amazing!!thanku soooooo much.
"I‚Äôm absolutely in love with these gorgeous earrings! Due to health reasons I had to let go of my pierced ears and to be honest it wasn‚Äôt until I saw these gorgeous earrings I was ok with it. They look even more gorgeous in real life and feels like a real treasure! ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm hoping for more earrings similar to this in your shop, I‚Äôm obsessed with mine and would love to buy more later. I‚Äôve also had several compliments for them üôèüèª Thank you endlessly for these beauties, I‚Äôll wear them with pride üå∏"
"Absolutely beautiful! The quality is incredible. If I could make one recommendation... Since the ring is adjustable, of the ends could be made in such a way as to cover the tails and noses of the fish. Those edges are sharp and cut into my finger. I have an idea of how to do that but can't draw you a picture here."
"Sicher verpackt und schnell verschickt kam dieses h√ºbsche Schmuckst√ºck bei mir an. Zwar fiel der Anh√§nger etwas dunkler aus als gedacht, aber das mindert den Eindruck keineswegs. Die liebevollen Details sind f√ºr die Gr√∂√üe sehr gut erkennbar und beide Gesichter sind einfach nur sch√∂n, jawoll! Allerdings wurde ich - nach dem Kompliment √ºber meinen sch√∂nen neuen Anh√§nger! ‚ô• - von einer Freundin gefragt, wieso der MOND denn ausgerechnet goldfarben w√§re, ob das nicht besser zur Sonne passen w√ºrde und ob es diesen Anh√§nger eventuell in Silber geben w√ºrde. (Hab sie auf die Villa Sorgenfrei / auf Etsy verwiesen!) Ich bin jedenfalls voll und ganz zufrieden mit meinem janus-gesichtigen Mond! ‚ô•"
"Wundersch√∂ner, zierlicher Ring. Ich liebe ihn. Gr√∂√üe passt super nach kurzer R√ºcksprache. Schneller Versand."
wundersch√∂ner Ring !
Je les adore! Elles sont tr√®s belles!

Beautiful earrings! They‚Äôre exactly as described. I love them already :)
"Wundersch√∂n, sehen aus wie in der Beschreibung! Super schnelle Lieferung."
"tolles Design, schnelle Lieferung, netter Kontakt"
The item itself is beautiful. The shop owner was very nice and quick to respond. I took away one star because I think she should be more upfront about how long shipping will take. I ordered the item which took a month to arrive. It came passsed the date I needed it for. Overall good experience but I believe a better expectation could have been set. Thanks!
"A Masterpiece Set - earrings and necklace - simply beautiful. I love the colors, the style and the feel of this set. Superb! Superb!! Superb!!! Superior style, sale, and shipping! Stars Set!! YES indeed!!"
"Collier tr√®s fin et magnifique.Il me plait encore plus en vrai qu'en photo!Il est tr√®s l√©g√®rement paillet√© ce qui attire l‚Äô≈ìil sans le rendre ""bling bling"" Port√© pour un mariage , il a fait son petit effet ! La mari√©e elle m√™me m'a compliment√©e. Re√ßu dans les temps indiqu√©s .Produit, temps de r√©alisation et d'exp√©dition, contact avec la cr√©atrice:tout a √©t√© parfait.Merci beaucoup."
"Tr√®s contente de ma commande, boucles d'oreilles parfaitement conformes √† la description, colis soign√©. Tout est parfait !"
"I absolutely love my my ear cuff. It fits snugly and I don‚Äôt have to worry about it falling off. It‚Äôs so comfortable I actually went to sleep with it on not realizing I had been wearing it until the next morning. The shipping and delivery service was prompt. If you‚Äôre looking for a non-piercing ear cuff, look no further. This is the best quality ear cuff I have purchased."
Exactly as pictured and look great with my stud earrings. Shipped quickly.
Rather large and hurts for long term wear as the hoop part is very tight (even after I stretched it with pliers) and very heavy. Perfect gauge size though so might use it for Halloween/cosplay.
Beautiful item! Quick shipping. Will order again.
"Excellent scent, shipped on time, great seller"
"Wow are these gorgeous! I‚Äôm a minimalist and picky about what goes into my closet. I‚Äôve searched for a few years and finally found the perfect piece. They‚Äôre light, well-crafted, extremely stylish. Very happy customer!"
"it`s love. :o) my expectations were already high, just unpacked them and they are even prettier than I could imagine. Thank you, Meytal!!"
Davvero stupendo! L'ho regalato a mia moglie per San Valentino e le √® piaciuto tantissimo!
Gorgeously beautiful ear climbers. As much as I ordered few more for my daughter and myself. The note attached is heartwarming üíï Thank you!
Gorgeous glittery ear climbers! Simple to put on and looks great on the ears.
I have very sensitive ears so I‚Äôm always hesitant with new jewelry. I‚Äôve had these in all evening and I don‚Äôt have the faintest reaction! Highly recommend.
Looks exactly as pictured! Love love love it! The metal is also easily manipulated which is great for my small ears.
I absolutely LOVE this piece of jewelry! I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on it. :)
"So delicate and beautiful! Absolutely love this. Took me a little bit to figure out the perfect placement, but now that I know it will be easy when I wear it in the future."
I love it!
"I love this so much, there absolutely beautiful and their exactly what I thought they would be. I have never had the style of earring before so I didn't really know how to put them on, But now that I have them on I am in love!!thank you Tiff and Micah"
Out-by-God-stounding. Love these earrings. Get the 7 stones. They curve EXACTLY how they're supposed to on my ears. Have no doubt they will be my every day earrings. Will be ordering from this shop again. Stones are super iridescent. Worth the wait.
"Completely obsessed! I've received so many compliments and I can barely feel them in my ear. I typically can't wear earrings for more than a few hours, but I've worn these all day and absolutely love them!"
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
I previously ordered the matching earrings and now I have the pendant in the rose gold color. They‚Äôre beautiful and elegant. They are very versatile and can easily be worn with evening attire to casual attire and however you choose to wear them. The earrings are also comfortable and that‚Äôs one of the requirements for me. The chain that comes with the pendant is very small/narrow/thin and the clasp is as well. I have already have a different chain and a choker that I will use the pendant on. I highly recommend the pendant and the earrings.
Beautiful...dainty but still noticeable. I‚Äôve had many compliments. Shipping was super fast. No issues with the product or the seller. Very happy customer ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"El collar es precioso, super finito y delicado. Parece que es de muy buena calidad tambi√©n. Lleg√≥ bastante antes de lo previsto y muy bien empaquetado. ¬°Me encanta!"
$35 and it‚Äôs already broken....not happy.
"All our pieces leave our workshop in perfect condition, we do not know what use this piece has had afterwards, by the client, nobody has had problems with this piece."
This truely is a beautiful necklace. It has brought me so much happiness to wear something so simple yet elegant! Thank you.
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
"Cute earrings, I love them!!"
My star earrings are too cuute!!
"I wanted a small pair of hoops I can wear everyday & not take out. I contemplated getting the 10mm, but so glad I got the 12mm, they‚Äôre perfect!!! I ordered them early Monday morning & got them the next day!!!"
"I‚Äôm very satisfied with this purchase. It‚Äôs a delicate well made chain, perfect for those who likes minimalist simple jewelry pieces. In my case I paired it with an evil eye üßø pendant and they go perfectly together. The necklace gives the optical illusion as if the pendant is floating from far which is exactly what I wanted. This chain is also very sparkly!!! What else can I say... I love it ü•∞ Thank you üòä"
I'm incredibly thrilled with this ring! First time ordering with Zircon - this is my new go to for jewellery for exceptionally well crafted product with lustrous shine. I love bold rings with a realistic look and fee. This ring meets all my needs! Ordered a size 6 and fits very comfortably!
"Gorgeous ear cuff! I saw this on the site and it was not in stock. Vivi was excellent in communicating with me and when she got it in, she let me know and I ordered it. So happy I waited to get it. Shipped quickly in a cute leopard box, is beautifully made with excellent little sparkly cz stones, sits snugly on my ear, and is simply quite an elegant little piece of jewelry. LOVE IT!!"
"Smaller than I was expecting but they are absolutely stunning, good quality and I am beyond satisfied‚ù§"
It is honestly a great ring. Nice quality and you can't beat the price. Although it didn't work out for me (my ring didn't fit well with it) I highly recommend this shop!
Came right on time and was amazing!! I got so many compliments and a child even tried to steal it off me it was so beautiful. Worth it üòä
"I received these earcuffs and love them! Nice fit, nice weight, nice color. I even forgot to take one off before I went to sleep and it stayed on all night, while being comfy enough I didn't even feel it was on."
larger than i expected but i was planning on getting a fourth piercing in my lobe anyway so it all worked out.
I love my earrings and got so many compliments on them. Sophia is the best!
"I only just received these gorgeous earrings today. They are exactly as pictured, and better. They are the perfect size (not too big so they don't look chunky, and not too long that they keep falling). They are also a lovely colour against my olive complexion. I can't wait to wear these out. Thank you Ohana Jewels I must say I am a big fan of your jewellery and will no doubt be ordering from you again. Xx"
"Boucles d‚Äôoreilles similaires √† la photo. Elles sont √©l√©gantes et change d‚Äôune perceuse simple, j‚Äôadore ! Avec un chignon √ßa sera parfait :) je me r√©jouis des les porter √† mon mariage."
Beautiful jewelry! Fast delivery! Amazing customer service! Thank you Beatriz!
One of my favourite pieces of jewellery Love these earrings! Shop very easy to deal with and beautifully packaged
"Thank You for changing my order for me , I really appreciate it. The ear crawlers are really pretty!"
"Amazing, I'll wear them in special occasions."
"The seller was helpful and definitely ensured my order arrived on time for a wedding! I was so surprised at how quick it reached me. The earrings were exactly as pictured. A very small con was that I expected the earring backing to be silver too for the price and not a silicone one. None the less, they fit and sit well :) will be back again!"
"I opened the package and audibly gasped when I saw how gorgeous these earrings were! I wanted earrings that were edgy, unique, yet classically beautiful to wear for my wedding day and I think I found them!"
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
Absolutely stunning! It was exactly what I needed to give a little edge to my classic wedding look. Also the customer service was super responsive.
The seller was very prompt at shipping. Let me tell you the ear cuffs are gorgeous and I would definitely recommend this shop for anyone. I was very skeptical as to how a simple lobe clip will hold entire cuffs weight onto ear. I had lot of problems keeping ear cuffs in position. These cuffs are light in weight and clip on lobe holds everything in place. Love it
This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are
"A great little chain to add an accent piercing to my ear! Super light weight and has not tarnished. I‚Äôve worn this pretty much everyday and into the shower as well and it still looks as delicate as when I first got it! I have the length 25mm here and I have very small ears. I would definitely recommend getting 30 mm if you‚Äôre thinking of using this for a conch piercing or a helix piercing so that it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äústrangle‚Äù or cut into your ear. Definitely my own fault that I didn‚Äôt get a longer chain, but it still looks very cute with the current placement I think!"
Lovely products! Quality handmade pieces. Packed beautifully and with care. Shop has excellent and rapid communication. Definitely recommend :)

"Superbe collier, je l'ai re√ßu dans les temps. Trop contente de mon achat üòâüòä"
I love this pendant. It is so unusual and I very much enjoy it's distinct form and colors.
"Je suis ravie, tout est parfait"
"C'est tr√®s joli, livr√© rapidement et avec soin, merci"
I was so thrilled with the cute packaging that this beautiful bracelet came in. It came in a very nice bracelet case wrapped in beautiful lace and also came with a reusable bag (which I use all the time now!) The bracelet is just as described and is even more shiny in person. I receive compliments on this bracelet all the time. Shipping was on time and everything was packaged securely. Great seller! I will definitely shop here again. Thank you!
"Le bijou est exactement comme d√©crit, ma copine en est tr√®s contente !! Tr√®s bon service de Thessyworldparis, je vous en remercie Thessyworldparis. Je ne peux que recommender ! - - Exactly as described, my girlfriend was really pleased. I recommend. Thank you very much."
Elles sont vraiment jolies ces boucles d'oreille. Tr√®s bon service et livraison rapide comme d'habitude de la part de Thessy. Un gros Merci!
"Boucles d'oreilles qui sont conformes √† la photo et √† leur description. Expedition un peu retard√©e par rapport √† la date de la commande, mais elles sont bien arriv√©es et elles me plaisent !"
"Ana kept in contact with me and informed of the status of my earrings through this whole pandemic nightmare that she was trying to ship through from Spain to my tiny little speck in the middle of the Pacific Ocean called Oahu, Hawaii. She felt terrible but this is no one‚Äôs fault right now, we have to stick together, it‚Äôs a new world and we have to learn how to maneuver through it. Personally, I‚Äôm gonna be nice about it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

Absolutely love my red jasper and silver necklace. It is pretty and eye catching. It arrived quickly and was beautifully packaged. The addition of a card and personalised pack of seeds to plant was a lovely touch. I have planted the seeds and they have sprouted. Thanks Ana
I‚Äôm so in love with this earring Its so beautiful and well made. I highly recommend.
"Ich habe lange auf meinen Schmuck. Am 10.04. bestellt, angeblich 1-2 Wochen Lieferzeit, am 24.4. angeblich verschickt. Ich schreibe ""angeblich"", weil in Etsy unter Eink√§ufe bis zuletzt ""Vor Versand"" zu lesen war. Am 11.05. ist der Schmuck endlich eingetroffen, ob die Verz√∂gerung wegen der Pandemie eingetreten ist oder nicht kann ich nicht sagen. Eigenartig war es auf jeden Fall! Meine Korrespondenz wurde innerhalb einiger Tage bearbeitet und beantwortet. Diese Ohrringe und das Armband sind sch√∂n anzusehen, aber qualitativ gefallen sie mir nicht. Die Klappcreole schlie√üt nur mit einem ""bitte"" und ich f√ºrchte, sie wird definitiv irgendwann den Ohrring frei geben, ob ich will oder nicht. Beide sind f√ºr meinen Geschmack zu leicht, sie f√ºhlen sich nicht wie vergoldetes Silber an. Der Preis scheint gerecht, mehr Wert ist er nicht."
Fast international shipping. So beautifully made I can barely tell the difference between this bracelet and my solid gold ones.
"Bonjour, Je suis tr√®s satisfaite ! Vu le prix j‚Äôen reviens tout simplement pas ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä Conforme √† la photo. D√©lais de livraison satisfaisant. Je commanderai √† nouveau üëç"
It‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. It‚Äôs such a dainty ring and I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it.
"These earrings were worth the wait!! I‚Äôve had my eye on them for a while and I‚Äôm so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn‚Äôt the shop‚Äôs fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times."
Absolutely gorgeous! I've received lots of compliments. Fast service.
Gorgeous earrings and they look exactly like the photos. I was worried that my ear lobes would be too small but they fit perfectly. Thank you!
These ear cuffs are beautiful and elegant! Very well made! They look very nice on the ear. Very comfortable to wear. Shipping was very quick. Would definitely buy from this seller again! They came in a very nice little bag made of soft material. Very pleased with purchase! Thank you for making these ear cuffs!
Beautiful! Worth every penny I love them!
So pretty and intricate. Arrived very quickly and wore them the next day.
Love the earrings! Wore them on my birthday today!
"Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day. Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!"
"Totally my favorite earrings. Such s great idea and they look just wonderful. Good quality and everyone always asks about them and compliments them. Finding this product has totally gotten me into looking and purchasing more science inspired jewelry, I love it!"
"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!
Absolutely love them!!!
Very cute set! I just have very narrow edges i guess but i do still love the look!!!
"This is my second purchase; I have already purchase this item in silver, and I liked it so much, I ordered one in gold."
These earrings quickly turned from gold to silver after only wearing them a couple of times. So sad because I really liked them. I‚Äôm not very optimistic that another pair would be better. This was my first purchase from this shop so I‚Äôm hesitant to buy more. :/
"These are just gorgeous and even more beautiful irl than the picture. The seller is really helpful and friendly. I cannot recommend these highly enough, I've had several people ask me about them when I wear them and I have happily passed on the seller's details. I will definitely be buying more items - for me and as presents - just as soon as I get a job..!"
"These earring are beautiful with intricate detail. Although we had a huge problem with the delivery arriving from Greece, Katia was super responsible and communicative in all of her attempts to resolve the issue with the overseas mailing (which was not her fault.) Very pleased with the results and will soon give them finally to their gift recipients!"
Love them! They look amazing and came in a beautiful little package with a personal note from the maker <3
Exquisite! So unique!
"Super c'est conforme √† la photo , d√©lai de livraison respect√© et puis je suis tr√®s satisfaite de mon choix."
Exquisite piece of beading. It used very small beads and is a lovely piece of jewellery.
Boucles d'oreilles tr√®s jolies. Satisfaite de mon achat.
jolies boucles d' oreilles pas trop grandes. merci beaucoup
Hi Kathy thanks so much for my beautiful earings they are stunning are can't wait to wear them! Very happy with my purchase! X
The earrings are sublime and I received a small gift even. üòç I highly recommend this shop!
So pretty! Love wearing these! :)
Beautiful earrings. I just love them!
Rings looked exactly like photos. First time I bought something that didn't disappoint on Etsy. Facets may seem a bit rough but I'm ok with it. The inside is very well made and comfortable. Only tricky bit is getting the size right. My size felt a bit loose so when I shower I have to be careful. This ring's design may be more well suited for women than for men. But this really depends on the man's style. Overall I'm pleased with the product and will not hesitate to recommend. Thanks!
"These earrings are quite literally, out of this world (hence, usually I have poor timing :))) you can waer time any time of year, for literally and occasional. The first day I wore them, I received more then 20 compliments!!! Soooo, thank you kindly !!!!"
"This ring is absolutely stunning! It's slim and dainty, but also so beautifully engraved that it is simply and perfectly elegant. My sister and I met for the first time in November of 2019 - I was adopted - and have grown close, so we wanted to get something to remember each other by since we live so far apart. These rings are precious mementos and are far more beautiful than the images can portray. On another note, this seller is a SAINT! He is beyond kind and patient. We royally screwed up the order by choosing the wrong size and the wrong gold color, but he worked with us until it was sorted. I cannot overstate this; Ran is absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much!"
My fiancee and I are so in love with our gorgeous wedding rings. They are actually much more beautiful in person and the details so intricate! The seller was incredibly attentive and kind; definitely a talented craftsman who takes pride in his work. Thank you so much for the prompt delivery and making our dream rings possible! We would absolutely make future purchases from this seller.
"Bought 2, one for me and one for a friend. They arrived quickly and we both love them! Very delicate and pretty. The size can be adjusted based on where you attach the clasp, which is good because we both have small wrists. Have gotten several compliments on this bracelet!"
These arrived quickly and I am pleased with them. I would love a pair just like them in a larger size too.
"Vraiment jolies et originales, elles sont robustes. J'aime la texture qui n'est pas lisse comme tout autre bijoux. Cela leurs donne un ""je ne sais quoi"" de particulier. Bravo! Service rapide."
"Tout simplement superbes! Service rapide, je recommande!"
"I love these earrings. They are perfect for everyday, and they don't bother my sensitive ears. I've gotten many compliments on too:)"
"Good quality, very comfortable, looks great"
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
Love! Love! Love! My purchase üòÅ The earrings are beautifully made and look really elegant and stylish. Will definitely be ordering again.
"Thank you so much, I bought these for my wedding and can‚Äôt wait to wear them! Great quality and I love the screw fit for the upper ear which makes the fit perfect and discreet, unlike other versions that use clips x"
I absolutely love these earrings. The quality and packaging is superb. I will definitely be ordering from this vendor again!!!!!
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! i recieved so many compliments. Thank you so much for the quick process and shipping. I‚Äôll definitely will be buying again
"Parfait, rien a dire, exp√©dition et livraison rapide, les articles sont superbes !"

"Totalement satisfaite, la couleur est jolie, je recommande !"
"Totalement satisfaite, parfait, je recommande !"
None of the stores here including Macy's have anything this unique and attractive. They are extremely well made and light and comfortable to wear. Beautiful earrings made by a fine artisan. Would definitely buy from Yael again.
Gorgeous earrings! I purchased these for my wedding and am very happy with the quality and the craftsmanship. The communication process was also excellent. :)
I just love this pearl drop necklace. I had something similar when I was young and it was lost. I finally found on your website.
"Beautiful, well made earrings! Very good communication from the seller - friendly and helpful."
Beautiful necklace. Great communication with seller.
"Perfect jewelry, made with love, looks even better than the picture."
"Perfect jewelry, made with love, looks even better than the picture."

Love my ear climbers! They‚Äôre so comfortable I forget that they were even in! Would definitely recommend!
Thanks.I love it!
"I was looking for everyday earrings that I can sleep and shower while wearing. These work. They were super tight, but I easily adjusted them, and now I forget I‚Äôm wearing them."
So lovely! arrived quickly. Very comfortable. I will ear them all the time!

Alles gut gelaufen. Perfekt. Danke
"I love this piece! It‚Äôs so cute! I will say that if you like leaving your jewelry in for long periods of time, you will need to like just go over the jewelry with like a cotton swab and something to clean it with. Gets kinda dirty fast for some reason! Will buy from this seller again. Lol I‚Äôm like super faded in the pic but it shows the jewelry so whatever lol"
"Shipping was incredibly fast. Ear crawler is very unique, just as pictured and and I am satisfied with this overall purchase. Thank you"
"I love the nose ring so much I ordered 4! Lol, for my double nostril and double helix."
my ears are beautifully decorated now :) My first ear climber and I am in LOVE
"I love love love the cuffs that come in this set! I wear them almost every day! I like the crawler earrings too, but my husband says it looks like I have staples in my ear lobe üòë. My one complaint is that when they arrived (all pieces), they were too tight to put on. I just stretched out the openings a bit though and now they are perfectly comfortable."
"Love this!!! Exactly what I wanted, it looks just like the picture showed. The whole set is very comfortable (and cuffs tend to hurt so I'm especially impressed with that) and I love the look of the set. I think its helpful to shift the cuffs until you find a spot on the ear where they feel that they are perfectly fitted and this way they wont get sore. Very happy with the set :)"
Love them!
Great products. Just as pictured. Beautiful earrings.
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
"Bought 2, one for me and one for a friend. They arrived quickly and we both love them! Very delicate and pretty. The size can be adjusted based on where you attach the clasp, which is good because we both have small wrists. Have gotten several compliments on this bracelet!"

"Absolutely beautiful ring, really pleased with it. But even better was the service, I was desperate to get it for a party I was attending so it was made and delivered within 48 hours, fantastic!"
"Lee is not only a phenomenal artist, but she saved Christmas! Thank you, Lee for going above and beyond to ensure it arrived on time, because it did! Oh yeah, and the piece is stunning! She loves it!!!"
"Absolutely LOVE my ring! Not only is the quality of the product amazing and so beautiful, Lee is so friendly! I ordered the wrong size and Lee was nice enough to re fit the ring with no issues what so ever. I would really commend ordering from her - I've already set my eyes on my next purchase ;)"
"Lovely ring. It is an everyday, substantial setting that is very well made. The snow agate is beautiful and of course unique. The seller sent pictures of four differerent stones for me to choose from. Please be patient as each ring is handmade to order. As a customer I felt that my order was supported throughout and that my custom was appreciated"

My wife loves these earrings.
"Really pretty ear climbers, the different sized stars and stones make them extra special. Excellent quality and very sturdy on the ear, so there's no danger of losing them. Very happy, many thanks!"
"I love it! I have to get used to the style but the design is amazing and it fits my finger. I love the raw stones!! Also the seller is cool, she checked in to make sure I received my item."
They are beyond what I expected. Just Beautiful and Thank you! I will be returning soon.
I wear a lot of stone cabochon necklaces with antique gold chains and I have a gold wedding ring. I find these earrings bring them together and compliment them nicely. They are pretty without being too fancy. Very pleased.
"This pair of earrings was a gift for my daughter's first Mother's Day (and her Feb birthstone is amethyst), so this lilac color was perfect for May! SO pretty and delicate. Super fast shipping. Very impressed..."
Tr√®s jolies ! je suis tr√®s contente de ces boucles d'oreilles ! Elles sont ravissantes.

I love these beautiful crawler earrings! They are the second pair of crawlers that I have purchased.AND..i have my eye on a few more. Very satisfied... With my purchases and the great customer service. Try a pair...you'll love them.
So lovely and delicate! Exactly what I wanted!
Love these. Beautiful color! Fast shipping
Got these earrings for a gift and she loved them! Prompt shipping
OBsessed with these! So many compliments and so well made. :)
"I love this so much, there absolutely beautiful and their exactly what I thought they would be. I have never had the style of earring before so I didn't really know how to put them on, But now that I have them on I am in love!!thank you Tiff and Micah"
Out-by-God-stounding. Love these earrings. Get the 7 stones. They curve EXACTLY how they're supposed to on my ears. Have no doubt they will be my every day earrings. Will be ordering from this shop again. Stones are super iridescent. Worth the wait.
It took a while for the package to come in but it was fine. Everything was nicely packaged and nothing was damaged. I didn‚Äôt realize I had the wrong pliers but they still worked. I had flat square ones that made it kinda hard. I just used a paint brush to make the loops. There‚Äôs a video that you follow along with on YouTube. It took me about a hour and a half. I don‚Äôt have any experience in this kind of craft. I couldn‚Äôt have done it without the video. It turned out great and I‚Äôm excited to see what other products they offer. My cat loves playing with the wire as I was making it. I also had an extra foot of each wire when I finished.
"Tr√®s jolies BO! Fid√®les aux photos et description de l‚Äôannonce, je suis ravie. Je recommande :)"
"Colis r√©ceptionn√© rapidement et bien emball√©, les boucles correspondent √† la description et aux photos, belle assortiment (j'ai achet√© une paire sans perle et une paire avec perle), la cha√Æne est fine, le tout est √©l√©gant et discret, c'est tout ce que j'aime"

The service was great and fast. The earrings are beautiful. I recommend this shop.
"I purchased the clip on version in silver thinking that if I purchased it in the pierced version, it might be a little heavy - but it's not. Very lightweight, great quality, nice shine to it. The clip is invisible so it looks like it was pierced through like a post. I like it so much I'm getting the pierced version in silver and gold (since I know it won't drag the hole of my ear down) and giving the clip on to a friend because she wants to start wearing earrings. I know she'll love this! Shipping was 5 business days and it was carefully wrapped and pretty."
"These earrings are so beautiful! Pictures don't do it justice! The clip on is truly invisible! I haven't worn them for an extended amount of time, so I can't speak to comfortability, but when I tried them on I was amazed at how I couldn't feel them"
"I loved this necklace , the heart with wings pendant was so cute and dainty, just what i wanted to remember my passed baby but after a day of wearing it , the chain broke and I didn‚Äôt realize it and had to hunt down my necklace this morning."
This necklace is simple but beautiful! I wore it when I got engaged!

Really awesome earrings! My sister loves the orion constellation and she loved these earrings. They look really great on and not to mention they got here super fast and were packaged so cutely with instructions!
So beautiful pieces! Thank you very much Ara ‚ô•
"Super kind and professional! Was able to give me exactly what I wanted, quick communication and quick shipping. The earring came with a verification card. It looks super cute. Both real diamond and spinel for my Tragus"
Such gorgeous earrings - really beautifully made and such pretty designs. Plus they came in pretty packaging with a cute note. Thanks Ohana!
I love this earring. I wear it pretty much constantly and it doesn't irritate my piercing at all. I'm glad it has two holes so you can choose the size based on your earlobe - I use the smaller size.
"Bellissimo, regolabile in altezza! Ottima qualit√†!"
"Dainty and elegant, and I love that you can wear it a few different ways! Seller was so nice to work with."

Magnifique ! Je suis ravie de mon achat et la paire de boucles en cadeau m'a grandement faite plaisir !
"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"
"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ma commande qui est arriv√©e dans un temps record ! De plus, Marjolaine est vraiment tr√®s gentille, elle avait joint un petit cadeau en plus, et l'article command√© √©tait emball√© √† la perfection. Je recommande vivement cette SUPER Boutique de notre si belle √ÆLE DE BEAUTE !!"
en ce moment je n ai pas de chance avec mes commandes ! je n ai pas re√ßu ce que j ai command√© ! pour ce faire pardonner j ai re√ßu un petit cadeau : petit tr√©s petit .... √ßa m a fait sourire ; mais je ne suis pas fach√©e et cela ne m emp√®che pas de faire mes modestes cr√©ations Merci √† tous sinc√®res sympathie .... Anne Marie
Un seul mot : parfait !! Au del√† de mes esp√©rances je devais recevoir ce cadeau entre le 20 et 23 je l‚Äôai re√ßu le 17 et √ßa a beaucoup plu . Bravo et merci üëå
"Unusual and pretty. Very lightweight, too, which is nice."
"J'ai re√ßu mon masque tr√®s rapidement et je suis ravie !!! Il est non seulement magnifique, mais aussi bien enveloppant et confortable. Le travail est soign√© et les finitions sont parfaites. Mille mercis !!"
Jolies boucles ! Tissu de qualit√© Emballage papier cadeau et livraison tr√®s rapide
"The earrings look beautiful. I had assumed they were made with a light cardboard covered in African print. In fact they are quite thick, strong and heavier than most earrings of this design. They are slightly too long for me: the bottom edge touches my shoulders. If you like big, bulk earrings you'll love these because as I say, they are beautiful. They just weren't quite what I was looking for."
Magnifique paire de boucles d'oreilles !
Parfait ! Agr√©able √† porter.
"Th√®se earrings are stunning in person. The 100 year old filigree is in unbelievable condition. Like all my in store and Etsy purchases from here, the quality of the product is very high and despite my sensitive ears, I have never had an adverse reaction from their products. Despite my limited French, the owner always speaks English for my benefit."
Ces boucles sont absolument magnifiques et d'une tr√®s grande originalit√©. Le travail est tr√®s soign√©. Je suis totalement satisfaite de mon achat. L'envoi est toujours aussi rapide et soign√©. Je recommande cette boutique. J'ai pass√© plusieurs commandes et je suis toujours impressionn√©e par la qualit√© et la finition des bijoux. Les prix son plus qu'abordables. Commandez sans aucune h√©sitation. What a sweet and beautiful pair of earrings. It is exquisitely detailed and beautifully made. So classy ! Thanks for making such a lovely affordable piece. Just love it !
Tout simplement magnifique !! Artisane super gentille et sympa !
Tr√®s bon service et rapide en plus elle sont tr√®s jolie les boucle d'oreilles
"Merci pour cette jolie commande, encore une fois. :)"
"Je suis accro aux doigts de f√©e de la femme qu√©b√©coise, le produit est de qualit√©, le service impeccable et la livraison aussi."
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"Just received these jackets. LOVE LOVE them. Beautiful. Feel bad as I kept asking the seller if they were returnable as it said on the site store credit if after 7 days & w shipping these days things take awhile. He assured me they were returnable. I was worried my diamond studs might not fit in opening but they do fit perfectly. They really look more than the $400 price. Thanx, will be wearing them all the time!!!!!!"
"When I ordered the ring, the listing said it would take a few weeks to arrive, but we received it in 8 days! I had to wait almost 2 weeks before Etsy would leave a review, that's how fast it shipped. The ring itself is perfect, it's very light compared to a lot of modern men's rings and the comfort fit edge is very smooth. It's a little small but that's my fault for not accommodating my fiance's knuckles. We're going to take it to a local jeweler to be sized because that issue is not Pompeii's fault. Definitely recommend using these guys if you're looking for a men's ring."
They definitely met my expectations. They perfectly match the bracelet I also purchased.
Absolutely exceeded my expectations! Beautiful craftsmanship.
These earrings are beautiful! They match the bracelet perfectly! I bought them as a Christmas present for my friend who wears flip flops all year until there is too much snow on the ground.
"These are very cute, thank you!"
"tr√®s belles boucles, leur design original fait son petit effet. Envoi tr√®s rapide apr√®s avoir pass√© la commande."
"De tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles, toutes en finesse, j'en suis ravie ! Par ailleurs, elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite. Merci beaucoup et tr√®s bonne continuation !"
Thank you so much Sharon for your kindness. I had asked for a personalised order to fit 4 gemstones in my necklace and without a bother my request was made. The delivery was extremely fast which was also amazing and the necklace itself is much more beautiful than I expected. The quality is outstanding! Will definitely be ordering again from Sharon‚Äôs lovely shop. ‚ô•Ô∏è
"Absolutely beautiful, my new favourite thing, will 100% be ordering from here again. Arrived fast and came with amazing positive vibes <3"
"Such a gorgeous, delicate necklace. It's hard to find turquoise necklaces that aren't too chunky. Good quality hand made jewellery!"
Beautiful handmade necklace and excellent service. Sharon was incredibly fast to respond to my query and I received the package quickly and beautifully wrapped. Would thoroughly recommend The Simple Latte.
"Beautiful earrings, they fit perfect!"
"My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)"
These are absolutely stunning. I feel so elegant! I have tiny ears so the birds cover pretty much the whole bottom half of my ear but I still think it looks great. They are difficult to get in unless you bend the backing to straighten out the angle quite a lot.
"I love these, they look so beautiful and they fit nicely! It took a bit for me to get them on since my piercing is a bit wonky - but that is just a me thing. They did take longer than expected, but that was of no fault of the seller as she got them out by their expected time."
"So dainty but also edgy, exactly what I was looking for! The rose gold is really pretty and pairs perfectly with my diamond hugggies."
Gorgeous. I love them. My new favorites. They stack well with my other earrings. One part dainty. One part punk.
"So very pretty! Took longer than I expected to ship, but worth the wait."
Beautifully made - thank you so much!
"Boucles d'oreilles magnifiques , elles sont vraiment splendides et originales !! J'Adore !! Merci !! Boutique √† recommander +++++"
Love these earrings so much!
Picture doesn't do it justice! So beautiful! It's a little big on my pinky ring but I'm keeping it. Paula was very responsive in my messages to her. Can't wait to buy more!
Absolutely stunning. I bought the snake ear climbers and I‚Äôm in love. Well made and they get tons of compliments.
perfect wedding shower gift for the bride for her honeymoon
"Exceeding my expectation. Perfect size, good quality, with a replaceable filter, a nicely-knitted bag, and a heartwarming note of thanks! I have been looking for facemasks with world map pattern. This is definitely one of the best. Love it."
Wurde als Geschenk bestellt und gleich zum Empf√§nger versendet. Unkompliziert und zuverl√§ssig. Macht weiter so!
very impressed with the quality
Came quickly and was as described.... love how it is adjustable.... not a big fan of the backing because I hate this type of backing but the earring is so pretty I don't mind it in this case ! Totally would order again from seller
Zart und dezent aber eine Ausstrahlung wie reine Brillianten. Ein toller Ohrschmuck. Alles super gelaufen und auf alle F√§lle das Warten und den Preis wert. Ich st√∂bere demn√§chst wieder bei Etsy... Vielen Dank f√ºr diese Bereicherung.
"Beautiful earrings and incredible customer service, thank you! Would highly recommend"
Very cute!
These earrings are awesome. They're really eclectic and funky!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
These are actually too large and I can‚Äôt get them through my ear lobe ha! Not a problem I‚Äôve ever run into before... but they‚Äôre cute!
Great jewellery! I love the simplicity. Super service and communication.
Really nice earrings! Quality is great
"Looks great and simple, fits comfortably!"
Exactly as described and the seller was very thoughtful in including alcohol wipes to disinfect the earrings. Very eye catching item that has attracted many comments.
Great customer service and equally great products! I just love my new earrings. Their quality is top notch and I get compliments when I wear them......which is all the time.
"Not only did this bracelet look just as beautiful when taking it out of its gorgeous packaging, Pnina Shaviv Jewelery's customer service was beyond exceptional. Thank you so much!"
"Gorgeous & lightweight! You can wear these earrings with anything ‚Äî dress them up or down, it‚Äôs up to you! You‚Äôll look great either way!!"
"It met all my expectations. I have other stud earrings that fit, as well!"
"This jewelry is absolutely stunning! I am so happy with this purchase. The pieces are beautifully made, so dainty and elegant. Plus, Beatriz and her team went above and beyond to help me receive my package when Correos struggled to deliver. Five stars and I will be back!"
"These earrings are beautiful, shiny, and seem to be good quality. This is my first pair of earrings with the back attachment. They fit nicely. Shipping to the SE USA took about 1 month (due to customs, etc)."
"Just perfect. Have them in gold and silver now. And seriously considering ordering another silver set in case I lose/break one! Love, love, LOVE them!"
"I love these so much, I have bought them in gold and silver! Really unique looking. Have had so many compliments already wearing them. BUY THEM! You will not be disappointed!"
These are adorable. The gold finish is shiny and they fit my ear great. They aren‚Äôt too big so you can wear them daily. Get lots of compliments!
Love them! Haven't taken them off yet :)
"beautiful! As shown, fits nicely, finely crafted"
"Very pretty earrings, nicely packaged and as pictured :)"
my ears are beautifully decorated now :) My first ear climber and I am in LOVE
"I love love love the cuffs that come in this set! I wear them almost every day! I like the crawler earrings too, but my husband says it looks like I have staples in my ear lobe üòë. My one complaint is that when they arrived (all pieces), they were too tight to put on. I just stretched out the openings a bit though and now they are perfectly comfortable."
"Love this!!! Exactly what I wanted, it looks just like the picture showed. The whole set is very comfortable (and cuffs tend to hurt so I'm especially impressed with that) and I love the look of the set. I think its helpful to shift the cuffs until you find a spot on the ear where they feel that they are perfectly fitted and this way they wont get sore. Very happy with the set :)"
Love them!
Love this item! So cute! Get so many compliments on them.
I have had so many compliments on these earrings! Great product and just what I was looking for!
L'article correspond √† la description mais il n'√©tait pas explicitement dit qu'il ne s'agissait d'un seul jeu de boucle et non d'une paire. Par ailleurs je suis furieuse de l'avoir re√ßu le 5 janvier quand je l'attendais avant No√´l. Je ne suis pas satisfaite de ce service. J'ai eu une autre mauvaise exp√©rience avec Etsy et je ne commanderai plus jamais sur ce site.
"The customer ordered on Dec 14 when I clarify shipping to France 10+ business days. The order could not be delivered before Christmas by definition. The item she ordered has mandatory selection: Left or Right or Pair of earrings. She selected Left earring and this is what she got. The customer never contacted me regarding the issue. I am not only Etsy seller but I buy on Etsy a lot. I think it is best place for shopping and finding unique things. If I ever had problem with the product I ordered, I always got help from Etsy sellers to solve any issue. I am responsive to my customers within 24 hours and always ready to help as well."
Really beautiful set; I got multiple compliment on the ear climber specially.
"Shipped very fast probably because of the N.Y distributor. It's exactly as shown in the picture. Elegant, dainty,like a tiny sculpture on your ear. Love it! Thank you!"
I‚Äôve never had ear climbers before but I love how lightweight and unique these are! Paired them with her other fake piercings pieces. SO CUTE!
"Magnifique bijou, de qualit√© Les d√©tails sont √©l√©gants et minutieux! J‚Äôen suis fan et ne les quitte plus"
Love this golden earclimber - fits perfectly!
"Tr√®s contente de mon achat ! C'est un cadeau pour une fan d'Harry Potter, elle sera ravie! Merci du cadeau elle sera encore plus contente ! Tr√®s bien fait, envoi tr√®s rapide et soign√©, au top ! üòÑ"
"Comme toujours je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ma commande, vendeuse tr√®s tr√®s tr√®s √† l'√©coute ! Je recommande vivement !"
"Ce collier est tout comme sur la photo, il a ?t? livr? rapidement avec une petite surprise en prime. Le petit plus sympa: la facture ferm?e avec le sceau en cire de Hogwarts! Merci beaucoup!"
"Vendeuse adorable , tr√®s r√©active, super communication. C'√©tait pour un anniversaire, mon amie √©tait RA-VIE ! Merci encore :)"
tres joli et tres leger a porter
"Such a beautiful necklace ü§© - I love it. Thank you, Ana, it‚Äô so magically."
Tr√®s jolies teintes de m√©tal mix√©. Boucles d'oreilles d'une grande finesse.

Tr√®s bon service et rapide en plus elle sont tr√®s jolie les boucle d'oreilles
"Merci pour cette jolie commande, encore une fois. :)"
"Je suis accro aux doigts de f√©e de la femme qu√©b√©coise, le produit est de qualit√©, le service impeccable et la livraison aussi."
"Omg I love these earring, sooooo beautiful, clean and elegant. I absolutely love when I find jewelry that matches my style and personality. You have a new fan!!! Thank you so much and stay safe!!!"
Stunning!!
They were very pretty but the second clasp sticks out really far from your ear. I had my hair up and it was very noticeable from a side profile.
"Got my beautiful earrings, love them!"
Vraiment magnifiques boucles d oreilles
Use this for a cartilage piercing and I love it. Have gotten a lot of compliments. Shipped fast! Thank you!
So pretty and look so cute!! Love these so much!
Love this! Really stands out and is comfortable on my ears.
Such pretty earrings. Everything went just fine. Thank you!
J'ai bien re√ßu mon beau bracelet dans la date pr√©vue. Je suis tr√®s contente de cet achat. Merci √† la cr√©atrice pour cette belle cr√©ation. A bient√¥t pour de nouveaux achats.
Tout √©tait tr√®s bien : le paquet et le contenu !! Parfait !!
"Merci beaucoup pour la rapidit√© de l'envoi et l'√©l√©gance et la finesse des boucles, ma fille a eu un vrai coup de c≈ìur en les d√©couvrant dans son calendrier de l'avent fait sur mesure pour elle. Elle ne cesse de les porter depuis <3"
"They are really good quality, look great, and add a real touch of color to summer clothes."

"The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think."
"They‚Äôre beautiful. The posts are much longer than expected, but I love them"
"I‚Äôve made about 4 purchases with this vendor, and I am beyond satisfied every time. The jewelry is beautiful and lasts long, and it always arrives in a timely manner."
"Love these, have ordered them once before and got sooo many compliments. Unfortunately lost the first pair (clumsy) so excited about some new ones !!üòä‚ù§"
They are just as described on website. Nice size too. Like the 14kt gold.
"Great product it‚Äôs 14k marked. Great quality, will definitely purchase again."
"This chain is absolutely stunning! It‚Äôs so dainty and delicate and it‚Äôs so brilliantly shiny. I ended up giving my mom the 18‚Äù chain for her mother‚Äôs day gift and I just ordered another 20‚Äù chain for myself. The quality of the product is absolutely amazing and the pricing is unmatched! The seller, Sara, responds to messages quickly and she is so kind! I am a forever customer of OnTheRocksUSA."
"I purchased the necklace in 16in and wanted it to lay right at my collar bone and I got the length perfect. This necklace is so dainty but sparkles and shines so nice and is a very attractive piece to have. I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt let this item sit in my cart. The price was great and the shipping was very quick. I will be wearing this everyday, it feels strong for me to be able to. The necklace I purchased is the top one (and the bottom one is in 19inches just in case you wanted to see the length difference)"
OMG! I used it for NYE party and I got sooooo many compliments for these statement earrings. They look amazing! Thankfully it arrived earlier than I expected and I'm so glad that I was able to wear it. Looks amazing with my dress. Just wow!
"Beautiful jewelry, I initially ordered the ear climber which was stunning but when I tried it on with my dress it wasn‚Äôt quite what I was looking for. I contacted the shop to exchange it for a different pair of earrings, a few days later I received them and they were absolutely perfect! Affordable, yet expensive looking. Can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day, will post picks later :)"
Absolutely stunning! The cuff fits the entire edge of the ear perfectly. Fastening keeps it nice and tightly secured without making it painful or uncomfortable. I absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it on my wedding day. I also love the beautiful little box and pouch to keep it nice and safe. Thank you so much ‚ù§
These earrings are stunning. I spent hours looking for this type of set for an upcoming wedding that wasn‚Äôt too pricey but still quality. These have gone above my expectations and delivered in such a timely manner. I have another wedding coming up and will be ordering a second pair. I cannot wait to wear these.
"Ravie de ce bijoux, j'ai presque envie de le garder pour moi ! Ma m√®re l'adorera. Super service client, cr√©atrice tr√®s aimable et flexible. Tr√®s bel emballage. Merci et √† bient√¥t !"
"Beautiful necklace!! My daughter love it, if you have a little bit bigger neck order longer size, otherwise is short almost like choker. But it is worth it every pennyüòä"
"Ce n'est pas le premier bijou que j'ach√®te chez Myojewel, je s'en suis toujours autant ravie !! Les boucles d'oreilles sont parfaites. Merci beaucoup üòâ"
"Un grand merci pour cette magnifique bague ! Elle est encore plus belle que ce que je pensais ü§© Tr√®s fine, √©l√©gante, je ne la sens m√™me pas lorsque je la porte. Et surtout elle ne bouge pas, ne change pas de sens. S√ªrement gr√¢ce √† la cha√Æne. La gravure est tr√®s bien r√©alis√©e √©galement. üòÅ Je recommande √† 100% cette cr√©atrice et j'ai d√©j√† h√¢te de prendre un nouveau bijoux dans votre boutique !"
"I really love these, I have 3 lobe piercings on each ear (as well as a few around the helix) and love to leave earrings in, but some metals go funny in my lobes so I then find I spend a while with nothing in them. I didn't want them to close up, but found these. I've left these in with no troubles, they are comfy and quite discreet. Very happy!"
"Bought two of these, one for me and one for my sister. I was looking for something a bit different as I‚Äôve fallen out of love with my belly piercing, but don‚Äôt like the hole left behind. I LOVE this design and it‚Äôs super cute in. It‚Äôs a bit more delicate and modern than a belly bar. Whilst it‚Äôs super comfy on me however, my sister unfortunately finds it uncomfortable and stubby, so I think it really depends on your body type. For the amazing price I think it‚Äôs worth the gamble to find out!"
"I was so excited about this until I saw the actual product in person... it looks and feels EXACTLY like a bent paperclip. If you barely adjust it to put in your bellybutton it looks like its gonna snap. Not only that, but I've had my bellybutton pierced for 7 years (so its obviously healed) and the morning after putting in this gold spray painted paperclip, my bellybutton was completely raw. I'd say you get what you pay for but with this you don't even get that, if it was 50 cents maybe you would."
Hi. I tried to contact with the buyer because I think she is mistaken with the bellybutton...it's made of aluminium so it's no possible it goes raw. I still haven't received any response....‚òπÔ∏è
"The struggle of finding a nose cuff that stays on is so real so finding this one has got ma so excited because it stays on, good quality and looks spicy on. I had to do a little fiddling because the metal part that folds over was abit to long for my nose but it‚Äôs something that could be rectified. Overall I‚Äôm happy and would recommend x"
Merci pour les boucles d'oreilles. Elles sont bien √† mon go√ªt !
"Moi qui aime beaucoup les chats, c'√©tait fait pour moi! Les boucles d'oreilles ne sont pas volumineuses et en plus elles sont tr√®s jolies! je remercie la cr√©atrice! Envoi tr√®s soign√© et rapide! je recommande!"
I love it! Looks unique/vintage ‚ú® arrived pretty quickly! Definitely would buy here again ‚ù§Ô∏è
"J‚Äôadore ! Boucles magnifiques et l√©g√®res , je suis enchant√©e . Pas d√©√ßue de mon choix. Envoi rapide, merci beaucoup."
"I LOVE THIS SHOP! I ordered 3 items from here. For a start, all my questions were answered almost immediately after me contacting the seller - hardly any wait time. I requesting some modifications, all of which were happily accomodated. I paid for my items, and regardless of international shipping, received them shortly thereafter. On receiving them items, I LOVED THEM! They were just as beautiful in person as they were viewed online. I am so happy. I would highly recommend purchasing from this shop. Communication was fast and effective, and the jeweller does beautiful work."
"J?ai achet? des boucles d'oreilles pour mon mariage. Elles sont parfaites. Merci pour vos conseils, vos photos envoy?es en complement et votre envoi rapide."

Tolle Ohrringe. Haben mir sofort gefallen. Sie sind nicht zu gro√ü und filigran vom Design. Super f√ºr den Sommer. Auch die Patina gef√§llt mir gut.
super mooie oorbellen!! blij mee
Tr√®s jolies BO. J'aime leur √©l√©gance et la finesse du travail du fil d'argent. La livraison a √©t√© ultra rapide dans un emballage tr√®s s√©curis√© + un bel √©crin pour les prot√©ger. Merci √† sheilandi pour son professionnalisme.

Bought two pairs of those in size M and XL. Very good quality! Very happy with it and now buying in size L too :) On the photo is XL one.
"the ruby and pink gold ear cuff is really stunning! A little hard getting it in but, once it's in it stays there until you take it off ( which is easy ). Thank you for making such beautiful ear cuff. I have a third one on it's way to me now! Highly recommend!"
Perfect! I love them and the seller was amazing. I will be back! Worth the price and the wait! I will upload pics at a later time but I assure you they are beautiful.
Stunning! Great gift idea
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
"The earrings are exactly as pictured except more sparkle! I initially ordered in gold but needed to exchange for silver to better match my dress and the seller was extremely kind and helpful with the process. For me, these earrings are a little edgy/modern while still classic making them really versatile. I absolutely love my earrings, thank you Dana!!"
"These are the most sparkly and beautiful earrings I have ever owned! I was worried about getting dangle earrings because sometimes they hurt. These ones are perfect! I'm allergic to most types of earrings and these don't hurt, I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! They absolutely perfect!!"
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!
une soudure a l√¢ch√© j'esp√®re avoir un retour et une r√©paration IM
Thanks for your quality item and fast shipping!
Love it! I got the purple jewel and wear it for my septum ring. It's subtle enough and unique enough. A couple friends noticed and said it's super cute and really fits my style.
my ears are beautifully decorated now :) My first ear climber and I am in LOVE
"I love love love the cuffs that come in this set! I wear them almost every day! I like the crawler earrings too, but my husband says it looks like I have staples in my ear lobe üòë. My one complaint is that when they arrived (all pieces), they were too tight to put on. I just stretched out the openings a bit though and now they are perfectly comfortable."
"Love this!!! Exactly what I wanted, it looks just like the picture showed. The whole set is very comfortable (and cuffs tend to hurt so I'm especially impressed with that) and I love the look of the set. I think its helpful to shift the cuffs until you find a spot on the ear where they feel that they are perfectly fitted and this way they wont get sore. Very happy with the set :)"
Love them!
Great communication. Amazing quality items. I order some stars and they are so unique! I‚Äôm obsessed!
Merci Livia pour cette cr√©ation. Il est tr√®s beau et rend tr√®s bien dans ma salle de bain!
Je l'aime beaucoup! Je recommande !
Excellent way to keep organised with all my stud earrings. Arrived on time.
I really like how this looks and feels on my ears. It also shipped in a pretty short time.
"Really pretty, delicate looking ear cuff. This is exactly what I was looking for and it arrived inredibly quickly which is always a plus. Couldn't be happier!"
I also have the triangles and I love them both. I have never seen anything like these before!!!! Right up my ally.
They are beautiful and just what I wanted and the customer service is a 10 out of 10!!!
"Such a modern, eclectic design ! I am getting so many compliments! Excellent quality and highly recommend this shop. Thanks so much"
"As soon as I took it out, I feel like I already jacked up the shape of these earrings and I can't get em cute again."
I am sorry that you are not happy with the earrings. I really wish you had reached out to us before posting a negative review. Usually customers are very happy with them and this is very popular design. As silver is very soft material they can be easily bent back to place.
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!
"These earrings are absolutely STUNNING. I wore them for my wedding day and I received so many compliments. It was the perfect unique and modern touch, with just the right amount of glam and elegance. You can tell they are made with a lot of attention to detail. The customer service was also fantastic and so helpful in finding just want I wanted. I'll wear them over and over!"
"These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! I purchased them for my upcoming wedding, and they are just what I wanted. Dana was super quick with her responses and worked with me to make sure I was getting the perfect earrings for my big day, and they arrived super quickly-especially considering they were coming from overseas! I am super impressed and would recommend this shop to anyone looking for beautiful handmade jewelry!"
"GORGEOUS EARRINGS! They are so unique, I received so many compliments on them! They can be formal or casual! I did not have problems with them staying on as others reviewed but it is hard finding the perfect pressure to keep the top on without being too tight."
"Absolutely stunning! This is definitely a statement piece. Beautifully made, the service was great, seller responded to questions quite quickly and was always very helpful. Shipping takes a little longer if you are in the U.S because it comes from abroad; however, the wait is definitely worth it, just make sure you order in time if you want to wear for a specific event. I will be purchasing other items from this seller without a doubt!"
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are

I bought a pendant with a zebra on it and couldn‚Äôt find earrings I liked until I saw these. These zebra earrings look positively perfect with my zebra. I‚Äôm so happy with these!
"The earrings got my attention because they are unique. And when I found out I could have a necklace made for it, I jumped at the chance. The set is wonderful and goes with a particular blouse that I wanted it for."
"Wow! The colors in these incredible earrings are bold and beautiful. The dichroic glass changes color in the sun, shade, and indoor lights. I absolutely love these earrings; and with all of the different colors, these earrings will go with everything in my closet! This is a fantastic seller! She ships promptly and keeps you informed. Items arrive in the USA from France quite fast (about 7 days). Items are packed very well and have always arrived in great condition. Seller is very helpful. If you have any questions, she responds very quickly."
I bought these amazing earrings to go with a pendant that I purchased here recently. They match beautifully and the bold colors in the earrings look almost iridescent. They are lightweight and easy to wear all day long. No words can describe the awesome colors artfully arranged into such beautiful earrings.
"We bought this to hang on a living room wall. But when it arrived, it was so lovely and peaceful that we hung it over our bed. Since we are decorating a house after our former burned, we have plenty of blank walls. The owner of Kolidam was very helpful in sorting through what she had to offer and showing us what could go where. We have bought 4 pieces over time, and may buy more."
These earrings are really beautiful. They are intricately woven and look like lovely seed pods you might find in nature. They are light and elegant to wear. I love them!
"The ""Indian: is a magnificent sculpture. More impressive in person than in the pictures. A beautiful inspiring piece of art created by the hands of Christine Desvallees. Professionally package and shipped from France all the way to South Carolina in the U.S. A great buying experience with this Etsy seller. Ted Fiore"
"As with other items we purchased from this source, this one was as advertised. Beautiful. Peaceful. We are having fun trying to decide where to hang it. It goes well in so many places in out new home."
"First, Summer is such a great seller. Personable and thoughtful. Second, I've ordered her silver ear climbers twice (because I lost the first pair) and I love them. I think they are a little less heavy then the first set I got, which I really appreciate. I loved the free gift, and I've been eyeing her rings for me. I previously bought my husband's wedding ring from her. I'll definitely buy from her shop again."
"It took more than a month due to the pandemic but finally I received this beautiful pair of ear climbers. The design us very simple but eclectic and solid silver. I love it and very happy with my purchase. The presentation of the item was gorgeous, I'm very happy I have chosen this particular seller. Thank you Summer!"
These earrings are beautiful!!! They are made very well and are comfortable to wear. So happy with my purchaseüíï Thank you!!!
"These are very cute. So far, other than them getting caught on my covid mask, I really like them."
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
These are so pretty on - very delicate and totally unique. Shipping is fast and packaging is beautiful. I lost one down a sink and immediately ordered another pair as these have become my go to earrings for date night. Absolutely beautiful!
"I absolutely love these earrings, I bought them for prom and they look amazing."
Love them. I wanted ear jacket chain earrings for a while. These are perfect. Look trendy and stylish
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"
Just received my earrings and was super impressed with the packaging- very sleek and tastefully designed. The earrings are beautifully made and are the perfect size. Immediately I can see the quality in these and it‚Äôs great. I really appreciate the little care card too.
"Absolutely love! I bought these for work, I work outside and with animals, so I wanted a post style earring that was fun and durable (I know, a real sexy way to select an earring, lol!). These are perfect and just what I was looking for. I get lots of compliments and so far they have stood up to my work environment. I highly recommend to treat-yo-self and get a pair of these or any from this store."
"Absolutely loved my hammered hamsa earrings. I was a little bummed that it took more than 2 weeks to get them, but I understand that it takes time if they are making them, but they are so lovely that it was worth the wait!"
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
I previously ordered the matching earrings and now I have the pendant in the rose gold color. They‚Äôre beautiful and elegant. They are very versatile and can easily be worn with evening attire to casual attire and however you choose to wear them. The earrings are also comfortable and that‚Äôs one of the requirements for me. The chain that comes with the pendant is very small/narrow/thin and the clasp is as well. I have already have a different chain and a choker that I will use the pendant on. I highly recommend the pendant and the earrings.
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
"War meine zweite Bestellung und wieder alles super. Schneller Versand und gute Qualit√§t, dankesehr!"
Beautiful! Love them and would order from kalypsosilver again. They arrived quickly with no problems. :D
Stunning in the ear! I'm a chic chick now!
"Very beautiful Earring, I love it so much! Thank you for fast and careful shipping!!"
These are BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! Great shipping too!
"I absolutely love my my ear cuff. It fits snugly and I don‚Äôt have to worry about it falling off. It‚Äôs so comfortable I actually went to sleep with it on not realizing I had been wearing it until the next morning. The shipping and delivery service was prompt. If you‚Äôre looking for a non-piercing ear cuff, look no further. This is the best quality ear cuff I have purchased."
Exactly as pictured and look great with my stud earrings. Shipped quickly.
Rather large and hurts for long term wear as the hoop part is very tight (even after I stretched it with pliers) and very heavy. Perfect gauge size though so might use it for Halloween/cosplay.
Beautiful item! Quick shipping. Will order again.
"Vendeuse adorable , tr√®s r√©active, super communication. C'√©tait pour un anniversaire, mon amie √©tait RA-VIE ! Merci encore :)"
"Arrived in great condition. Item as pictured. There were some minor flaws , but overall very nice workmanship. The light colored frame is a little odd in contrast, I I feel I can either stain, paint or replace. Thanks for the work and timely delivery."
Re√ßu en temps et en heure. C'est un bel ouvrage ! Merci.
"Tr√®s contente de mon achat ! C'est un cadeau pour une fan d'Harry Potter, elle sera ravie! Merci du cadeau elle sera encore plus contente ! Tr√®s bien fait, envoi tr√®s rapide et soign√©, au top ! üòÑ"
"J'ai re√ßu ma commande rapidement dans un emballage tr√®s soign√©, avec une pochette cadeau : et c'√©tait parfait puisqu'il s'agissait justement d'un cadeau ! La personne a qui je l'ai offert √©tait ravie. Tr√®s belle cr√©ation et r√©alisation. Merci ! Je recommande."
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
"Moi qui aime beaucoup les chats, c'√©tait fait pour moi! Les boucles d'oreilles ne sont pas volumineuses et en plus elles sont tr√®s jolies! je remercie la cr√©atrice! Envoi tr√®s soign√© et rapide! je recommande!"
I love it! Looks unique/vintage ‚ú® arrived pretty quickly! Definitely would buy here again ‚ù§Ô∏è
"J‚Äôadore ! Boucles magnifiques et l√©g√®res , je suis enchant√©e . Pas d√©√ßue de mon choix. Envoi rapide, merci beaucoup."
"Connecteurs Renaissance tr√®s lumineux et raffin√©s, o√π je vais remplacer les pampilles violettes par des perles baroques blanches, pour le resituer dans sa v√©ritable √©poque ... j'aurai un bijou du temps jadis ! Mille mercis !"
"I received the earrings and they are evening more beautiful, in-person, than on the site."
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
"These earrings are so beautiful and delicate and the diamond quality is incredible. I continue to add pieces from this designer to my collection for ALL of my piercings, including my cartilage helix piercing. I love that they also can make them for piercings - that is so rare and hard to find with real diamonds and high quality gold without overpaying for the name brand. These are just as if not more gorgeous as any of the high-end piercing brands out there, at between a quarter or half of the price. You will not be disappointed!!!"
The earrings are beautiful and great communication between seller and myself. A+
Love it. Great quality and fast shipping.
"Item was not as described and sent back immediately. I was told I would be reimbursed for return shipping cost, which did not happen. At first, I was only given a partial refund, then offered a amazon gift card for the rest?! Said no. Something is off here, finally got full refund, but still waiting for my return shipping costs due to item not being as described."
"Omg I love these earring, sooooo beautiful, clean and elegant. I absolutely love when I find jewelry that matches my style and personality. You have a new fan!!! Thank you so much and stay safe!!!"
Stunning!!
They were very pretty but the second clasp sticks out really far from your ear. I had my hair up and it was very noticeable from a side profile.
"Got my beautiful earrings, love them!"
"Passez votre chemin, sauf si vous ne prenez pas consid√©ration des d√©lais de livraison et de la qualit√© d'une communication..! La vendeuse elle n'y accorde aucune esp√®ce d'importance..! j'ai re√ßu un num√©ro de suivi qui apparaissait comme inconnu aupr√®s des services de la poste 5 jours apr√®s l'avoir re√ßu, j'en informe donc la vendeuse qui me demande de faire moi-m√™me la r√©clamation aupr√®s de la poste alors que le num√©ro est comme je l'ai indiqu√© inexistant, c'est logiquement √† l'exp√©diteur de le faire en fournissant les preuves d'envoi vu qu'elle seule pouvait les poss√©d√© , chose qui a enfin √©t√© faite au bout de plusieurs mails, plus d'une semaine, un √©change ex√©crable et un litige ouvert..!! Je d√©conseille vivement."
"La bague me pla√Æt mais un peu grande, j'ai du la mettre sur le pouce."
"Que des merveilles, dans cette boutique ! Je recommande vivement, et merci pour le joli cadeau !"

"As a consumer who is new to Etsy, I am extremely pleased with the customer service of this seller. I had to return the first pair of earrings because of the design of the backing that did not work for my ears. The seller was quick to respond to inquiries and are so easy to work with returns. I also appreciate their super fast shipping unlike the other sellers who will wait for 3 days before processing orders. Lastly, I am amazed on the integrity of the description of their products. I doubted that the lab-created diamonds will look like real diamonds but I was wrong. Their created diamonds have a VVS1 clarity which makes them great in quality and perfect with the naked eye. If you own real diamonds you will know why these clarity ratings are important. I would definitely buy from this seller again!"
"I‚Äôm posting this review so others can see the relative size (3 mm). None of the other reviews (including the one other review w a photo) mentioned what size they bought. The earrings are cute and pretty much as expected. Not as clear as I thought they‚Äôd be, but am happy they‚Äôre not gold-filled/-plated. The backs are very tiny, so even with my small fingers, they were hard to handle. But, for the quality and price, it‚Äôs a minor concession! Also, the seller was quick to answer my question and ship them out. Really happy all-around!"
"My daughter loved these. I bought two pairs, love the quality, and they are beautiful! The pricing was awesome, and I couldn't be happier!!"
These earrings really are beautiful! Very sparkly! ‚ú® Love them! I purchased two pairs of 5mm and one pair of 4mm. They look the same as my real diamond earrings.
Love it for a whisical look but the gold does start to come off pretty quickly
"Superbes, brillantes, jolies couleurs üíì"
"These earrings are so well made and my sisters LOVE them! This seller is helpful, polite, and custom made these for me as he had sold out of this particular design. Once lockdown had eased they were promptly delivered - and they came with a free gift which was completely unexpected! Would order from this shop again!"
üíô Beautiful dragon! I will use it as a necklace!
"These earrings are gorgeous! So much so, that the second I put them on, my partner told me that she was going to steal them."
Love the earring I had to order another pair. Very quick shipping will order again
"I love these earrings! I wore them for prom and get soooo many compliments, they weren‚Äôt too heavy either!"
I am getting into black jewelry. I already have a ton of silver jewelry. Super cute and stays put!!
So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
I absolutely love my earrings! Tina made them exactly how I wanted them. I had wanted to make sure that what I was ordering wasn‚Äôt going to be too heavy & would drag my earlobe down. They are perfect & quite light considering they are crystal. Tina was also very prompt with getting back to me when I enquired about specific details :) They didn‚Äôt take that long to arrive either. Another plus! :)
Very pretty hair comb. I used for my wedding day and was very happy with how it turned out. Beautifully made!
"These are adorable. I do have to squeeze them together once on my ear otherwise they slip and hang awkwardly. The packaging it comes in is adorable, would be perfect for gift giving."
Beautiful piece of jewellery. I really love it
Earring did not look like the photo. I bought a pair of the silver feather climbers and it did not have the hint of colors or the spiral detail as shown in the close up. It looked like a knock-off version. But their customer service is great and they are fast at responding.
"These earrings are pretty perfect. Sort of funky, sort of simple, sort of elegant, sort of bad-ass - and VERY unique! I really like to wear these a LOT! Usually I do so along with some edgier earrings - chains or crystals, etc. But even along with earrings like the ones pictured - where I would have never thought they would ""go"" - they look pretty fab. I liked them so much - I ordered a few more pairs. They fit really well too! Not like the easily found cheap cheesy ones where the hanging jacket piece falls way below your ear and just looks odd. MomoSara's almost look like the hanging jacket ball is levitating - or that you are wearing a barbell type earring! Pretty AWESOME!"
"I love these cute earrings so much! I get a lot of compliments on them and I love having one of a kind jewelry like this. They are the perfect size and just the right amount of edginess to them. The shop owner is awesome, very responsive to messages and shipped the earrings out very quickly. I had such a great experience that I have now requested a pair of special order earrings! Would absolutely recommend this shop to anybody looking for unique quality jewelry."
"Love these earrings, they're all I am going to wear and I've already had people asking about them. I would even pay more to have custom ones with a screw back so I never have to take them off. Arrived quicker than expected too."
I love these earrings so much. Absolutely beautiful!
Very nice I loved them
Love these little satchels they are so cute!
I love the earring! Very unique. I‚Äôve already had people asking about it. üíô
"My favorite part about these earrings is how easy they are to just slide on! And I‚Äôm never worried about losing one because they really stay put, even without a back. Plus they look AWESOME!"
"They are beautiful! Just as expected. Very comfortable, easy to put on, stay in place.... I love them."
"I haven‚Äôt taken them out since I put them in (I even sleep in them). Super comfy and high quality. My ears are really sensitive to most earnings and I‚Äôve had zero issues. Love, love, love them!"

"I bought these to wear on my wedding day, because my partner's favorite flower is magnolia (like the ones that grow on the trees in Mississippi). One of the petals broke during shipping, but seller quickly sent me another pair with reinforced backs so that they were even stronger! They are SO beautiful and realistic! I love them so much. Thank you!!!"
These ear jackets are truly the prettiest and coolest ones I have ever had. The back clasp is very stable and secure and I haven't had any issues with it so far. They go well with everything and change a casual outfit to simple elegance.
"Boucles juste superbes, et tr√®s bonne communication avec la cr√©atrice merci beaucoup!"
Really beautiful ear jackets. I love them.
"I ordered a pair of earrings on sunday, and they arrived thursday! They are quite unique yet simple, edgy yet elegant. Quality and craftmanship is great too!"

"I am very happy with my order, and all the items I have purchased from this vendor, including Anne Klein, Donna Karan, original art deco brooches of the 30s, and a wide assortment of other jewellery. I also wanted to mention that I am an international customer (located in Canada) and never had a problem with a shipment. However I would like to go beyond saying that I love the items I bought. I have been buying vintage jewellery for several months now, and its more than just about buying a nice piece. It's also about the person you are dealing with.

The item itself is beautiful. The shop owner was very nice and quick to respond. I took away one star because I think she should be more upfront about how long shipping will take. I ordered the item which took a month to arrive. It came passsed the date I needed it for. Overall good experience but I believe a better expectation could have been set. Thanks!
Beautiful work! Just as described and arrived quickly.
These are so pretty on - very delicate and totally unique. Shipping is fast and packaging is beautiful. I lost one down a sink and immediately ordered another pair as these have become my go to earrings for date night. Absolutely beautiful!
"I absolutely love these earrings, I bought them for prom and they look amazing."
Love them. I wanted ear jacket chain earrings for a while. These are perfect. Look trendy and stylish
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
I previously ordered the matching earrings and now I have the pendant in the rose gold color. They‚Äôre beautiful and elegant. They are very versatile and can easily be worn with evening attire to casual attire and however you choose to wear them. The earrings are also comfortable and that‚Äôs one of the requirements for me. The chain that comes with the pendant is very small/narrow/thin and the clasp is as well. I have already have a different chain and a choker that I will use the pendant on. I highly recommend the pendant and the earrings.
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
"Omg I love these earring, sooooo beautiful, clean and elegant. I absolutely love when I find jewelry that matches my style and personality. You have a new fan!!! Thank you so much and stay safe!!!"
Stunning!!
They were very pretty but the second clasp sticks out really far from your ear. I had my hair up and it was very noticeable from a side profile.
"Got my beautiful earrings, love them!"
Stunning! Great gift idea
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
Received this as a Christmas giftüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÄüéÄüéÄüéÄ love it very much it match my belt and I really fell in loveüòçüòçüòç ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞with it I ordered it as a set and got a lot of compliments from the earrings and the belt and asking you where did I purchase it and I gave them the website and the seller and the packaging and the way they wrap everything very nice and thoughtful thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è looks exactly the same way in the photos I see something from the seller I will definitely order again üòäüëç have a Happy holiday
"I am very happy with my order, and all the items I have purchased from this vendor, including Anne Klein, Donna Karan, original art deco brooches of the 30s, and a wide assortment of other jewellery.

"I ordered a pair of earrings on sunday, and they arrived thursday! They are quite unique yet simple, edgy yet elegant. Quality and craftmanship is great too!"
I love it and get lots of compliments about it. Very fast delivery.

This product is beautiful in real life and so cute. These were a Christmas gift for my mom and she loves that she can sometimes only wear one backing or she puts the backing with other earrings. It's a winner for sure. Will be buying from them again. Plus shipping was mad fast!
"Full discloser: I haven't worn them yet, so I don't feel that I can give a 5 star rating at this time. It hasn't quite been a month since I got my ears pierced. Just a bit longer and then they can be shown off! I feel fierce, Art Deco-esque vibes just looking at them. I love that these are lightweight earrings. They won't contribute to sagging earlobes later. The design is unique. Nina is very friendly, professional and helpful."

These are super cute and exactly what I was looking for! The packaging was very neat and aesthetically pleasing. Quick delivery and GREAT customer service!

This is awesome! Brown and purple. I have some shorter ones but this very long one is great. It will see the most action on colder days. mine is about 13ft US. Still exploring getting another!

Tout simplement magnifique !! Artisane super gentille et sympa !
Tr√®s bon service et rapide en plus elle sont tr√®s jolie les boucle d'oreilles
"Merci pour cette jolie commande, encore une fois. :)"
"Je suis accro aux doigts de f√©e de la femme qu√©b√©coise, le produit est de qualit√©, le service impeccable et la livraison aussi."
The earrings are exactly like the picture! Super light and good to use! And they‚Äôre very pretty! I‚Äôm super pleased with my purchase. Emmy is such a great seller and I absolutely love ordering from her! Such a delight and quick to respond and super helpful! I even got some complementary freebies ü•∞
"I love my ear cuff and many people have commented on it! In fact I love it so much that after losing it ( my fault totally) I bought another one because I missed it! It's very comfortable to wear, slips on easily and remains firmly in place. I would highly recommend it!"
"Stunning earrings! Absolutely love them. Very thoughtful to include instructions on how to put them in, as that first time is a bit like a puzzle. Fast delivery to. Would definitely recommend."
Love these earrings! This is the second pair I've bought (I stupidly lost one of the first set) and Deborah was very helpful and lovely to talk to. Would 100% recommend the product and seller. x
"The cuff is so nicely made and comfortable to wear - I can't feel it at all. I previously had a double helix piercing that didn't heal well and I ended up taking them out, so I'm really happy to have an alternative. It looks great and the helpful instructions were very useful. Thanks so much!"
Love it for a whisical look but the gold does start to come off pretty quickly
"Superbes, brillantes, jolies couleurs üíì"
"These earrings are so well made and my sisters LOVE them! This seller is helpful, polite, and custom made these for me as he had sold out of this particular design. Once lockdown had eased they were promptly delivered - and they came with a free gift which was completely unexpected! Would order from this shop again!"
üíô Beautiful dragon! I will use it as a necklace!
I absolutely love these earrings! I bought them because I had purchased from this Etsy store before and was pleased with the jewelry. I love that these eat jackets have three different holes to adjust the length. They are beautiful!
"As a consumer who is new to Etsy, I am extremely pleased with the customer service of this seller. I had to return the first pair of earrings because of the design of the backing that did not work for my ears. The seller was quick to respond to inquiries and are so easy to work with returns. I also appreciate their super fast shipping unlike the other sellers who will wait for 3 days before processing orders. Lastly, I am amazed on the integrity of the description of their products. I doubted that the lab-created diamonds will look like real diamonds but I was wrong. Their created diamonds have a VVS1 clarity which makes them great in quality and perfect with the naked eye. If you own real diamonds you will know why these clarity ratings are important. I would definitely buy from this seller again!"
"I‚Äôm posting this review so others can see the relative size (3 mm). None of the other reviews (including the one other review w a photo) mentioned what size they bought. The earrings are cute and pretty much as expected. Not as clear as I thought they‚Äôd be, but am happy they‚Äôre not gold-filled/-plated. The backs are very tiny, so even with my small fingers, they were hard to handle. But, for the quality and price, it‚Äôs a minor concession! Also, the seller was quick to answer my question and ship them out. Really happy all-around!"
"My daughter loved these. I bought two pairs, love the quality, and they are beautiful! The pricing was awesome, and I couldn't be happier!!"
These earrings really are beautiful! Very sparkly! ‚ú® Love them! I purchased two pairs of 5mm and one pair of 4mm. They look the same as my real diamond earrings.
J'ai bien re√ßu mon beau bracelet dans la date pr√©vue. Je suis tr√®s contente de cet achat. Merci √† la cr√©atrice pour cette belle cr√©ation. A bient√¥t pour de nouveaux achats.
"They are really good quality, look great, and add a real touch of color to summer clothes."
"Merci beaucoup pour la rapidit√© de l'envoi et l'√©l√©gance et la finesse des boucles, ma fille a eu un vrai coup de c≈ìur en les d√©couvrant dans son calendrier de l'avent fait sur mesure pour elle. Elle ne cesse de les porter depuis <3"
Tout √©tait tr√®s bien : le paquet et le contenu !! Parfait !!
"Fast delivery , item exactly as described ."
"Beautiful!! The seller was very attentive and fast to respond. They went out of their way to accommodate my custom request. I wanted specific colors, and they created exactly what I wanted. I get so many compliments. I definitely recommend this seller. Customer service is excellent."
"When I received my order it was clear to me that the color of the center stone was not the right match for my wedding dress. I sent Tommy a picture of my dress and he immediately suggested the right color center stone, even sending photos and videos to ensure I could see the color in different lighting. When I told him I planned to wear them for my upcoming wedding, he made sure to rush production so I would receive them in time. I can‚Äôt wait to receive the new pair! Thanks, Tommy."
"Love them and everything else I got from the shop! Arrived very quickly as well, and with a lovely present from the seller. 100% would recommend."
"Love these earrings! They arrived on time, exactly as shown in the photos."
"Lovely jewellery & the service was outstanding. Lost the t-bar of one of the earrings and was sent two new ones after contacting the seller - just like that! Very fast, friendly & helpful. 5*"
Same as picture pareil que la photo
The photos don‚Äôt do any justice to the earrings! The are drop dead gorgeous! Super fast shipping!
"Beautiful earrings! I haven't tried them on (they're a gift), but they are prettier in person - picture doesn't show them off nearly enough!"
"My package got switched up in the mail, Cathy was super friendly and got it straightened out right away. The earrings are beautiful and well made!"
So pretty! Many compliments. Fast communication and shipping by seller üåûüíï
"Literally love my earrings from Arajera! They are the highest quality, most beautiful and well made, and I always receive compliments on any of the ear pins I wear! These pearl ones are classy and fabulous. Thank you!!!"
"It's really pretty, although I was a bit dissapointed at first because of the small size, but that's my own fault, I thought it looked a bit bigger in the picture. It's still very pretty and doesn't hurt my ears at all, just takes a little getting used to. It stays in place very well. Production and shipment took forever to get here (Belgium) but it got here safe eventually, so no problems at all!"
My daughter was very happy to receive the earrings. They actually came a little quicker than I expected.
"Beautiful, elegant, simple and comfortable. Well made, of excellent quality, artistically executed. Arrived earlier than expected and packaged perfectly. Thank you!"
"Beautiful earrings, and so well made for the price. Thank you!"

"I bought these as a gift - and they are just OUTSTANDING. Thank you for custom wrapping it with Purple Paper to match the Purple earrings. Super light, well made, fantastic size and so gorgeous. They were for my mother and she says she's going to swing them around on her ears while dancing!!!"
OBSESSED!!! The most flattering framing of my face!
"These earrings are some of my favourites. I just love the cool shade of blue with the black and gold. The design gives me playful Art Deco vibes, which I‚Äôm a huge fan of as well. These earrings, and really all Scandinazn jewelry, have the ability to transform a minimal outfit into something special - or add life to a going out look. I really admire the artists eye for colour, design, and sustainable practices she uses in crafting her pieces. There‚Äôs nothing like receiving jewelry and a sweet note, handmade with love and all wrapped up in cute packaging. And can I note that the earring hooks have not once bothered my usually hypersensitive skin? Love that for us sensitive types. 10‚Äôs across the board. Just beautiful work by a beautiful person."
"Loved the personalized message and care in the packaging! The earrings are so fun, bright and made with care. Big Love ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you Jamie!"

So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
I absolutely love my earrings! Tina made them exactly how I wanted them. I had wanted to make sure that what I was ordering wasn‚Äôt going to be too heavy & would drag my earlobe down. They are perfect & quite light considering they are crystal. Tina was also very prompt with getting back to me when I enquired about specific details :) They didn‚Äôt take that long to arrive either. Another plus! :)
Very pretty hair comb. I used for my wedding day and was very happy with how it turned out. Beautifully made!
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"When I ordered the ring, the listing said it would take a few weeks to arrive, but we received it in 8 days! I had to wait almost 2 weeks before Etsy would leave a review, that's how fast it shipped. The ring itself is perfect, it's very light compared to a lot of modern men's rings and the comfort fit edge is very smooth. It's a little small but that's my fault for not accommodating my fiance's knuckles. We're going to take it to a local jeweler to be sized because that issue is not Pompeii's fault. Definitely recommend using these guys if you're looking for a men's ring."
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
Just received my earrings and was super impressed with the packaging- very sleek and tastefully designed. The earrings are beautifully made and are the perfect size. Immediately I can see the quality in these and it‚Äôs great. I really appreciate the little care card too.
"Absolutely love! I bought these for work, I work outside and with animals, so I wanted a post style earring that was fun and durable (I know, a real sexy way to select an earring, lol!). These are perfect and just what I was looking for. I get lots of compliments and so far they have stood up to my work environment. I highly recommend to treat-yo-self and get a pair of these or any from this store."
"Absolutely loved my hammered hamsa earrings. I was a little bummed that it took more than 2 weeks to get them, but I understand that it takes time if they are making them, but they are so lovely that it was worth the wait!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
Lovely ear climbers. Look really pretty on and stay in place much better than I thought. Xx
This one is my favorite. :)
"loved them, thank you."
LOVE these... I will be back for more.

"I received a lot of compliments on this pair of earrings. The picture didn't do it justice. It's absolutely more beautiful in person. The crystals and the faceted stones are shiny, in a subtle way, which I like very much. The whole piece is elegant. It quickly became my new favorite."
Love love love!!these earrings are sooo beautiful and sooo well made and un usual.im goin to order another pair.amazing!!thanku soooooo much.
"I‚Äôm absolutely in love with these gorgeous earrings! Due to health reasons I had to let go of my pierced ears and to be honest it wasn‚Äôt until I saw these gorgeous earrings I was ok with it. They look even more gorgeous in real life and feels like a real treasure! ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm hoping for more earrings similar to this in your shop, I‚Äôm obsessed with mine and would love to buy more later. I‚Äôve also had several compliments for them üôèüèª Thank you endlessly for these beauties, I‚Äôll wear them with pride üå∏"
Absolutely stunning. I got the necklace and matching bracelet. Love it!
Gorgeous!
These earrings are super pretty! I had some initial issues with my order and Carolina was awesome about communicating with me and sending me a new package! The second package arrived super fast and with a free gift too!

These were even cuter in person! My go to casual earrings now.
Gorgeous! The pieces came quickly and are beautiful in person. Thank you!
"Hi, I just love my earrings, so comfortable and stylish. Were delivered fast too. Thanks again."
"I love your jewelry and I prefer homemade jewelry over buying at a store. These are my 5th pair from you and I always get compliments on all of my pieces. And since moving out west, it‚Äôs like my earrings are all one of a kind."
"Super cute, great quality and price!"
Beautifuly done. Absolutely love them.
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."
"Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy! I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently."
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
They look so beautiful! I love them. I'm so glad I got them! I'm in love üòç

"El calendario es muy bonito y lleg√≥ antes de lo que esperaba. Quer√≠a algo especial para el 2021. Adem√°s, es perfecto para colgarlo en la nevera. Seguro que repito la compra."
"Love how these look! I‚Äôve always wanted hoops, and these hex ones are just what I was looking for. Lightweight and adorable! FYI - from the pictures they look matte, but they‚Äôre shiny gold."
Quality is great and exactly as described. I had so many compliments the first night I wore it! Highly recommend!
So cute!!! Really makes an outfit and looks great. I get lots of compliments and it‚Äôs a much better value than some of the other gold tone jewelry out there. Liked it so much I have two different sets and a silver tone set!!
"Love, love, love my new earrings. Very stylish and super lightweight!"

"Gorgeous Jewlery! I almost never order from Europe,‚Äôbut I‚Äôm really happy I did- this is really special!"
Love these earrings! They stay in place unlike other ear climbers and the stones are so shiny. I have gotten so many compliments on them. Love that they come in rose gold too!
"Love them! They arrived quickly and packaged well. They look amazing on, they hug tight to my ear so they don't slip like other ear climbers. I bought them to wear for my wedding and I am so excited to wear them."
Love them!!
"I've received so many compliments every time I wear these earrings! I was looking for climbers like these in stores forever, and am so glad to have found the perfect pair on Etsy. They came very quickly and nicely wrapped (in case you're thinking of ordering for gifts). They stay on well, sparkle lots, and catch a lot of attention. I'm referring several friends to this vendor!"
"Meraviglioso . Ancora pi√π bello di come me lo aspettavo. Devo applicarlo sull'orlo di un abito da sera e da concerto (canto in un coro) che ha una manica ricoperta di paillettes identiche a queste, cos√¨ piccole! Ci speravo e sono contenta di averci visto giusto. Comunque questo negozio ha degli articoli molto belli e raffinati."

"The seller experienced some problems on etsys end, which were not her fault, & I got a little worried about my order. However, I messaged her & she was lovely! My purchase arrived fast after the issue had been resolved & did not disappoint. The quality is much higher than I expected considering the price & I‚Äôm thrilled. It fits perfectly & looks amazing on. Thank you!"
Love this ear piece!! It fits perfectly in the middle of my ear to look as though I have a conch piercing. seller left a nice little handwritten note and it came in a lovely pouch bag. definitely recommend this!
This is absolutely gorgeous and so reasonable. It came with a cute handwritten note. I love it!
"Small, delicate climber earrings, which sit perfectly and look great with studs and hoops alongside"
"i LOVE these earrings. Wow, stunning and what a statement. Super comfortable and so many compliments. Thank you."
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."
"Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy! I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently."
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
"Beautiful earrings, and so well made for the price. Thank you!"

"Comes beautifully presented in a little box. Love the colour of my opals within the earrings. Really pleased, fit nicely and stay well in place."
"I requested a custom item, and was met with kindness, quick responses, and it turned out perfect!!"
"The earrings looks even more stunning in person! So beautiful, can‚Äôt wait to where them for my wedding. Earrings were packaged beautifully."
These are too gorgeous and they were well packaged. Definitely recommend anyone on the fence if they are worth it. Can't wait to wear on my wedding day!
They are beautiful and it will help make my daughters wedding so much more
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
"Absolutely stunning!! Ilona worked with me to create custom earrings and matching bracelet for my upcoming wedding, and I could not be happier with the final product! My blurry picture doesn't do it justice, but it's so sparkly and beautiful! Ilona is such a sweetheart and will totally make your day when you receive your jewelry in the mail :)"
Ilona did an AMAZING job! The earrings made my wedding look complete! Thank you SO much!
Love love love these! These are so beautiful and I can‚Äôt wait to wear them on my wedding day. Such a fun unique pair of earrings. The packaging was lovely too!
Amazing! Got for my wedding and everyone gushed over how beautiful they were.
Truly can‚Äôt go wrong with any purchase here... the quality and shipping are always great.
Exactly as pictured. Beautiful
"LOVE the earrings! No reaction at all, i have sensitive ears. I‚Äôve seen some reviews saying the backs of the earrings are longer than expected, but that‚Äôs not my experience at all. Perfect length & don‚Äôt poke me in my sleep. Beautiful, simple set. Very fast shipping too!"
"I got these earrings in gold. These are the cutest, flattering, minimalist, shining earrings I have ever own. I think the way it dangles and shimmers when I move my head is amazing. They are a great length and I have not seen any color changes. I did try fogging up the ""gems"", and they do fog and quickly clear up. I cleaned jewelry before wearing and I was all good."
"Beautiful earrings, and so well made for the price. Thank you!"

So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
I had to switch these out for a different pair only because my ears are a bit smaller than average and it didn't sit right. Ilona to the rescue! She was so accommodating and allowed me to seamlessly exchange for a pair that perfectly compliment my headpiece and dress. Thank you soooo much!
"My bubbly, whimsical new earrings arrived quickly and they're really beautiful and unique."
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them. Shipping was super fast by the way, well impressed! I highly recommend getting something from UrbanRaven, you can tell she makes her jewellery with a lot of love. :)"

"So so cute, love the colours!! Super lightweight and feminine. I've received compliments every time I've worn them! Quick shipping and great customer service"
The pieces are very well made and beautiful. Great communication and fast delivery. Definitely recommended!!
Arrived super quickly even with COVID slowing everything down. Super beautiful and absolutely love them
"Shanie was a delight from start to finish with my dream ring. She was the *only* jeweler that offered this gorgeous high quality Bella inspired ring. I tried my regular vendor here in the US and after showing them pictures from the movie I was simply told it was too complicated to create. Then I stumbled across SillyShiny. I was nervous about making a big purchase on Etsy‚Äîfor nothing. Shanie has the most gorgeous pieces, worked with me every step of the way, and shipping was so much faster than I anticipated. As an extra, my ring came so thoughtfully packaged *including* one of those gorgeous velvet ring boxes. This is a size 10.25 for size perspective. Still looks jaw dropping on my big fingers üíõ"
"So in love with my new rings!! They look my breath away. Besides my dog, they are easily the most beautiful things I own :) Shanie is incredibly talented and so, so patient. I was not an easy customer and asked for various designs and alternatives before deciding on these two nesting rings. Im not exaggerating when I say 100+ etsy messages. I sent Shanie a written report outlining the specs of my ER and some photos and she was able to create this set to match it perfectly. It shines brightly, fits perfectly and is so unique. Cannot wait to wear these in 6 months time, if the wait doesn't kill me... Thank you, Shanie, for creating a true piece of art that I will cherish for a lifetime. I look forward to working with you in future and have recommended you to many friends already ‚ù§"
Shanie worked so patiently with me to create my perfect wedding band to complement her beautiful engagement ring. It took a good 4 or 5 designs and I felt bad asking her to keep going but she cheerfully persevered. I have gotten so many compliments on it and I anticipate many more.
"I am so in love with this ring. My fianc√© got my engagement ring through another company, but finding a wedding band was so difficult!! Until this shop! The owner was so wonderful, helped with every question I had, and even made this ring to the exact specifications of my engagement ring! I‚Äôm not even married yet but I can‚Äôt stop trying it on and staring at my ring!!! Buying through Silly Shiny Diamonds is the best decision I‚Äôve made since saying yes to the man of my dreams! Sorry for the rotten picture, it just does not do it justice!!! Buy from her! You will not regret it!"

"Gorgeous Jewlery! I almost never order from Europe,‚Äôbut I‚Äôm really happy I did- this is really special!"
"Pretty, simple earrings. Took more than a month to receive even though the turn around time says 2-4 days. I may live in Canada but I live in a Major City. I understand they are hand made, and they are pretty. With taxes and shipping they were just shy of $60.00 for a small pair of earrings, I don't believe I will be a repeat customer."
"The item was shipped (regular mail) 4 business days after the order was placed. Turn around time does not include shipping time. Through no fault of my own, the postal service took almost a month to deliver the package to Canada. The total cost paid to me was $42.00 including shipping, and buyer says she did NOT have to pay customs on it. Perhaps the $60.00 buyer refers to is in Canadian dollars or that buyer had to pay other taxes that I am not aware of? Pleased though that the buyer ultimately liked the item."
I've only recently started wearing Ear Crawler earrings and the Beaded Silver pair really caught my eye. They shipped as promised and I love them. I get compliments everytime I wear them.
"Beautiful ear pins, exactly as pictured! Simple yet elegant, perfect for any occasion. Quick shipping and came packaged in a cute gift box. Very happy with my purchase, thank you so much!"
I love these! They are exactly as pictured and shipped promptly. I plan on purchasing more with this shop.
I received this order very fast. I purchased the rose gold moon phases and stars earrings. Both are super cute and I‚Äôm in love! Might even order other colors
Earrings came SUPER FAST & are SUPER CUTE. I get compliments at least once/day. Will definitely be buying more soon!
"First off, the seller shipped these so fast! It was great how quickly I received them. I ordered two pairs, silver for myself and gold for my sister. They are flexible enough to slightly open to get on and close to stay in place. They look great!"
These earrings are so cool. Fit snug on your earlobe. Easy to put on. So cute!! Got lots of compliments. Shipped fast too.
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Absolute perfection. I‚Äôve been searching for a conch ring for almost a year now. It‚Äôs beautiful. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear and is absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely be purchasing another. Thank you so much!
Jewelry is great quality and shipped fast! It was exactly how it looked in the picture. Highly recommend!
Absolutely perfect! I was looking for a pair of small ear climbers for my second lobe piercing and this is exactly what I wanted! I've gotten so many compliments and I look forward to many more purchases from this shop!
"A little hard to clasp but very beautiful earrings and nice quality. I got a single earring for my tragus piercing, it was a little big for that area of my ear but it makes a perfect dainty huggie earring and the gold is beautifully vibrant! I still wear it in my tragus even though it‚Äôs a little big there. :)"
Love my Ear Cuff earring set. It's the perfect addition to my earring collection. Check out my IG page ( @styledtrue ) to see how I ROCKED it.
These earrings are truly breathtaking Ilona was so easy to work with and I received them quickly. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day!
"Beautiful! Just as pictured, wonderful customer service. Delighted to purchase from you! üôÇ"

"Totally love this pair. Was wondering at first if I preferred a slightly longer length...but these are really practical and cool anyway; which I love anyway. Lovely Rose gold tone, hammered affect really good at catching the light and have received a few impressed compliments! Because unusual. Would like a pair in yellow gold...or maybe the longer length...hmm! An enamel finish version would be awesome ;)"
"I've had these strikingly simple and elegant earrings less than a week and they've already drawn several comments (from the guys at my gym, no less - the first time in three years they've noticed me wearing jewellery and I always wear earrings!). I couldn't be more pleased with them. Fabulous!"
"Absolutely fantastic customer service and beautiful quality product! Love, love, love it!!"
Fab earrings love them x
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!
Loved these earrings SO MUCH! I wore them on my wedding day!
"These earrings are absolutely STUNNING. I wore them for my wedding day and I received so many compliments. It was the perfect unique and modern touch, with just the right amount of glam and elegance. You can tell they are made with a lot of attention to detail. The customer service was also fantastic and so helpful in finding just want I wanted. I'll wear them over and over!"

Sch√∂ne Ohrringe. Vielen Dank!
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"The earrings are exactly what I wanted. I needed amethyst ones which the seller was able to accommodate. I would 100% recommend jewelry from this seller. The earrings are beautiful, and I was also able to use the studs for my engagement pictures."
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
Absolutely love these earrings! I love the versatility. You can have a dainty post or add a dramatic flair with the jacket. So cute!
I love these! Looks exactly like the picture!
"These made my ears turn green‚Äînot made of the materials described! Neither rose gold plating or the sterling silver underneath should do that. I have purchased from the seller before and never had a problem. They ultimately refunded me, however, people should know the quality is subpar."
Cute! They‚Äôre just as described & they were shipped in a timely manner.
"They are really good quality, look great, and add a real touch of color to summer clothes."
Tout √©tait tr√®s bien : le paquet et le contenu !! Parfait !!

"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."
I love them - they are smaller then i usually wear but will be able to wear for golf and look great! You should make the same earring only double the size and length.
"Wow! So beautiful. I bought the 18k Yellow gold ones and they are elegant, high quality, and overall, a great purchase. Thank you!!!"
"Exactly what I was looking for.Beautiful earrings, look stunning on. Love them!"

"Such a cute piece of jewelry. The seller is very communicative and is so kind. I would definitely buy from here again, and now I don‚Äôt have to actually get my ear pierced because this looks so real!"
DUDE I LOVE THESE!! They fit so snuggly and don‚Äôt fall off my ears. I would totally recommend!
These are the most beautiful earrings I've ever seen. I love them so much. Customer Service was amazing as well. Would recommend to a friend.
They are super cute!!! Love it overall my expectations

Yes. Shipped quickly. Looks beautiful!
These earrings are beautiful and are exactly as pictured. I love them!
Just love them. Unusual and beautiful. Thank you:)
"So beautiful & unique, really happy and love this item. I like to wear them as a plain matching set in the day then add the jacket for evening :)"
Absolutely beautiful!!! So happy with my purchase. I've gotten many compliments already. Earrings are well constructed with extreme attention to detail. Very talented designer!! Highly recommended seller.
"I have been looking EVERYWHERE for these earrings. Not only did these cost less than my other options but the QUALITY IS BETTER. Better than Nordstrom and kate spade options. Sparkly and stunning. Great for every day with jeans or to wear out to dinner, weddings and prom."
"Shipping was a bit delayed, but seller responded immediately. The earrings are gorgeous and quality is phenomenal. Would buy again."
Love these! Lots of sparkle and seem to be high quality. Wearing for my wedding with an up-do.
I love this set that I put together! The necklace is so gorgeous. I love that I got it in gold. I have gotten into sun and moon jewelry because of the eclipse a few years back. This necklace fits the bill! The earrings are just so cool how they travel up my ear. Great shop; fast shipping. I will be back.
Absolutely STUNNING. I was so excited to show off at work. Everyone commented on how hard it is to find the moon in phases in jewelry. ThNk you for creating such unique piece!
Bought these earrings for a wedding I was in last month. Got lots of compliments on them! Quick turnaround time. Definitely recommend this item if you enjoy celestial jewelry like I do!
"The rose gold contrast with the beads this artist uses is so pretty! I got so many compliments on these earrings until the ""moon"" bead on the right earring popped off and fell into the toilet. It was a short romance that I shall never forget."
They definitely met my expectations. They perfectly match the bracelet I also purchased.
Absolutely exceeded my expectations! Beautiful craftsmanship.
These earrings are beautiful! They match the bracelet perfectly! I bought them as a Christmas present for my friend who wears flip flops all year until there is too much snow on the ground.
"These are very cute, thank you!"
"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control.

"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ma commande qui est arriv√©e dans un temps record ! De plus, Marjolaine est vraiment tr√®s gentille, elle avait joint un petit cadeau en plus, et l'article command√© √©tait emball√© √† la perfection.

"Excellent always happy to buy the most beautiful coral from Corsica,probably the nicest in the world ,owner is fantastic the best by far."
These jackets are perfect for my studs. I had questions and they were answered. Very nice people to work with. Very pleased!
Received my earring jackets yesterday and they are beautiful!!! Really makes my diamond studs POP!!!! Thanks for fast shipping and nice packaging! Will be buying more in the future from you!
Love the jackets. Have them on today. Great quality. timely shipping.
"Great seller, quick delivery, well wrappers. Would buy from again!"
"These are lovely, dainty, and unique earrings. Purchasers, please be aware when putting them on, they are immensely delicate. When I opened the box upon its receipt the wire to one of the larger stars was bent. I believe it happened during the shipping process because only one of the earrings was secure in the box; the one that was not secured was the bent one. My son makes jewelry and fixed it right up, no problem. These really are lovely; I recommend them to everyone. I look forward to shopping here again. Thank you!"
"I got this for my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day and she absolutely loves them! She can‚Äôt stop gushing about them and says they make her look like an elven queen üßùüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëë Shipping took quite awhile, which is understandable for international. The only thing is that with the way the back works it makes it tricky to put in. Otherwise they are lovely!"
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
"The earrings are exactly as pictured except more sparkle! I initially ordered in gold but needed to exchange for silver to better match my dress and the seller was extremely kind and helpful with the process. For me, these earrings are a little edgy/modern while still classic making them really versatile. I absolutely love my earrings, thank you Dana!!"
"These are the most sparkly and beautiful earrings I have ever owned! I was worried about getting dangle earrings because sometimes they hurt. These ones are perfect! I'm allergic to most types of earrings and these don't hurt, I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! They absolutely perfect!!"
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!
Absolutely more stunning than the photo. Super comfortable and makes my ears look like a piece of art. The shipping was super fast. Sorry to hear about Harry Mason's passing. I plan to pass these down to my daughter.
"I fell in love with Harry Mason‚Äôs jewelry several years ago in San Francisco at the shop on the pier. I continued to purchase pieces online after my visit to San Francisco. I was very sad to learn of Harry‚Äôs passing, but was thrilled to find you here on Etsy keeping Harry‚Äôs dream going strong. These earrings are beautiful, and very well-made, as expected. This is fine, unique jewelry that always scores compliments whenever I wear any of his pieces."
This is a beautiful piece of jewelry. I love the length. I received it within 2 days of ordering
"These are my 4th pair of Harry Mason earrings. His earrings are high quality with unique one of a kind designs. Whenever I wear my Harry Mason earrings, I receive a lot of compliments. Thank you Kathryn for continuing your husband‚Äôs legacy!"
"I am INCREDIBLY happy with these earrings and the service I received. I get so many compliments on these climbers, and they were exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for for SO long. Highly recommend!"
Gorgeous! I love them!!! The design is unique and feels special.
"I was hesitant to order these earrings from Greece due to shipping time. However, shipping and customer service was amazing. I received the item quickly. Quality is great. So glad I ordered. Thank you for the beautiful earrings. Can‚Äôt wait to show them off! üòä"
"Love them! A bit tricky to get on in a hurry and don‚Äôt always stay in place, but once they‚Äôre in, they‚Äôre perfect!"
Superbes. Encore plus belles qu'en photo.
"Magnifique, ces boucles correspondent totalement aux photos ! Confiance absolue au vendeur"
"Fast shipping all the way from Belgium! Sweet seller, we are blessed to have such a gifted artist sharing her talent with us. This is my 2nd piece, it's one of a kind, well made & looks great."
"A lovely necklace I was so happy to receive...another beautiful piece from you. Many thanks again, Anne-Marie!"
"I tried to take a picture that shows what the earrings look like in and out. These are awesome! They're super comfy and easy to put in and take off. I even where them to bed and working out. They do take a while from order time to arrival, which is definitely to be expected of such high-quality handmade pieces. Not a criticism! Just something to consider when figuring out when to purchase :)"
I have very sensitive ears and the titanium option does not make my ears itchy! They are very comfortable. Can see myself wearing these to bed. Delivery was a bit on the longer side... BUT I am Canadian. They did have to travel quite a bit üòä. The titanium ones have a bit of a duller finish to them. Would go with another material is you prefer shiny. I might end up having to buy them in white gold too hehehe.
"Like someone else mentioned, I didn't know exactly what I was ordering but I LOVE these earrings. There's no back on them. It just twists through and you can't even feel that you're wearing them. And they look unique and very cute. Nice design! Received 2 weeks from order date."
I am in love with these! So unique and beautiful. I just received silver today and I am ordering gold today as well! LUV them!
"Customer service was great! They took awhile to get here internationally, however, someone was always in contact with me to give updates and answer any questions. I love that there are options to select the color of the finish and stones/crystals. These will compliment my wedding dress wonderfully and I can't wait to wear them."
Outstanding customer service. I placed my order wrong and they shipped me the item I intended to order with no hesitation. Earrings look phenomenal. Cannot wait to wear them on my wedding day!! ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è
"Love it! Great quality, gorgeous design."
"Beautiful, thank you! I think they will be perfect for me wedding."
"I LOVE my new earrings! They're beautiful. I've been getting so many compliments, I haven't taken them off since I got them :)) I received them promptly and am very happy with this purchase... Thank you!"
These shipped and arrived so quickly!! (Received 3 days after ordering)!
"Absolutely beautiful and elegant, just what I was looking for and they don't hurt which I've found is often the case with earrings like these. I will definitely be a repeat customer!! üëçüèªüëçüèª"
Love the earrings! My best friend and I each wear one of the earrings as ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù earrings.
"I‚Äôve picked my fingers for years and they look awful. With my wedding coming up I was worried about how the pictures would look and wanted to do something to stop myself picking. This ring has stopped me picking! And not only that, it looks really lovely too üòç I am really really impressed with it!"
"The shipping was speedy and packaging lovely. I got this ring to wear alongside my silver wedding band when I am working with my hands or do not want to wear my engagement ring that day. (For some reason, my silver band alone seems too thin or that it‚Äôs just missing something-my own opinion) I do love this ring and how the rings look together. It was just what I was looking for. However, the pictures looked as though the ring is a more rounded shape, through the 2mm, where I would consider it more square on the edges, but that‚Äôs not a problem for me. Also, I did think the oxidizing was a bit heavy, but with some silver/gold polish I got it just right for what I wanted. Overall a beautiful ring with lovely details."
"The customer support was so nice, the packaging and ring is made with so much love, im really satisfied with my order and i already ordered a second ring because i like it so much ‚ò∫Ô∏è thank you!"
This was such a beautiful ring! The inspirational message with the purchase made me tear up. My anxiety has cause me to pick at my fingers for years and this ring makes me feel like I can finally break that cycle.
"Livraison rapide et soign√©e A l'int√©rieur : 2 sachets dor√©s et blancs, l'un √† rayures, l'autre √† pois... Ces boucles d'oreilles sont originales, belles Merci Francesca pour tout cela, ainsi que pour le sachet de diff√©rentes jolies pierres Je commanderai √† nouveau"
"Subtiles et raffin√©es , je les adore! Tr√®s gaies, tr√®s printani√®res. Dommage que ce type d'accroches ait tendance √† s'accrocher dans mes foulards."
Tolle Ohrringe. Haben mir sofort gefallen. Sie sind nicht zu gro√ü und filigran vom Design. Super f√ºr den Sommer. Auch die Patina gef√§llt mir gut.
super mooie oorbellen!! blij mee
"They were beautiful, completely handmade and so special for my baby girls nursery. I just wish I ordered more!"
Really nice. Quality folding and paper. Helps keep real birds from flying into my window.
I loved the dresses received - absolutely perfect!
"J'ai re√ßu ma guirlande ce jour et je suis enchant√©e! L'envoi est soign√© et la guirlande est r√©alis√©e avec bcp de soin. De plus, la cr√©atrice est adorable. Je suis tellement contente que je viens d'en commander une seconde. Je ne peux que recommander et mettre 5 √©toiles"
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"I asked for a custom adrenaline molecule ring and could not be happier with the outcome! I was sent pictures of the entire process to make sure I was happy with the final product, which was awesome. This is my 3rd piece of jewelry from this shop and I highly recommend them!"
"Panagiotis is a skilled artisan and a wonderfully responsive seller. I had a question about the silver used in these earrings and he replied within the hour. I love that these are basically a two-in-one sort of deal - they can be worn as a stud for easy daily use, or with the jacket for a more stand-out look. And the titanium is not irritating at all. I couldn't be more pleased! Thank you very much!"
These are actually too large and I can‚Äôt get them through my ear lobe ha! Not a problem I‚Äôve ever run into before... but they‚Äôre cute!
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
Very professional! The seller privately messaged me about my earrings and shipped them very fast. I had text messages too with updates from the postal service. The earrings themselves are beautiful. Excited to wear them...the case they came in was really nice and professional looking. Their jewelry would make great gifts! Thanks and happy holidaze‚úåÔ∏èüòé
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
Very happy with my 2.1 mm 16 in. Paper clip chain. Arrived quickly. Layered here with a 17in necklace.
Its beautiful! With the length and size I ordered its perfect for everyday wear without it being over the top!
"Exactly as promised, this 4.6mm X 24 inch 10K solid gold Figaro chain was delivered in a timely manner by USPS. The purchase amount was lower than I've seen elsewhere, so I consider this durable, easy-to-wear chain a very good value - costing hundreds instead of thousands. Thanks! - Perfect size for pendants."
"Be aware the links are hollow NOT solid gold. I ordered the 18‚Äù chain with 4.2mm links. It is a good looking chain, however, it also feels very light, due to the hollow nature of the links. In fact, there is a small, deep cut/trench along the inside of each link. I had a seamless shopping experience and it shipped quickly."
"Tr√®s jolie bague d'oreille, identique √† la photo du site, l√©g√®re et tient bien, suis tr√®s contente, merci beaucoup :-)"
"Superbe bague d'oreille, tr√®s fin et super √©clat! merci beaucoup :)"
"Tr√®s joli, d√©licat, parfait l'oreille."
Elle est encore mieux que sur la photo .
My friend loved them and is been wearing them all week! Thanks again!
I love the shape and color of these earings and how they are the perfect size. Thank you for beautiful earings and quick shipping!
"Exp√©dition tr√®s rapide, joli emballage, en revanche un peu d√©√ßue pour les finitions (le papier d√©passe et un peu coll√© sur l'autre face de la boucle). Sinon le rendu y est !"
Envoi rapide et boucles magnifiques! Merci bcp!
Beautifully made earrings. Extremely happy with my purchase.
"La commande s‚Äôest tr√®s bien pass√©e, la bague est splendide et c‚Äôest toujours un vrai bonheur de recevoir une de vos cr√©ations !! Merciii :)"
Ravie de mon achat superbe avec un chignon
"Very pretty, looks like real gold. Not too long, but not short. Delivery was sooner than expected. Overall, a very satisfied customer."
LOVE these earring jackets! Quality item. I will most likely be buying more items from this seller soon!
"I bought my first pair as a gift. I liked them so well, I bought this pair for myself. I can't wait to wear them!"
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"These are absolutely gorgeous, and I was surprised and pleased by how light they felt. They came very quickly, considering how far away they came from. Will definitely be buying here again!"
"Tr√®s joli, conforme √† ce que j'esp√©rais. Juste la forme est compliqu√©e √† faire tenir aux oreilles !!! mais √ßa c'est une autre histoire !"
Tr√®s jolies petite boucles d‚Äôoreilles !! Colis vite re√ßu et tr√®s bien emball√© !
A pretty and fun gift for my sister! I love the delicate design and the shine of these earrings!
Second pair. Obsessed
"I am obsessed with these ear climbers! They are even better than I imagined. They have that minimalist look I was hoping for, they look delicate but are very well made and the matte finish is awesome. Love them, would definitely purchase from RenegadeSilver again, thank you!"
"this is the third or fourth time i've order these earrings, i wear them every single day. only have had to reorder because of lost/broken (which are both my bad). the quality is amazing, the curve and length are *perfect* -- thanks renegade silver love you guys!!"
I am in love with the product. Perfect service. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Another fabulous item. Earring so delicate & comfortable. Perfect fit.
Its absolutely gorgeous. I should have ordered a bigger size.
"While I absolutely love my jewelry, I wish it was a little bit bigger to fit my piercing. So unfortunately I can‚Äôt wear it without worrying about losing it. This is through no fault of the seller. That aside it‚Äôs an awesome piece of jewelry"
"Ich habe lange auf meinen Schmuck. Am 10.04. bestellt, angeblich 1-2 Wochen Lieferzeit, am 24.4. angeblich verschickt. Ich schreibe ""angeblich"", weil in Etsy unter Eink√§ufe bis zuletzt ""Vor Versand"" zu lesen war. Am 11.05. ist der Schmuck endlich eingetroffen, ob die Verz√∂gerung wegen der Pandemie eingetreten ist oder nicht kann ich nicht sagen. Eigenartig war es auf jeden Fall! Meine Korrespondenz wurde innerhalb einiger Tage bearbeitet und beantwortet. Diese Ohrringe und das Armband sind sch√∂n anzusehen, aber qualitativ gefallen sie mir nicht. Die Klappcreole schlie√üt nur mit einem ""bitte"" und ich f√ºrchte, sie wird definitiv irgendwann den Ohrring frei geben, ob ich will oder nicht. Beide sind f√ºr meinen Geschmack zu leicht, sie f√ºhlen sich nicht wie vergoldetes Silber an. Der Preis scheint gerecht, mehr Wert ist er nicht."
So chic! I love the look especially if you stage it with other earrings
I ordered it the 2nd time because this piece of jewelry is simply breathtaking. I love it so much. Thank you for your creativity Best regards Pia
They are gorgeous! Same as the originals! Fantastic quality and shiny zirconia! Recommended!
"This ring is delicate and beautiful - I absolutely love it. I bought it to go on the first knuckle of my index finger and being adjustable it's perfect. There was a small issue with a first ring I was sent, but Jo sorted it all out very quickly and was so polite. Can't recommend the shop 'A Little Sparkle By Jo' enough."
Highly recommended seller with good communication and quick dispatch.
Really delicate bracelet but lovely looking very prompt delivery
Vraiment magnifiques boucles d oreilles
So unique and stunning. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it.

I‚Äôm so in love with this earring Its so beautiful and well made. I highly recommend.

"I can only say great things about my earrings and this shop! I received them fairly quickly, all wrapped in a cute package. They are absolutely gorgeous, and they don't bother me at all, even if I leave them on for quite a while (I have sensitive skin, so most of the time I have to be careful with earrings). I just love them. Thank you so much for the great product!!!"
"Stunning earrings, have worn them almost everyday since I got them, I love them. Excellent quality and beautifully made. Arrived quickly with zero issues!"
I absolutely love the earrings they look gorgeous. I have several ear holes with tiny hoops so it's not super easy to have the earrings straight and they are not practical to wear with a mask but they look great and they're totally worth it!
i love it so much it‚Äôs so pretty. It also can really quickly as well x
Got it and love it! Fits my ear perfectly :) Thank you so much!!!!
Love this! So dainty and beautiful!
I loved it so much I bought another one
"Beautiful earrings, faster than expected shipping to US from France. Seller is lovely. Thank you ü§ç"

"Tr√®s belles BO, en parfait √©tat Elles vont beaucoup plaire √† ma fille"
"thanks a lot, super nice earrings!"
So pretty! I love wearing it with a stud in my other ear for an asymmetrical look. The post is heavy duty. If you have small sensitive ear holes it will take some getting used to.
Des couleurs plus tourn√©es vers le brun que le roux. Les reflets bleus sont repris avec une perle bleue. Des boucles d'oreilles d'une tr√®s grande d√©licatesse ! Elles sont superbes!
"envoi rapide, communication au top !

Bijoux tr√®s fin et tr√®s √©l√©gant. Belle pr√©sentation. Envoi rapide! Merci.
Absolutely delightful. They look incredibly stylish and unique.
Love them; lovely. Thank you.
"I bought these as a gift for my sister-in-law. She had pinned them on her, ""I want that"" board. I ordered them November 24, and they were delivered December 12 (from Belgium). They were exactly as pictured and she loved them. I give these 5 stars because of her reaction and the delivery time. Great gift idea. I wouldn't hesitate to order again from this vendor."
"Very pretty and unique. They came a long way from your store to me !!!!! Very nice packaging Thank you Very cute and unique!! They came a long way from your store to me!!! Nice packaging, Thank you"
"Gorgeous, got a lot of compliments and where did you get that!"

"Very, very nice! I am very pleased with these. Thanks so much."
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"They are beautiful...the pictures don‚Äôt do them justice! I purchased 5 different styles and love them all! I did have to wait a bit for them, but that was not the seller‚Äôs issue, but USPO. Interestingly enough, when I sent the USPO feedback about the slow shipment, they managed to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the package and had it to me 2 days later."
"Livraison rapide et soign√©e A l'int√©rieur : 2 sachets dor√©s et blancs, l'un √† rayures, l'autre √† pois... Ces boucles d'oreilles sont originales, belles Merci Francesca pour tout cela, ainsi que pour le sachet de diff√©rentes jolies pierres Je commanderai √† nouveau"
"Subtiles et raffin√©es , je les adore! Tr√®s gaies, tr√®s printani√®res. Dommage que ce type d'accroches ait tendance √† s'accrocher dans mes foulards."
"Bellissimi! Semplici, eleganti e si possono abbinare su tutto. Molto curata la loro lavorazione"
Tolle Ohrringe. Haben mir sofort gefallen. Sie sind nicht zu gro√ü und filigran vom Design. Super f√ºr den Sommer. Auch die Patina gef√§llt mir gut.

"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"

"very subtle, beautiful silver hoops. perfect for an everyday look. would buy again."
Lovely items! I ordered two pairs of earrings and got only one pair. After contacting the seller they sent me the second pair.
"I love this necklace so much! It's dainty but it definitely catches eyes and I get a lot of compliments on it (what everyone loves to get!) I can't explain how lovely the seller is, quick replies, very polite and not only have great conversations before the sale, but she also carries on seeing how you're doing which I think is amazing to find a seller who will still put time and effort in once the sale is completed. I haven't got one bad thing to say about the lady and her jewellery, I'm very very pleased. I highly recommend her for her jewellery!"
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
"I love everything about these earrings! They're comfortable, unique and super pretty :D I've received so many compliments from my friends and colleagues, they all want to know where I got them.

"Les boucles d'oreilles sont magnifiques ! Je les adore, et j'en ai souvent des compliments. Les pierres sont belles et le travail est vraiment soign√©. Merci pour ce beau bijoux."
I really love them! They are more beautiful than that I was waiting for!
"Just like they are pictured, very pretty. Green tint makes them special & unique. Ordering/delivery went very well. Highly recommend this item/shop."
"These are the coolest little earrings! I will be wearing these for my wedding in October and they go so well with my gold sequin dress and they ""tie in"" perfectly with the hand fasting we will be performing in our ceremony. These shipped pretty quickly and arrived well ahead of when I expected them. Thank you so much!"
They are just beautiful I love them
these are perfect love the colors and the style of these earrings thanks so much
"I was so excited to receive my order today! I received the (blue) rain cloud earrings. The earrings are beautiful, they come exactly as listed! They even added an extra pair of backings just in case. This shop had amazing customers service! I needed to do a quick address change and they were able to fix that for me with no problems. I even received a very cute, handwritten thank you card! Put a huge smile on my face. I‚Äôll definitely order from them again."
"The earrings are the cutest thing ever !!! I‚Äôm in love! And the seller was the nicest, they sent me a hand written note too."

"The earrings look beautiful. I had assumed they were made with a light cardboard covered in African print. In fact they are quite thick, strong and heavier than most earrings of this design. They are slightly too long for me: the bottom edge touches my shoulders. If you like big, bulk earrings you'll love these because as I say, they are beautiful. They just weren't quite what I was looking for."
"Vom Material und von den Farben bin ich total begeistert. Allerdings sind sie doch etwas gro√ü. Wer sich die Beschreibung durchliest, ist echt im Vorteil. Im Sommer werde ich sie aber auf jeden Fall tragen. Sie sind wundersch√∂n."
"J'ai re√ßu mon masque tr√®s rapidement et je suis ravie !!! Il est non seulement magnifique, mais aussi bien enveloppant et confortable. Le travail est soign√© et les finitions sont parfaites. Mille mercis !!"

I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!
When I opened the package 4 these unicorn earrings I was blown away! More than I expected w/such detail. The gemstone is bright & beautiful! The pic doesn't do it justice. I'd definitely buy more & recommend my friends & family 2 buy here.
I haven't taken them off since I got them. Birthstone kitties. I think they are simply beautiful.
"I love this ear cuff! It is even better in person. Also, what I didn't realize is that the chained sword can slide along the bottom ring of the cuff which I super appreciate bc then you can place it where you want - I love this feature a lot bc I really prefer things hanging more on the front of my ear than off the side. Seller was so nice to receive and get this order out to me the day before(!) he left on a trip - amazing."
"Ces boucles d'oreille sont tr√®s originales et jolies. Merci beaucoup pour la rapidit√© de l'envoi , pour le colis soigneusement emball√© et pour le cadeau de bienvenue. Cette boutique est tr√®s s√©rieuse et professionnelle, elle est √† recommander."
"I love them so much!! Super fast shipping, great quality! They‚Äôre so cute, everybody comments on them. Will definitely order more!"
My 12 year old Granddaughter absolutely loves the star earrings she received yesterday on her Birthday. They looks so pretty and sparkle when they catch the light. Thank you Penelopetom
Good communication from the seller who let me know about a delay. Having my expectations set was really helpful and now they have arrived I really love them!
Great customer service (friendly and helpful) and prompt dispatch. The earrings are lovely and I‚Äôm delighted with them. Will definitely order again from this shop!
Thank you so much. It was beautiful
"the earrings are absolutely adorable since I got them about 2 months ago I've been wearing them every day..I love how dainty they are and how comfortable they are, I was in the search for dainty hoops to wear specially for bed time and this ones are just on point, plus the tiny pearl just perfect, I'll be buying more from this seller. thank you."
"I love this bracelet! I have an outrageously huge hand span so non adjustable bracelets are impossible for me to wear. The complete adjustability of this makes it the perfect fit every time I put it on. Someone else has to help as the knots are pretty tight, or I just use my teeth to hold while I slide the knot. Perhaps there's another, easier way? Either way, I love it and it is a constant reminder of faith, hope and charity in my daily life."
"Le charm est magnifique ! C‚Äôest la seule boutique que j‚Äôai trouv√© vendant des charms a l‚Äôeffigie de ma Corse. Et en plus fait main ! De plus, l‚Äôenvoi a √©t√© tr√®s rapide. Je recommande !"
"Ciondolo molto bello, arrivato nei tempi previsti. Lo consiglio assolutamente !!!"
"Ces cadeaux √©taient joliment emball√©s et les articles √©taient parfaits. Ouvrir ces cadeaux, c'√©tait comme rentrer en France. Merci pour la belle carte postale et la lavande fran√ßaise aussi. Je vais certainement commander plus de vous, vous √™tes merveilleux! Merci! These gifts came beautifully packaged, and the items were perfect. Opening these gifts was like stepping back into France.

This person is very greedy for money and has a very bad attitude.
Very beautiful! I love it so much! Thank you!
The earring is STUNNING! Bohoreina's jewelry is SO beautiful. It frames your face so nicely and I can't wait to wear it everywhere!
"So beautiful, very well made. Wonderful shop- thank you!"
"very beautiful, very feminine and very good communication with the seller"
"very beautiful, very feminine and very good communication with the seller only minus: for 74 EUR you expect silver push-backs, not the cheapest plastic ones"
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I wore these for my wedding and they were absolutely stunning. Packaging and quality of the earrings was perfect. And they were very comfortable!
I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
"Beautiful earrings! And thank you for expediting shipping, I was able to wear these to my wedding and they were perfect."
"Super. A peine command√©, deja envoy√©. Recu le lendemain. Belle pierre. Bons conseils. Je garde l adresse pour recommander. Suis ravie."

Magnifique ! Conforme √† ce que je voulais ! Tout les achats que j'ai pu faire sont au top !
Obsessed! Exactly as expected.
Absolutely STUNNING small pieces of art! These are beautiful earrings and I bought both the silver and gold! They are simply elegant. I could not fasten them myself so the wonderful seller helped me out with that. I am beyond thrilled with these purchases! Thank you to the fabulous seller.
"Such a stunning little necklace! I‚Äôm so happy with how it looks, it was just what I was looking for as it‚Äôs perfect for layering. Came quickly and wrapped nicely:) am looking to get it in the other stone as wellüëåüèª"
"I bought this necklace impulsively, to compliment the rose ring I purchased, but ended up loving the necklace way more than the ring! Dainty and beautiful. Just as pictured :)"

Love it! It doesn‚Äôt fit my ear we‚Äôre it is worn in the picture though. But I wear it more up like a helix hoop and it looks amazing.
"It's very cute, I love it !"
"Amazing earrings! Are even more beautiful in person and you can notice the detailed work of the artist! Unique design! A really valuable purchase, I loved them!"
"I looked at these earrings for a long time. Each time I decided to purchase, they were sold. Finally, I asked the seller when they would be on the market again. Fortunately, they had just become available. I immediately bought them. I was ecstatic when they arrived. They are absolutely beautiful and have become one of my favorite pair of earrings."
"Natalia was an absolute joy to order from. She was very communicative. I picked the stones I wanted and after she made the ring she sent me three photos to check that I was happy with how it looked before she sent it. The package arrived in a timely manner and the ring was well protected. The box was beautiful, stamped, and an olive leaf tucked under the string. Most importantly the ring!! I love the ring. It is unusual, earthy and modern. It is surprisingly very comfortable to wear. I have been getting so many compliments. People love how unique and beautiful it is. Natalia is an amazing artist. Absolute perfection. Thank you Natalia!!!"

I got my earrings yesterday and wore them today. I absolutely love these climbers! They are so unique and one of a kind. I‚Äôm definitely buying some more jewelry from this store. Thank you Umanative Design!
Love the way they look!!
These are beautiful earrings and very well made. At first when I received them I was not happy with how they looked on my ears but after contacting the company they explained that the earrings are made to be bendable . I tried putting them on and really bending the post and squeezing it on to my ear...it worked well and I love them. BTW the company was very prompt In returning my email and very courteous. They were more than willing to give me a refund. So glad I kept them!
Exactly what I was looking for! Seller was excellent with communicating! Will buy from this shop again
These earrings are so beautiful! I'm a bird and music lover and they are just perfect!

"High quality gold plated acrylic clover shaped connectors - very nicely made, perfect size and very versatile jewelry component. Nice color."
"I have been byuing for this seller for many years. These are very beautiful findings. I wish they will accept credit card payments and not just Pay Pal. Most of ""findings - materials "" buyers are sales tax exempt. But if I pay through PayPal, I am pretty much double taxed. If I pay with a credit card , I will be credited back by Etsy."
LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è

"This shop custom made these for me in record time, I still can't believe how fast they got a custom order out! The jackets are quite simply just stunning! Plus, I can wear my hair down with these and they still catch the light & shimmer. Thank you very much!"
Thanks so much for the quality earrings! They look fantastic!
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."

"I purchased a 16g, 6mm. I love this earring. I have it in my tragus- as pictured. The piercing itself is a little big and a little too long- 18g, 5mm would‚Äôve been a better fit for this particular spot, but I love the vibrant colors and feminine shape so much. Beautiful! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Nelly answered all questions, she is so sweet and shipping was faster then expected, would buy again from this store and refer to others üòä"
"Absolutely in love with this nose ring. It‚Äôs my favorite piece. I was worried about the sizing since everybody‚Äôs nose shape and size is different but it fit mine perfectly. I wore it all the time. Unfortunately, with having to wear face masks, I accidently lost it when I took off my face mask. Eventually planning on getting a new one."
Nelly was so helpful throughout the process. She answered all my questions about materials used and even made me a custom size for my piece! So communicative and the finished jewelry is beautiful!

"Second time I buy from this vendor, as was so happy with my first purchase, I wanted to get matching earrings. The experience was even better if possible. The studs are as advertized, with an amber shine that make them unique. Comfortable to wear and perfect size. Shipping was real fast (within europe) considering the circumstances. Would definitelly recommend. Thanks!"
These earrings and pendant are beautiful. They look exactly as pictured. It did take a while to get them but they were worth the wait! A great buy for the price. The earrings are sold Separately from the pendant or as a set. Would buy again!

Perfect! I love them and the seller was amazing. I will be back! Worth the price and the wait! I will upload pics at a later time but I assure you they are beautiful.

Fantastic minimalist earrings! My new favorite thing for sure. Great seller communication and speedy shipping. I will be back for more ;)
Plus grandes que je pensais mais ces boucles sont tout de m√™me tr√®s jolies ! Envoi rapide. Merci.
"What was sent does NOT match the photos or description at all! Do not be fooled! The wings are NOT purple in any light or angle! They are mostly green and shift to blue with the smallest hint of purple! NOT rare at all, but very common! And available elsewhere for far less money! I was able to buy 100pcs of blue-shift wings for ¬£22.98 elsewhere on Etsy. Instead of just 20pcs for ¬£36.48. The only reason I spent that ridiculous amount of money, is because I was lead to believe I was getting a rare variation of these wings. The first 6 photos (out of 9) show them fully shifting to purple from various angles. The last 3 show them compared to the more common colours of blue/green biased shifts. The entire listing makes it seem like the main colour is purple, yet they are mostly green, if a little blue AT BEST, in natural light."
"Hi, I made this beautiful Necklace and used the Beetle wings and , resin to harden the wings and Czech crystals and flat Swarovski Crystals. Hope that you like them. Hi"
"I am very pleased with my order and the whole experience! It got here in a reasonable time considering it came from France and with the Covid messing up deliveries! The little beetle wings are just gorgeous....an unusual color... love them!! Would definitely order again! Thank you, MarleyAtebas"
"Envoi rapide et soign√©, cr√©atrice adorable, √©maux magnifiques, je suis ravie !!! :) :) :)"

"These earrings are absolutely fabulous. They look so great with my mustards, yellows, and blacks. A jeweler friend today was very impressed with the workmanship! I love this seller's work! Highly recommend! <3"
"I absolutely love these earrings! I‚Äôve worn them many days and they are fabulous! They hang so nice and are a real attention getter. The bead work is perfection! They arrived so quickly, too! I‚Äôve since bought more. This seller is wonderful!"
"fact that they are very contemporary but not heavy looking or feling, and I can easily customize each piece with the colors to match my outfits.

"I just got these in the mail today, and they are gorgeous! I haven't had a chance to wear them yet, but as a fellow jewelry designer I can already tell they're going to look great. The quality is exquisite, as well. Highly recommend this shop! Update: I'm wearing them right now and they're GORGEOUS! I've included a picture so everyone can see how they look. They are extremely comfortable. You can't even feel them, and yet despite bouncing my head around to the tune of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" they haven't moved an inch. I myself make ear climbers and carry them in my store and I dearly hope my ear climbers are as beautiful and secure as these!"
"This seller is amazing! I would buy again for sure! The ear climbers are beautifully made. Thank you, I absolutely love themüòä"
"Super cute, fits great. :D 10/10 would recommend!"
2nd pair! Beautiful

"My dad died one year ago today. I wanted a special gift for our mom, to help her through this anniversary. I liked the multiple-name necklaces sold online, but wasn‚Äôt convinced of their quality. Then I found Rosa‚Äôs work. I was enamored with her brilliant idea to write in cursive with gold wire. After placing the order with Rosa, she learned of my hope to have the necklace delivered to my mom by today, and she outdid herself. Her beautiful artwork was in the mail quicker than I hoped. I was able to watch my mom open the gift with my sis on facetime, and she was blown away. She cried! It was a lovely moment. Thank you Rosa, for your gift to our mother! You went above and beyond to bless her. Mom said she will never take it off! Rosa is a great communicator and artist, I highly recommend her work! We love what she did for us!"
Rosa was great to quickly let me know about my order. I ordered two paid of earrings instead of one. So I asked her to send me two different sets of initials. I love my new earrings. Quality is great. You can tell Rosa took her time in making the letters. They were Packaged well and shipped quick. Thank you! Will keep her in my favorites list!
I purchased the SS Left and heart set and they are beautiful!
These are wonderful. Unique and perfect for the Maui lover. Thank you. They are a treasure.
Such a cute set! Fit my ears perfectly. Loved that it came quick too!
Love! Love! Amazing customer service and did custom work to keep the earring from falling out. Just love it!
"Favoloso. Orecchini stupendi, ben fatti e originali. Amo questo stile e comprerei tutto, davvero soddisfatta! Comprer√≤ sicuramente altre cose, complimenti alla ragazza!"
I love these earrings! I ordered 3 different pairs and love them all. I had a great experience with the shop owner about the shipping delays and was very pleased with all her help with my order. I will order from this shop again.
"Tr√®s belles boucles, conformes en tous points aux photos. envoi rapide et surtout tr√®s soign√© dans une bo√Æte, si c‚Äôest pour un cadeau c‚Äôest parfait."
"Beautiful delicate subtle earrings, thank you"
"Envoi rapide, soign√©... RAS ! Je pensais √† la base que la fleur √©tait dans un ton ros√©, mais en fait elle est dans un ton ton gris (l‚Äô√©clairage sans doute). Elle est d√©licatement paillet√©e... finalement c'est une bonne surprise :-) D'autant plus qu'elle change de ce que j'avais d√©j√† en couleur. Je suis donc contente de mon achat ^^ Merci !"
"J'en poss√©dais d√©j√† une et je savais donc que c'√©tait super joli √† porter. Bon les couleurs ressemblent un peu √† ma premi√®re, je pensais qu'il y aurait eu plus de diff√©rences ! J'attends la cr√©ation du collier et des boucles d'oreilles !!!"
"Merci, je les ai re√ßu assez rapidement. Ils me plaisent beaucoup. Tr√®s sympa sur une veste ou autres v√™tements. Merci √† vous ."
"J'ai achet√© deux broches fleurs (l'avis sera le m√™me pour les deux) afin d'habiller des vestes qui font un peu f√©es... elfes... et qui sont de couleur unique.

I bought this gold 18k bracelet for my Fianc√©s 30th Birthday. Sofiya answered all of my questions with clarity and the shipping was unbelievably fast. My fianc√© absolutely LOVED the bracelet and I couldn't be happier. Thank you!
Stunningly exquisite! The chain is so delicate and sparkly-lovely! High quality. Looked a long time for this a floating pearl necklace in which the chain wasn't cheap-looking...this was It and surpassed my expectations! So grateful and am eager to present to my daughter upon her graduation!
I searched through many pages of beaded moonstone pendant necklaces before I found this necklace. It was just what I was looking for - a feminine statement necklace. The design is lovely and unique and the materials are top notch; all at a reasonable price. It was crafted very well. One of my favorite Etsy purchases. The seller sent me a nice note to let me know when it was on the way and it arrived safely and with two extras that I appreciated - a gift bag and a polishing cloth. Thank you KaratandCarats.
"I love my purchase, Tiffany bead Bracelet, it came wrapped with tissue paper, person al bag, box , jewelry bag an a cleaning cloth, so cute, it does look like the pitcure Thank You"
Parcel arrived today 4 jan.2018 Beautiful !! I adore them !!
Parcel arrived today 4 jan.2018 Beautiful !! I adore them !!
"They are super cute, but they irritated my skin. So beware if you have sensitive skin. I ordered them in black rhodium so it might just be that material I'm sensitive to. I also have the moon phase ear climbers in sterling silver and they don't bother me. I will definitely order more earrings from this shop!"
"Awesome earrings, great quality. Love how you can wear trianular piece separately. Fast shipping. Back metal bracket a little short- the spikes barely hang underneath my ear lobe and you cant see them much."
"Comes beautifully presented in a little box. Love the colour of my opals within the earrings. Really pleased, fit nicely and stay well in place."
"I requested a custom item, and was met with kindness, quick responses, and it turned out perfect!!"
"Tout simplement MAGNIFIQUE !! LE rendu est canon , la qualit√© est vraiment super . Un grand merci . Commande re√ßue rapidement ! Rien a dire sauf PARFAIT !!"
"J‚Äôadore ces boucles d‚Äôoreilles. Elles sont tr√®s jolies, de bonne qualit√© et ont √©t√© envoy√©es rapidement avec un petit mot personnalis√©."
"Tr√®s beaux bijoux, de qualit√© et emballage soigneux. Par contre ce mod√®le-ci demande une certaine patience pour √™tre mis correctement et si vous avez un lobe d'oreille √©pais ou mou, le clou d'attache peut paraitre un peu ""enfonc√©"" dans le lobe."
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles, excellente qualit√©, envoi rapide"
Forme g√©om√©trique moderne. Couleur app√©tissante. Attire tous les regards!.
"Absolutely stunning in person, and sending the gift of matching earrings was such a nice surprise! Thank you! So happy."
"Ces magnifiques boucles d'oreilles et la gentille attention plaisent beaucoup √† ma fille . Merci beaucoup Elizabeth !!! Il y a un grand choix de boucles d'oreilles ""dormeuses "" et √ßa c'est le top !"
"First of all, i can‚Äôt believe it got from France to NY in less than 2 weeks. Second, it‚Äôs SO MUCH PRETTIER IN PERSON. And it fits perfectly. Thank you so much Elizabeth !!!!!!!"
"I love these earrings. Just what I wanted. Dainty, but not too small. The perfect size. I was happy I purchased both left and right. Fast shipping too. I will keep this shop in favorites!"
"Beautiful piece! Diamonds really shine. Not very comfortable to sleep in, but amazing quality!"
"Beautiful!,,"
They don't stay up on the ear. Very disappointing since they were a birthday gift from my husband.
"Arrived earlier than expected. Earring looks just like in the picture. Although it slides off in my ear, I love it, and wear it with ear cuff that holds it in the same position."
"Just as described, beautiful design!"
Sieht toll aus! üòç
"I‚Äôm please to have received my 14kt climbers they are better looking in person, beyond what I expected.... Love themüòç"
I fell in love with these earrings as soon as I put them on!! They‚Äôre absolutely gorgeous!
Really beautiful earrings. They look so pretty on. They were posted and received very promptly too. I'd definitely recommend!
This earing is so beautiful! I am so glad I bought it. It's beautiful and very well made. I love that it's not a stud so it doesn't hurt at all. I love love love this earing!
Received this item in short period of time. Diamond earrings were sparkly. Very nice.
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
Superbes ! Les boucles d'oreilles sont toute en finesse et de belle qualit√©. Cr√©atrice √† l'√©coute qui a adapt√© les boucles exactement comme il fallait. Envoi super rapide. J'ai h√¢te de les offrir. Encore bravo pour votre travail.
"super fast, very nice! Beautiful earings"
Elles sont MA-GNI-FIQUES! Et arriv√©es tr√®s rapidement.
These were a gift. I loved the originality and delicacy! So cute!
"I saw this clicker and fell in love with its lace-like edge, and layered look. I contacted magic hammer for a custom no-stone look and David was prompt and okay with that. It‚Äôs in 18k rose gold~ I thought I needed a 9mm, but then I needed a resize, which was accommodated for a restock fee. I love staring at it in my hand, the workmanship! Tiny, clean detail~ plus! Without the stone in the center, if the clicker moves off-center it‚Äôs not obvious it‚Äôs off-center ;3"
"What can I say? This is my second purchase from David and he does not disappoint! He uses top-quality diamonds and gemstones and the artistry is delicate and beautiful. I was looking for a daith ring that really POPS and I got just that! It shines beautifully. üåü I ordered the 10 mm size so I could have an earful of sparkle. The earring in my (first) lobe in the right photograph is also from David. My APP-member piercer approves of the quality of David‚Äôs work. David has GREAT customer service and is a kind, responsive shop owner. Order with confidence! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I purchased the 10mm in 16g for my conch and I am in love! 2nd purchase from David and now I‚Äôm considering more piercings so I can get more stunning pieces!
"DAVID IS THE BEST!! He custom made a piece I fell in love with but couldn‚Äôt afford because it was from a big brand company.. without sacrificing quality, I got the pieces I wanted while supporting someone who deserves it. I will always go to him if I ever need a custom work done. He is the BEST and I‚Äôm so happy that I found him. He made my dreams come true. Can never thank him enough. I hope that he stays safe and makes it through okay with everything going on in Israel because he is a true gem!"
I realy like this bracelet the shop made .looks so light on my wrist i put my little tiny pendant on it .i going to do the same with the necklace i just ordered .yesterday.. Thanks so much .from the usa...... I love French stuff.
The seller is super sweet. I love the necklace as well. She does custom designs so I am going to come up with something special for my mom!
Necklace is very beautiful!!! Great quality! I got length 38 and it fits perfect! Love it!
"Conforme √† la description, simple, je ne sais pas si dans le temps c'est hyper solide car tr√®s fin, mais l'ai rang√© pr√©cieusement jusqu'au jour J... Livraison 2 jours tr√®s rapide. Merci"
"My new all time favorite earrings!! They are beautiful, lightweight, and I get tons of compliments when I wear them. They are perfect for everyday wear. I only wish they came in other metal options I would buy them all!! The packaging was gorgeous as well!!!"
Iris went above and beyond with my purchase. She always kept me up to date with the shipping information. I know it doesn‚Äôt seem like much but I ordered other earrings from other vendors on Etsy and Iris was the only one to reach out to me. The earrings came beautifully packaged and look amazing. Great quality.
"Achtung - nur f√ºr gr√∂√üere Ohrl√§ppchen geeignet! Sie sind f√ºr meine Ohrl√§ppchen leider viel zu lang. Man kann die Ohrringe zwar verstellen, aber selbst bei der kleinsten Einstellung sind sie noch zu lang und liegen nicht am Ohr an. Ich werde sie wohl weiterverkaufen oder verschenken. Die Qualit√§t ist trotzdem super gut!"
"Fast shipping, great customer service, and the earring are awesome! They are dainty, but because they are ear jackets they still make a statement - perfect for elevating everyday wear, love them!!"

"Another stunning earring from Lycia, always the most beautiful colour. Lots of interesting, original jewellery to be found here."
Bought two pairs of those in size M and XL. Very good quality! Very happy with it and now buying in size L too :) On the photo is XL one.
"the ruby and pink gold ear cuff is really stunning! A little hard getting it in but, once it's in it stays there until you take it off ( which is easy ). Thank you for making such beautiful ear cuff. I have a third one on it's way to me now! Highly recommend!"
Perfect! I love them and the seller was amazing. I will be back! Worth the price and the wait! I will upload pics at a later time but I assure you they are beautiful.
Superbes ! Les boucles d'oreilles sont toute en finesse et de belle qualit√©. Cr√©atrice √† l'√©coute qui a adapt√© les boucles exactement comme il fallait. Envoi super rapide. J'ai h√¢te de les offrir. Encore bravo pour votre travail.
"super fast, very nice! Beautiful earings"
Elles sont MA-GNI-FIQUES! Et arriv√©es tr√®s rapidement.
These were a gift. I loved the originality and delicacy! So cute!
Received this item in short period of time. Diamond earrings were sparkly. Very nice.
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."

"Pretty ring, comfortably light weight, and it's true to size. My thumb ring size is a 7 and I ordered a size 7. Thank you!"
"I waited several weeks for this, but it was worth it. Solid, detailed cuff with comfort in mind."
"Hi! Thank you, this ear cuff is just adorable, and so original! I love it. The shipment took some days more than expected, but it was so worth it! <3"
Finally received my order.. the mail was horribly slow... the ring is solid and beautiful exactly what I wanted... Rin was responsive to my inquiries which I appreciate... slow shipping was not his fault!!!!

Toujours tr√®s heureuse de mes produits.
Purchased recently and have already gotten so many compliments. Absolutely beautiful jewelry and amazing quality. Thank youüíõüíõüíõ
Tout simplement superbe et j'adore que la boucle se ferme pour √©viter de les perdre üñ§ Ce n'√©tait pas la premi√®re fois que je commandais et je vais d√©finitivement avoir d'autres coup de coeur !!!
I love my earrings so much! Beautiful!
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles, je suis ravie ! Elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s rapidement qui plus est. Je recommande cette boutique. Merci aussi pour la petite attention dans le paquet !"
"Absolument magnifique, bijoux somptueux et de grande qualit√©. Je recommande et ce n'est pas la derni√®re commande que je vais faire ! Tr√®s contente, merci beaucoup !"
"Magnifique collier encore plus jolie visuellement parlant ! Emballage tr√®s soign√©, re√ßu rapidement ! La qualit√© de ce bijoux est vraiment top, comptant le garder tr√®s tr√®s longtemps et soigneusement, de part les premi√®res mati√®res celles ci sont un gage de qualit√© ! Je raffole vraiment de ce collier ! Merci √©galement pour la petite attention en plus, vraiment ! Merci beaucoup, je reviendrai dans votre boutique !"
"Je recommande vivement cette cr√©atrice qui soigne superbement ses cr√©ations. J'ai eu droit √† un cadeau merveilleux en plus. √Ä ne pas rater si vous √™tes fans d'Alice, l'imagination est reine! Merci"
"Gorgeous, beautiful earrings!! I am just IN LOVE with these earrings! It‚Äôs everything that I‚Äôve asked for. The seller was very accommodating and very patient with me. This is my second pair of earrings from them and I can‚Äôt recommend them enough! You will not regret purchasing for this shop I promise. I probably will be purchasing more in the future lol ü•∞"
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
I absolutely love these! I wore them for my wedding day and they were absolutely perfect!
Beautiful earrings! I had mine made as studs and with silver and there were no issues. They are gorgeous and comfy to wear. I paid for express shipping and they arrived (in Australia!) very quickly. I look forward to wearing them for my university graduation in May. Would order again!
Orecchini ben fatti e molto simpatici da indossare. Il colore √® brillante e la dimensione giusta per essere indossati tutti i giorni.
"Bellissimi, sono esattamente come la foto e sono arrivati in poco tempo. Il pacchetto √® molto carino e si vede che sono di buona qualit√†"
The earrings shipped on time. I love them. I would recommend them to anyone that could use this color. I love buying from Etsy.
Brava Daniela! questi orecchini mi sa che non li tolgo mai pi√π! <3 simpaticissimo il packaging :-) continua cos√¨!
"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!"
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
"Absolutely love these earrings! I was hesitant to purchase them at first because they‚Äôre a bit pricey, but I looked everywhere and kept coming back to this design. Simple yet unique and elegant with great shine! Not too clunky - exactly what I was looking for! Shipped and delivered super fast!"
"These are the most sparkly and beautiful earrings I have ever owned! I was worried about getting dangle earrings because sometimes they hurt. These ones are perfect! I'm allergic to most types of earrings and these don't hurt, I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! They absolutely perfect!!"
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."
"Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy! I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently."
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
They look so beautiful! I love them. I'm so glad I got them! I'm in love üòç
"These earrings were just as expected and I received another beautiful, simple set of bar studs that I enjoy, as well. The shop owner is kind and responds quickly. The only challenge, which is out of anyone's hands, is knowing the delivery date due to the coronavirus, but these pieces are worth the wait!"
"The picture doesn't do these justice, they sparkle beautifully in person! Very pleased with these earrings. Thank you!"
"i love love LOVE these earrings!! so fun + quirky. Peng is an AWEsome seller as well...he was so communicative and kind throughout the whole process! really would highly recommend buying from this shop, i couldn‚Äôt be more happy with my purchase"
"This is my second time buying from this shop. The earrings are so beautiful, so delicate, made with such thoughtful care and attention to design. They come attached to beautiful handmade cards. And both times I bought from this shop I received a third pair of beautiful earrings as a gift. There's obviously so much love of craft involved here and friendliness toward the customer. I love this shop so much."
Tr√®s jolies boucles. Bonne qualit√©. Bon rapport qualit√© prix Je suis ravie. Merci üôÇ
"These pink jade pierced earrings are pretty, but a lighter pink color than shown on my computer. They are a soft pink, not a bright pink. The earrings are well-made, safely packaged, and timely shipped. Thank you."
Exactly what i was looking for! Has a nice wheight and the perfect size! Thank you!
Satisfaite de l'achat de mes boucles d'oreilles en Sugilite.
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©"
"I ADORE the white topaz ear pins! I bought a pair instead of just the one. I wore them out to dinner last night and I was stopped by several people and asked about them. I have my ears pierced 15 times, so ear cuffs and crawlers dont really work for me. I will definitely be ordering some more similar items from this shop. Beautiful!"
Beautiful ear cuff looks amazing in the ear and very fast delivery too. I think I may have to order another one very soon :) A+++++++ for quality and service.
Beautifully constructed - can't wait to wear!
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
These were PERFECT for my wedding day! Love love love!!!
"These earrings are absolutely STUNNING. I wore them for my wedding day and I received so many compliments. It was the perfect unique and modern touch, with just the right amount of glam and elegance. You can tell they are made with a lot of attention to detail. The customer service was also fantastic and so helpful in finding just want I wanted. I'll wear them over and over!"
"Exactement ce que je voulais. Colis arriv√© tr√®s rapidement et tr√®s bien prot√©g√©. Au top, merci beaucoup !!!"
Looks exactly like the picture and provides a unique spin on an everyday piece.
Absolutely stunning. I bought the snake ear climbers and I‚Äôm in love. Well made and they get tons of compliments.
Picture doesn't do it justice! So beautiful! It's a little big on my pinky ring but I'm keeping it. Paula was very responsive in my messages to her. Can't wait to buy more!
It arrived quicker than expected and it‚Äôs so lovely!!! It‚Äôs delicate but not so much so it causes worry it‚Äôll break. Sizing is accurate and I love the fact there are quarter sizes. I absolutely ADORE it and would definitely purchase rings from this shop again!
Simply stunning design!
"Strakke, fijne oorbellen. Heel blij mee."
"Love these earrings, so unique and simple! Packaged neatly and arrived on time. Definitely will be buying again from AgJc."
"Elegantes y sofisticados, me encantaron."
"These came quickly and are really nice quality. I've always had silver so the titanium is a little different -- it's not as shiny or silver but also great for sensitivity. In this picture, you can see that the small hoops are less shiny than the big hoops, which are silver. All the years that I've had my piercings, I've never had a matching set so I really like these. For reference, the top earrings are 8mm, the next is 6mm, middle is 8 mm again, and the second hole is 10 mm. They are easy to get on and off and didn't create an sensitivity issues, particularly with my newest piercing, which I was able to change out easily."
"These are great! I haven't worn earrings in a long time bc all my earrings feel itchy or poke me in the head. These are so comfy to sleep in! I've worn them overnight now and my holes are not itchy or irritated at all. I like the simple look, it goes with anything."
The 11mm size is perfect for a looser fit on my lobe piercing!
I purchased one of these last year and decided I wanted another one for my left ear - they are super cute! Customer service is exceptional and Vera is a pleasure to deal with - fast and friendly replies to my questions.
Love this ring! I think the sizing is maybe a bit off. I am usually an 8 US for my index but I needed to order a 9 in this ring. We got one for all the ladies in my immediate family and it's a big hit.
"These earrings are just so cute!! Such a simple design, but adds a really great quirky vibe to everyday jewelry :)"
"Absolutely love this necklace! The clasp is a little hard to work with but such great quality for the price! It took quite a while to get here but the seller was very responsive and professional, and I wasn‚Äôt in a hurry to receive it just wanted to make sure I would receive it - Etsy gives an estimated date that‚Äôs about 3 weeks off, but I also live in the US and it ships from Canada so there‚Äôs a delay!"
Delicate. Minimalist. Perfect for my girlfriend who wants something beautiful without being too flashy
"If you think this earring piece looks cute in the photos, just wait until you see it in person!!! The quality is amazing and the earring is sooooo pretty! I was worried about the cuff being a little tight but that fits perfect as well. The item was delivered fast and came in a cute little box - earring had no damages ^^. I fully recommend buying this!!"
Super cute ! The packaging is so nice and it got here very quick! You gotta get the hang of putting in on your ear comfortably but once you find your way you‚Äôll love it! I have gotten so many compliments!
"Just got delivered today and I can‚Äôt get over how cute it is! Looks even better when on, can‚Äôt wait to wear it with a cute pair of earrings. Wish it came as a pair instead for just one ear, but I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. It also came with a discount code for my next buy! ÔºàÔºæœâÔºæÔºâ"
My earring arrived in a VERY timely manner and looks so cute!! The packaging went very well with the product and the product itself is an absolute work of art! I‚Äôm so happy with it and hope to buy more from this shop when I can!
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."

They look so beautiful! I love them. I'm so glad I got them! I'm in love üòç
I absolutely LOVE these earrings! Sparkle with a little spunk!
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I wore these for my wedding and they were absolutely stunning. Packaging and quality of the earrings was perfect. And they were very comfortable!
I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
They look so beautiful! I love them. I'm so glad I got them! I'm in love üòç
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
These earrings are absolutely adorable!!! I loved them and instantly put them in. I have not bought any earrings that climb your ear so I was nervous but they look great!!!
The first pair arrived broken. Seller was easy to contact and sent a replacement fast. The replacements are beautiful!! I would recommend
"Simply elegant- Beautiful, quality, comfortable earrings that are even nicer than I had hoped. The customer service and communications were exceptional (for even this small order). A truly wonderful experience and deserves more than 5 stars."
"Isabella is the reason Etsy is so special. She epitomizes the boutique essence via a virtual platform. My grandma is turning 104. Isabella took such interest and went above and beyond to send my item quickly, beautifully packaged and with a lovely extra treat for my Grandma! She also writes lovely quotes and sentiments on the cards her items are on. I will continue to shop her treasures and cannot recommend her enough. Quality is gorgeous. Communication is perfection. What more could you want! This was such a positive happy purchase. Thank you xxxx"
Necklaces I bought from Carazo Village even more beautiful in person! Glad I was able to find them! They were shipped so nicely and quickly. Thank you!!!
This shell necklace screams Summer! I love it and am so glad I can take it off the cord and put on some of my other gold chains. Fast delivery too!!
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"I bought my daughter real diamond studs for her 21st birthday. She refuses to take them off for anything other than cleaning them. I bought her 2 different jackets (hoop style) so she could mix it up without having to remove them. A gold tone pair and a silver. They‚Äôre perfect and she adores them!! Goes from a work to party look, best of both worlds :) Here‚Äôs the combo she wore for Thanksgiving:) She received many compliments!"
These earring jackets are just beautiful and so sturdy. I would definitely recommend them . They look great with my diamond studs.
j'adore tout simplement ! original
"This piece is my new favorite! Simple and elegant, it has subtle power to tie the outfit together. It dresses up my casual style and garners compliments nearly every time I wear it. Can't wait to get my hands on a classic mala!"
"My La Plaza Quartz necklace is the perfect accessory! I wear it with a white t and jeans or layer it with a few more chains with a black outfit when I'm dressing up. I also love that I think about the Quartz origin in Santa Fe, one of my favorite places on earth. üíô"
This is SPECTACULAR! So unique. I get stopped all the time by people asking about it. The construction is impeccable; I was nervous if the feathers were going to fall off...but it is totally sound.
Bought as Stocking stuffers for my girls. Beautiful!!! Wanted to keep for myself but sadly I was a good Mommy and gave them to the girls.
"super cute, a few more words"
Looks great and is well constructed.
"These earrings a super unique and so cute! From the images online I thought the end of the square connected to the back of the earring to go around your ear lobe, but its actually flat which is nice because you can see the shape clearly. The gold is great and doesn't look cheap or fake! Will definitely purchase earrings from here again."
"This ring is so beautiful! The quality is great. I readjust it a lot, and the material has yet to show any signs of wearing out. I've always been picky with my jewelry, but after getting this ring I for sure trust this seller!"
"Tr√®s bonne r√©ception, colis r√©alis√© avec soin, et tr√®s bonne communication avec le vendeur fort professionnel. Le porte clefs en lui-m√™me m√™me est superbe, color√© et moderne. L'esprit r√©cup est tout √† fait l√†! L'objet correspond parfaitement au descriptif. Bonne continuation, et bravo pour votre travail! Dolores"
I love them and they are really lightweight.
"ne correspond pas du tout √† la photo ni aux descriptifs, finitions tr√®s mal faites, et se permet de faire des r√©flexions je d√©conseille fortement ce vendeur"
"Patricia a √©t√© rembours√©e de la totalit√© de son achat imm√©diatement apr√®s sa r√©clamation. Pour le reste, chacun est libre de penser ce qu'il veut."
Arrived safely very nicely wrapped good service Thank you . Something a little different to recyle an unusual item.
These earrings were just gorgeous and I am wanting them in more colors!! I have already received many compliments on them because they are so unique! I will definitely buy more!
"Panagiotis is a skilled artisan and a wonderfully responsive seller. I had a question about the silver used in these earrings and he replied within the hour. I love that these are basically a two-in-one sort of deal - they can be worn as a stud for easy daily use, or with the jacket for a more stand-out look. And the titanium is not irritating at all. I couldn't be more pleased! Thank you very much!"
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
"Wow these are beautiful! They seem to be high quality. The pinwheels actually spin. They sit perfectly in my ears. I have a strange address, but the shop owner was more than helpful with working out how to get these earrings to me. They were very sweet and replies were prompt."
"Superbe! Arriv√© rapidement et bien emball√©. Personnalis√© pour moi avec un tour de cou en m√©tal au lieu d'un ruban. Je suis ravie! üíñ Ang√©lique est tr√®s dou√©e et g√©n√©reuse, elle a rajout√© de jolis petits cadeaux √† chacun de mes colis."
"Oggetto stupendo, come da descrizione. Artista bravissima e molto disponibile, ho anche ricevuto un paio di orecchini molto carini in regalo. Superconsigliata!"
Bijoux parfait j adore. livr√© tr√®s rapidement. Un grand merci pour le petit cadeau en plus.
"Beautiful, very light and original. It arrived promptly and was packaged with care. I love it! üíñ Ang√©lique was very nice and is open to customizations. Hope she gets a lot of sales! üòä"
"I have been looking EVERYWHERE for these earrings. Not only did these cost less than my other options but the QUALITY IS BETTER. Better than Nordstrom and kate spade options. Sparkly and stunning. Great for every day with jeans or to wear out to dinner, weddings and prom."
"Shipping was a bit delayed, but seller responded immediately. The earrings are gorgeous and quality is phenomenal. Would buy again."
Most amazing ring I have ever laid my eyes on. I wear it all the time and never take it off other than to do dishes or shower and sometimes when I sleep. The energy is intense and it is very much loved. Thank you!!! I am so happy that it is mine. <3 Thank you for your amazing talents.
Very classy and beautiful pair of earrings! Fast delivery and they complemented my outfit very well. Thank you!
Beautiful and elegant. Customer service is lovely and helpful!
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
I highly recommend this earring! the shipment was very fast and maytal is super nice and very responsive. looks just like the photo :)
I love the combination of shapes and textures in these earings! They are unique and beautiful!
I love the shape and color of these earings and how they are the perfect size. Thank you for beautiful earings and quick shipping!
"Beautiful earings! I love the shapes, colors, and the size is perfect! Thank you!"
"Superbe, envoie un peu long justifi√© par la rentr√©e, qu'√† r√©ception de la commande, j'aurai aim√© avoir r√©ponse au message... Mais toujours ravie des boucles d'oreilles !"
I realy like this bracelet the shop made .looks so light on my wrist i put my little tiny pendant on it .i going to do the same with the necklace i just ordered .yesterday.. Thanks so much .from the usa...... I love French stuff.
"Je suis ravie, comme toujours. Les boucles sont superbes et arriv√©es en un temps record. Le collier r√©ponds parfaitement √† mes attentes et la personnalisation demand√©es √† √©t√© respect√©e, je suis aux anges! Merci encore de votre efficacit√©!"
The seller is super sweet. I love the necklace as well. She does custom designs so I am going to come up with something special for my mom!
Necklace is very beautiful!!! Great quality! I got length 38 and it fits perfect! Love it!
I wore these for my wedding and they were absolutely stunning. Packaging and quality of the earrings was perfect. And they were very comfortable!
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
"Beautiful earrings! And thank you for expediting shipping, I was able to wear these to my wedding and they were perfect."
"Very happy! I have been looking for almost a year for a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù that would allow me to wear pearls I inherited from my Grandmother. I have stretched lobes and wouldn‚Äôt change that, but do want to wear this pair of earrings on occasion. These jackets allow me get a good fit that won‚Äôt slip through. I bought a couple sizes and colors to mix up and pair on the front and back of my lobe to secure the pearl. So excited it works and will probably order more. Beautiful and functional!"
Beautiful! Go by the seller‚Äôs recommendation regarding sizing. The smallest size is REALLY small. I wanted a bezel look for my 0.6 ctw diamond studs. I would get the x-small instead of the xx-small next time. Overall very happy! Quick delivery.
I needed to add a birthstone ring to my collection - we had another baby! The seller of the original set I have is no longer live on Etsy so I searched for a similar ring and this was the closest I could find. It‚Äôs the closest I could possibly ask for considering I was looking to match a 6 year old set. It blends right in with the other three I already had and makes a complete set. Shipping was super fast and tracking was updated which is always nice. Overall I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase.
"I like these...it's such a good idea:) I think the tiny studs work best... I tried some of my larger studs in them and they made the charming, layered aspect seem heavy to me, and there doesn't feel like enough length of stud in the back to make them feel secure. Still, they are fun and provide a creative way to wear stud earrings:) Excellent seller and fast shipping!"
"Tres beaux et tres bien confectionnes! En plus, son arrives super vite! Tres bon achat."

La pochette est superbe et correspond exactement √† la photo. L'envoi a √©t√© tr√®s rapide et la vendeuse tr√®s disponible. Je suis ravie
Cest magnifique je le recommande c 'est l√©ger mais tr√®s confortable √† porter au niveau des oreilles nickel prot√®ge bien contrairement √† d'autres masques que jai pris ou c'est tr√®s inconfortable a porter. Merci
"Mille merci pour l‚Äôenvoi rapide, la qualit√© des bijoux et votre gentillesse !!! Je vous recommanderai avec grand plaisir ! Merci !"
Je les porte tout le temps merci !
"Tr√®s satisfaite de mon achat ! Tr√®s bonne qualit√©, envoie plus que rapide et le petit cadeau en plus, l'emballage, Jo√´lle est parfaite, on a juste envie de commander √† nouveau ! Merci ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Je les adore - le petit colibri est ravissant et les boucles se mettent tr√®s facilement - je reviens r√©guli√®rement dans la boutique de Jo√´lle, et c'est toujours un vrai plaisir - Jo√´lle est extr√™mement attentive et bienveillante, et ses bijoux sont d'excellente qualit√©, tr√®s jolis et d√©licats !"
magnifique. ma photo ne lui rend pas justice. quand j'ai eu fini de renfiler les 250 chips (!) j'ai eu l'impression d'avoir un sautoir pr√©cieux :-) arriv√© vite et bien emball√© accompagn√© d'une petite grenouille origami toute mimi !
"B.O. plus petites que pr√©vu mais en revanche, Cristelle est tr√®s √† l'√©coute : elle m'a mont√© les B.O. sur les crochets en argent que j'avais inclus √† ma commande. Merci !"
I am very pleased with my purchase. The items are of great quality and so creative. The cristals are beautiful. I love the bracelets and the earrings. I really recommend !
"Tr√®s jolie citrine. Envoi soign√© avec petite grenouille en origami en cadeau, carte fleur de vie pour recharger les cristaux et bon de retour en cas de probl√®me. Cristelle pense √† tout. Les pierres sont plus grosses que ce que je croyais et pas trop irr√©guli√®res pour des chips. Rapport qualit√©-prix excellent, je recommande. Juste une petite suggestion : faire les colliers un peu plus courts et les bracelets un peu moins justes ! Je rach√®terai des bijoux dans cette boutique (merci Cristelle de m'avertir quand vous aurez de l'oeil de tigre et de la cornaline !)"
I received these ear bars very quickly. They are very well crafted. This is going to be my go to earrings!
"They arrived just as described. It's difficult to find simple, copper jewelry. So I'm completely happy with them."
"These were so cute, loved them and they are at a great price. My 13 yer old is attempting to take them away =)"
Beautiful! Excellent communication too! !
"Literally have gotten five climber earrings from this shop in the past few weeks. I‚Äôm in complete love. Amazing quality and work, fast shipping too. Thank you so much!!!"
Received these and I'm so happy! They are just as beautiful as the pictures made them seem! So we'll made and I am so excited to wear them! Love them!
"These earrings are exactly what I was looking for! So dainty, but something a bit different. I can't wait to wear them on my wedding day! I would definitely recommend these. Really well made and fabulous customer service."
"These ear crawlers are even more gorgeous in person, they're really well made, and they're comfortable. These will be the perfect addition to my wedding ensemble"
"Super quick to respond and ship these beauties out! Just as detailed as in the photo, love 'em!"
I totally love it :) The quality is very good and it fits perfect
Beautiful.
"Sehr gute Qualit√§t, guter Preis, kann ich nur weiterempfehlen."
The earrings are beautiful! I wear them every day. I‚Äôm so happy with this purchase!
Love these earrings! Worn them every day since receipt.
"These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! I was nervous ordering something from so far away as Russia and I will never feel that way again. It does take a little longer naturally, because of the distance, but they came in a very reasonable time and these earrings are worth the wait. I will definitely buy again. The earrings are just perfect! The size, the price, the quality...stunning. Thank you so much! Estella"
Luv them!!!
"Even more beautiful in person. They've got a good amount of weight to them. They're not uncomfortably heavy, but heavy enough to feel them."
"The brooch just arrived and it is stunningly beautiful! I will definitely buy more from your company in the future. I live in the United States and it took a few months to arrive because of the obvious distance/international pandemic, but it was well worth the wait! The piece is truly one of a kind."
"These are the second pair of ear crawlers I have purchased. After the quality and comfort of the first I knew I wanted another pair. They are as beautiful in person. This seller has amazing things. If you‚Äôre considering buying, you should, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"Got these for me and my girls for the wedding, they are perfect! Got them in rose gold and silver and they are so pretty and light."
These are so cute! Such a statement piece. I am not big on giant hoops or gaudy jewelry. These are so nice and elegant they go with everything!
"Love these!! Shipped super fast and arrived safe & sound in a cute little bag. I got the rose gold ones colored ones, and they go great with the rest of my rose gold jewelry collection. Thank you!!"
"Ich liebe diese Ohrringe, sie sind wirklich einzigartig und ein Hingucker. Alles perfekt abgelaufen. Vielen lieben Dank Herzliche Gr√º√üe Pia"
I ordered it the 2nd time because this piece of jewelry is simply breathtaking. I love it so much. Thank you for your creativity Best regards Pia
"D√©√ßue. La photo port√©e ne repr√©sente pas la couleur r√©elle de la boucle d'oreille.La couleur est jaune, un jaune qui fait tr√®s toc. C'est donc cher pour ce que c'est. De plus vendeur sans aucune communication."
Espectaculares. Son preciosos y est√°n muy bien hechos.
Absolutely perfect‚ù§Ô∏è
the earings are beautiful. this is the 3rd or 4th pair of earrings ive ordered. the craftsmanship and attention to detail is amazing. theyre not heavy at all and my fiance loves them. I highly reccomend anything that argaman osnatt makes.
"Pure talent! Intricate and class! I bought this for my love,she smiled!"
I love these earrings very delicate and are so light to wear but look expensive :) I could not wear them as ear cuff just did not work but they are great hanging like a regular earring
The climbers are even better than I thought. Very pleased with this order! Lightning fast shipping. Will order again!
"This style had the perfect style of gems and length I was looking for, and was a great value. The business was very communicative and considerate (Covid related delays)."
I love these climbers! I needed solid rose gold bc I wear them 24/7 and my previous plated gold climbers lost the gold. But I didn't want real diamonds in case I ever lost them. So these solid gold with CZ were the perfect combination. Very comfortable and sparkly
"Well The 14k two tone gold Gucci was beautiful but the size 2.5 that I got it was hard to see the two-tone! But That‚Äôs just my opinion. This being my first gold necklace, an Denize was wonderful I contacted her and I exchanged it for a solid Gold color marina, 14k gold necklace length 18‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Also purchased a second necklace 14k solid tricolor gold Valentino, 22‚Äù and I love that one too, both from Denize."
Absolutely beautiful workmanship! Very helpful and quick to reply with any questions. Will be certainly be back for more.
"I love this tiny ring! (I did not realize how small it was, but i love it!) I thoroughly freaked out my conservative parents, just a small perk of course. My friends think it's super cute, and it allows me to express myself, experiment with my style, without pain and commitment. I highly recommend! Also it came in a super cute little bag and packaging! If you are questioning it, just DO IT! Believe me!"
Super fast shipping and ear climber just as pictured. Very unique and beautiful piece to have in your collection. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thank you
"I love wearing dangly earrings, but masks make that cumbersome so I thought I‚Äôd try these...they‚Äôre so cool! Elegant but also a little badass, I love them. Extra credit given for their quick arrival in NY, and I also appreciate the time and resources that were put in to the packaging!"
"Tr√®s jolie montre tr√®s gaie et color√©e pour l'hiver, c'est le top ! Et en plus, faire un achat au profit de votre association c'est tr√®s important pour moi."
Merci beaucoup j'adore ces boucles d'oreilles. Bonne ann√©e 2020 tous les meilleurs ü§ó
"C'est magnifique, tout comme votre combat. Ma galga se joint √† moi pour vous souhaiter de joyeuses f√™tes et une ann√©e 2021 merveilleuse pour tous les galgos. Respect & Libert√©. Bien √† vous"
"Superbe tasse avec pour motif un l√©vrier qui s'endort. Je suis tr√®s contente √† l'id√©e de l'offrir √† une passionn√©e des l√©vriers ! De plus, je suis heureuse que cela serve une cause qui me tient √† coeur. Merci √† vous pour ce que vous fa√Ætes pour ces pauvres l√©vriers."
"Love my earings, really great quality! I do have to note that you may need help to put them in, as they are tiny and stiff. But once they are in, they will not fall off:) love them !"
"These hoops are super cute and dainty! They‚Äôre perfect for pairing with other hoops or even studs. A bit of a hassle to get on, but one you get them on they‚Äôre the perfect size. Shipping was fast, especially considering COVID. Overall a great purchase!"
Just as I hoped they would be. So pretty! I have searched for these bar earrings for over a year in just the right size. I absolutely adore them.
"I really like my earrings. Shiny, lightweight and interesting."
"The earrings look beautiful. I had assumed they were made with a light cardboard covered in African print. In fact they are quite thick, strong and heavier than most earrings of this design. They are slightly too long for me: the bottom edge touches my shoulders. If you like big, bulk earrings you'll love these because as I say, they are beautiful. They just weren't quite what I was looking for."
"Vom Material und von den Farben bin ich total begeistert. Allerdings sind sie doch etwas gro√ü. Wer sich die Beschreibung durchliest, ist echt im Vorteil. Im Sommer werde ich sie aber auf jeden Fall tragen. Sie sind wundersch√∂n."
Jolies boucles ! Tissu de qualit√© Emballage papier cadeau et livraison tr√®s rapide
They are absolutely beautiful. Bigger than I expected but beautiful
"I was so pleasantly surprised when I received these because they were more detailed and beautiful in person than what I saw on the picture. Unfortunately for me they didn‚Äôt fit my ears right, I have small ears so I‚Äôm not surprised, and when it reached out to the seller to ask for a return the customer service was phenomenal and the process was super easy. Even though this pair of earrings didn‚Äôt work out for me I will be looking for another pair through this seller"
"it fits well, especially the cuff. its snug but doesn't hurt, plus it's pretty!"
This mismatched pair of butterfly earrings is divine. They shipped and arrived quickly. Thank you!!!
"Gorgeous earrings! A little tight, but easy to pull looser."
Merveilleux service ! Tr√®s beaux produits
"Merci beaucoup √† l‚Äôartiste. Je suis tr√®s satisfaite du produit, de la rapidit√© d‚Äôexp√©dition et de la belle attention de la part de l‚Äôartiste."
"The best jewelry I‚Äôve ever had in my ears. Period. It‚Äôs so true when people say pictures don‚Äôt do these justice. I‚Äôve ordered cheaper jewelry from other shops before, and you definitely get what you pay for. I‚Äôm used to the jewelry looking better in the pictures, but not with this shop! I was shocked at just how beautiful everything was. And they are so nice, I didn‚Äôt know whether to get the 6mm or 8mm length labret for a conch piercing, and I went with the 6mm and left a note saying if they think the 8mm back would be better, to just send it instead, but they went ahead and sent both lengths!! Which I‚Äôm so thankful for since the 8mm ended up being the more comfortable size. I‚Äôll never order from another shop!! Customer for life."
"Finally found a curved eyebrow bar that was 12mm!! Excellent quality as well, a plus is the white fire opal ball. They look fire, now I‚Äôm trying to find different balls. Awesome site, they have my business!!"
"Absolutely lovely! Fits and feels like a dream. Came in a lovely little box alongside the other piece I ordered, and came with a lovely surprise in the package as well. Will be buying from this shop again sometime soon!"
"Love itt. Replaced my boring old metal piercing with opals! The sellers are great as well, and helped me out when the postal service was messing up my mail. I appreciate it so much!!"
Parfait
It is as pictured this is a present for my grand daughter she will love it this came from Belgium and was delivered in a quick manner very pleased
It arrived before the estimated time however it was a little too big as there was only one size. It was good quality as well.
Beautiful Ear climbers stud CZ curved earrings. Shipment arrived safely and on time packaged very well. Thank you GreatJewelry4All for the speedy delivery. Love them‚ù£Ô∏è
There are so cute! I like petite jewelry and these are perfectly to my liking. They are well-made and look just like the picture. Very pleased.
Omg! I absolutely looove these earrings!!! They are so beautiful! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Love, love, love, love them!"
"Po√©tique et vrai bijou √† la fois, d√©licat et f√©minin. Pour les petites comme pour les plus grandes. Je suis ravie, merci beaucoup !!! Vivement recommand√©."
Les boucles d'oreilles sont tops. Envoi rapide et emballage soign√©. Super!! üòä
"J'ai command√© 3 coussins musicaux, je les ai re√ßus dans un sachet tr√®s joli en textile, ce qui est un petit plus √©tant donn√© que ce sont des cadeaux. Les produits sont vraiment superbes et la qualit√© est au RDV. Virginie est disponible, √† l'√©coute, je vous la recommande vivement !"
Wouahou ! Plus que contente du r√©sultat ! Un petit bijou doux et moelleux. Merci √† Virginie pour sa gentillesse et sa rapidit√© et surtout son Talent !!
"Quality workmanship, beautifully wrapped! Very pleased, shop here with confidence!"
I got these earrings in silver. They look amazing and go with practically everything!
So cute! I‚Äôve already got compliments on them and this only the first day I‚Äôve worn them! Fast shipping too.
came really quick and so cool!
Very pretty!
I love them so much ! I‚Äôve owned a lot of climber style earrings. Some of the backings are really flimsy or too far apart to be able to squeeze them together to fit your ear. These ones are perfect !!!
Super cute!! I love how they are a little bit edgyüòç I highly recommend‚ù§Ô∏è
Love it! They are small and fit in my ear.
"My girlfriend was very happy and pleased with the beautiful earrings, she is a nurse and wears them at work. Contact with NLMSilverAndStone was very friendly, item was delivered on time, well packaged."
Very cute earing. I wish it came in gold.
Love it! Fits my tragus piercing perfectly!
This flower tragus earing is so cute. I should have gotten the pair.
Gorgeous ring online and even better in person. Super comfortable and I love wearing it! I got a size 8 for my index finger but also fits on my ring finger (7) without being too loose.
I ordered two sets of earrings and love them both! This open hoop is a little big for my ear but I just tilt it up and it works perfectly. I tried it in my first hole and ended up liking it better in my second.
"I love these earrings! Very dainty and modern. I love pairing the dot and the triangle together. I do find they can rotate a bit after sleeping on them, but I've worn them for a couple of weeks now and I've had no issues with them falling out at all! They stay put well and they're very comfortable to wear. I also have very sensitive ears and I've had no irritation with these! Would absolutely recommend these and get them again."
These are beyond gorgeous and the perfect size! Now I don't have to take all of my earrings out every night before bed because my head isn't being stabbed by the standard posts. I'm in love and never going back!
"So comfortable and adorable for everyday wear! I was confused with how to order a pair, the seller was helpful and honest when I ordered two single hoops and refunded me for the overpayment. If you want a pair, select 2 hoops; it doesn't mean it has two hoops, it means, you get a matching pair of single hoops!"
"I absolutely love the look of this earring! I went with option D and it is stunning! It is a little uncomfortable in my ear so I probably won't be wearing it for long periods of time, but I'm sure that's just because of my ear shape and has nothing to do with the products quality. Thank you so much!"
this earring is super pretty and it shipped almost right away! it came just in time for prom!
Cute! It's not real gold but no allergic reaction which is awesome because my ears are very sensitive. Seller cares about customer's opinions. Recommend them. I got some great compliments at work.
"Very cute and pretty comfy! It doesn't feel heavy on my ear. Shipped really fast! My only issue is that it slides a bit on my ear when I adjust my hair, but I think that's more the fault of my small ear than the earring."
"Un autre merveilleux achat de B√©atrice! C'est mon troisi√®me achat et B√©atrice ne d√©√ßoit jamais. Vendeur merveilleux, gentil et professionnel. Fournit les meilleurs et les plus beaux bijoux. Merci beaucoup!"
"Vendeur merveilleux! Quand je veux un bijou exemplaire, je fais confiance √† B√©atrice √† 100%! J'adore le pendentif. J'appr√©cie l'excellent service client et l'exp√©dition rapide! Merci beaucoup!"
This pendant is beyond my wildest dreams! The details are exquisite! The enamel and pearls are in mint condition -- so rare for something this fragile and 100+ years old. The seller is amazing and so kind. She included a beautiful notecard that I am going to frame -- yes even the packaging exceeds all expectations. I know that I will be back for more unique and precious treasures!
"This chain is even more beautiful in person. It is delicate, yet a showstopper! I cannot wait to wear it long, double, or tripled -- alone or with other necklaces. So versatile! Quick shipping, impeccable packaging, and even a sweet holiday card included! Another amazing experience!"
Merveilleux service ! Tr√®s beaux produits
"Merci beaucoup √† l‚Äôartiste. Je suis tr√®s satisfaite du produit, de la rapidit√© d‚Äôexp√©dition et de la belle attention de la part de l‚Äôartiste."
"These pearl earrings that I purchased from TerraFinds are delicate and extremely lovely. They are just the right size. They are very feminine. I do business with TerraFinds because I know I will never be disappointed. Terra is always here to lend a helping hand and her expertise. I LOVE HER!!!!! Each pearl is hand picked. Keep that in mind when you want QUALITY PEARLS. She offers many different sizes, colors and prices of pearls. She also offers accessories to make pearl jewelry. I couldn't buy a single pearl without TerraFinds. dkm"
"I love the way these hang on my ears. I cannot wear french hook style earrings so I was happy to find something that ""dangled"" that was post style and so pretty in it's simplicity."
Very cute and classy. I do wish I custom ordered a pair to lessen the drop as I have very small ears. But I love them this way too.
LOVE these. Thank you!!!

"These earrings are SO light, you don't feel like you're even wearing anything. You can also reverse the bottom piece to reveal a black side to change it up to a silver/black earring! I love them!"
These earrings look and feel amazing. They are lightweight and so cool!!
"Lightweight, beautiful earrings. I look forward to wearing them out (when I can go out again...). :)"
These are so lovely and lightweight! Can't wait to wear them on wedding day.
"My customized climber arrived fast, in beautiful, sparkling condition, and I'm obsessed! The seller is super sweet and helpful. My new favorite jeweler! Thank you so much!"
"I love this climber earring. I thought it would be bigger, but it fits my ear perfectly. Next time I'll get one that goes all the way up my ear. This one goes about half way. I got the right side only- to wear during my wedding ceremony. It's very comfortable."
"Definite show stoppers! My ears a bit small for the top claps, but I will sort it out. Beautiful!"
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much!

"tr√®s jolies mais petites! pas tr√®s solides donc j'ai du renforcer √† la colle forte au niveau du ""fermoir"". La livraison est tr√®s rapide, l'emballage est parfait ! je recommande"
Le masque est tr√®s beau et le tissus magnifique. Le fait de pouvoir choisir l'√©paisseur les √©lastiques... est un r√©el plus! Et l'espace pour introduire un filtre est g√©nial. Un grand merci pour ce beau travail !
"Merci pour votre envoi tr√®s rapide, je suis tr√®s contente de mes achats, les boucles d'oreille sont tr√®s belles m√™me si un peu lourdes je les mettrai avec plaisir. Le bracelet est magnifique aussi. Conformes √† la photo, et m√™me plus beaux en vrai."
"Envoi tr√®s rapide, communication tr√®s agr√©able, et les boucles d'oreilles sont tr√®s jolies. Merci !"
"I really admire the craftsmanship and the style. I would have given 5* for customer service and honouring my request to have it smoothed out. Only I didn't know that I had to adjust them a little to fit my lobe (would have been useful advice). Really excited out the box and wore them out without a second thought, only to find them hanging like down like costume jewellery from a sci-fi movie--which is not the look I was going for. Lesson learnt...take the time to adjust to your earlobe for a snug fit unless you like idea of them slowly transforming into low hangers. Other than that, if you like simple unique chic pieces that speaks volumes, get it touch with this seller. It may be just what your heart desires."
From beginning to end this was a wonderful shopping experience. I had questions regarding how I should order and if it‚Äôs one size fits all. I was explained everything! I submitted a picture of my ear as well to help with fit for the curvature of my ear and she created it from there. Needless to say it‚Äôs perfect!!!
I received my climbers today although a little late ( because of the bank holiday) they are beautiful and just what I wanted. Love to Jasmine who was very helpful Would definitely recommend
Even better than I imagined. A custom piece as wanted it shorter. Communicated with ease and I love the end product! Can not fault and I will be purchasing from seller again
These earrings are the fourth item I buy from Natalia; everything I have bought from her has been stunning and delicate. The design is a perfect blend of minimalist and expressive. I just can't recommend Natalia's shop enough!
"Natalia was an absolute joy to order from. She was very communicative. I picked the stones I wanted and after she made the ring she sent me three photos to check that I was happy with how it looked before she sent it. The package arrived in a timely manner and the ring was well protected. The box was beautiful, stamped, and an olive leaf tucked under the string. Most importantly the ring!! I love the ring. It is unusual, earthy and modern. It is surprisingly very comfortable to wear. I have been getting so many compliments. People love how unique and beautiful it is. Natalia is an amazing artist. Absolute perfection. Thank you Natalia!!!"
"love, love, love it! She sized it perfectly; love the asymmetrical design and unusual combination of an elegant pearl w/carnelian orange. Also, Natalia immediately rectified a situation on another order. She is highly recommended. I will be back. Eucharisto para poly!"
"I love unique jewelry (or ""conversation starters"" as I like to call them) and this shop is filled with beautiful unique pieces from top to bottom. I am thrilled with this ring and I'm looking forward to selecting more pieces in the future!"

"Love, love, love. This pair is well made, unique, BEAUTIFUL, versatile, chic and sexy! Leave it to the French! It's everything a woman can ask for! It's great for work and for play. I have gotten compliments everywhere. The fact that it's got both silver, gold AND ROSE gold tones on it means it gets a lot of mileage in the my wkly rotation. Will be sharing the name of the shop next time I'm asked! This was shipped FAST w/tracking and packaged ready to gift. SUPER PLEASED. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SHOP!!!"
De belles boucles d'oreilles achet√©es pour l'anniversaire de ma meilleure amie qui a ador√©e ! De m√™me que toutes les copines qui √©taient pr√©sentes ! Plusieurs d'entre elles m'ont d'ailleurs demand√© o√π je les avais eu !
"Les arums sont assez grandes mais leurs l√©g√®ret√©s les rends agr√©ables √† porter! Elles sont jolies, Douces et chic! J'adore !"
These are amazing and so lightweight! I love them!
"The earrings were lovely, good quality and arrived well and quickly through the post. Good communication from Abi re delivery so really happy with my purchase. They fit and stay climbing up my ear really well. Will buy from her again."
"LOVE these. Ordered as a gift for my sister, but now I need some for myself. Hand made, great shape and fit. Came in lovely packaging too."
very nice earrings. Quick to arrive
"Really delicate, gorgeous earrings. Great quality, beautifully crafted - they are exactly as they look. Well packaged and arrived quickly in a fab presentation box. Can‚Äôt wait to give them to my sister. Thank you!"
these and everything I've bought look better than they do online wich usually isn't the case with online jewelry shopping . my girlfriend loves these earrings and they match the bracelet i bought previously like they were a matching set. if i could give more stars i would
"The earrings are absolutely gorgeous and both the silver and lapis lazuli quality are extraordinary. It is difficult times with COVID-19 and I had no rush to get them any time soon as a birthday gift for one of my good friends, but I received them in less than a week upon purchasing them. I am very thankful with the Etsy online shop owner. Thank you! ¬°Muchas gracias!"
"The item arrived 2 days later than advised by email, but still within a week. It was packaged securely for shipping and attractively boxed and ribboned inside. One earring of the pair was in perfect condition and the other one slightly less so; the silver edging around the stone wasn't quite as nicely done. All in all, the simple design of the earrings was exactly what I was looking for, and they look so lovely when worn with my blue sandstone and silver pendant necklace!"
"I have 2 pairs of round studs and a set of pearl studs from this seller- the pearls are my favorite, i love the little silver petals- that very subtle detail is very nice. The 2 round stone earrings are surrounded in Silver and are nice- quite thick, which I was hoping would have been less, but they are pretty. Long posts (which I like)."
"Love them. Wish the rose gold was a little more pink toned because they can kind of look yellow gold in some light. But I still like them and they wear ok for the day but because they are ear hooks you have to take them out before sleeping or they slip off your ear. Other than those little things, love them."
I love these beautiful earrings and can absolutely recommend them. Shipping was fast and I got them in a nice little box :)
They are just beautiful! Premium craftsmanship and gorgeous!
"I love it, love it, love it!"
"Beautiful jewellery, great quality and shipped really quickl. The colours in the picture were almost exactly as they were in real life and matched my wedding dress and colour theme perfectly! Would definitely buy from here again and recommend to friends and family :-)"
Absolutely beautiful! I am so glad I have found the perfect earrings.
Beautiful earring set! High quality. Seller was very helpful and worked with me when I had an issue. Can't wait to wear them out!
These are absolutely stunning!
"Love, love, love. This pair is well made, unique, BEAUTIFUL, versatile, chic and sexy! Leave it to the French! It's everything a woman can ask for! It's great for work and for play. I have gotten compliments everywhere. The fact that it's got both silver, gold AND ROSE gold tones on it means it gets a lot of mileage in the my wkly rotation. Will be sharing the name of the shop next time I'm asked! This was shipped FAST w/tracking and packaged ready to gift. SUPER PLEASED. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SHOP!!!"
Je suis tr√®s contente de l'article. C'√©tait pour un cadeau et il a beaucoup plus ! Sarayana est tr√®s rapide dans les √©changes et soigne tout jusqu'√† l'emballage un vrai plaisir :)
"These earrings are you beautiful! What is cool is that you can vary the size, because the back part has three holes to choose to connect with the front part. Plus the packaging showed a lot of attention to detail. Thank you!"
"Collier redimensionn√© pour √™tre adapt√© √† ma taille de cou, et il retombe parfaitement ! Idem pour 2 bracelets sur mesure ! La qualit√© est d√©finitivement au rendez-vous, et la douceur du cuir est absolument incroyable ! Merci beaucoup √©galement pour la rapidit√© d'exp√©dition, alors que les trois articles √©taient une demande personnalis√©e !! Je recommande vivement ce travail formidable r√©alis√© par une personne vraiment attentionn√©e ! Merci ! Je n'h√©siterais pas √† repasser commande d√®s que l'occasion se fera :)"
These earrings are absolutely gorgeous. They look just like the photo and are dazzling in person.
very very cute earrings i love them so much!! they are so unique and probably my new favorite earrings! plus I feel like Yoon Se-ri while wearing them‚ú®
Gorgeous!
Received earrings in 5 days. Thanks so much. They are beautiful and I love them.
these and everything I've bought look better than they do online wich usually isn't the case with online jewelry shopping . my girlfriend loves these earrings and they match the bracelet i bought previously like they were a matching set. if i could give more stars i would
"The earrings are absolutely gorgeous and both the silver and lapis lazuli quality are extraordinary. It is difficult times with COVID-19 and I had no rush to get them any time soon as a birthday gift for one of my good friends, but I received them in less than a week upon purchasing them. I am very thankful with the Etsy online shop owner. Thank you! ¬°Muchas gracias!"
"The item arrived 2 days later than advised by email, but still within a week. It was packaged securely for shipping and attractively boxed and ribboned inside. One earring of the pair was in perfect condition and the other one slightly less so; the silver edging around the stone wasn't quite as nicely done. All in all, the simple design of the earrings was exactly what I was looking for, and they look so lovely when worn with my blue sandstone and silver pendant necklace!"

Merveilleux service ! Tr√®s beaux produits
"Merci beaucoup √† l‚Äôartiste. Je suis tr√®s satisfaite du produit, de la rapidit√© d‚Äôexp√©dition et de la belle attention de la part de l‚Äôartiste."
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d‚Äôoreilles, de belle qualit√©. Charmant petit bracelet gentiment offert !"
"I received a parcel! Everything is fine. Thanks for the earrings and the gift bracelet, I really like everything!"
Fantastic earrings and great delivery !!! With a beautiful gift üíù thank you very much
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
"Beautiful!! The seller was very attentive and fast to respond. They went out of their way to accommodate my custom request. I wanted specific colors, and they created exactly what I wanted. I get so many compliments. I definitely recommend this seller. Customer service is excellent."
"Really stunning earrings! I bought these to wear at my wedding in July, and I can‚Äôt wait. I was looking for just this shape, and an arrangement that would hug my ear lobe as opposed to dropping down from it and this is perfect."
What a great product and fast delivery! Communication and answering of questions was also effortless and quick and the delivered product was astonishing and as described! I wore the earcuffs in a gala dance party and everyone was imazed! See full picture here: https://www.instagram.com/p/CDm2ht3hrzq/?igshid=hp3l3xsex8g9
"Just wanted to let you know that I received my earrings and I am as delighted as I was, the first time I ordered. These climbers make for excellent ""everyday"" earrings and I get lots of compliments on them. I ordered a pair in gold as well. Great products, great shop."
"The climbers were a little larger than I expected (or I just have small earlobes) but they're well-made and the climber ""stalk"" has enough space that my earlobes sit comfortably while the climbers are stable in place. They look lovely and they were quickly dispatched. Thanks!"
"I fell in love with this one, thanks!"
"Very nice design, lightweight, and here is the best part: completely compatible with my industrial style headphones. I can wear them, or earbuds, or anything, without slightest pressure or discomfort to the ear. Slick and modern, and works with multiple styles. Highly recommend."
"Les b.o. sont magnifiques et chic, conformes √† la photo. Emballage professionnel de qualit√©, dans une bo√Æte rigide pour plus de protection. Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de ce vendeur et je le recommande. Bravo et merci ! Anne"
"These sweet and bright 'fruit slice' earrings are perfect with a matching necklace I ordered. The set just shouts, ""let's have summer fun!"" Great designer!"
"Bonjour, ces boucles sont adorables, belles couleurs !! un peu de gaiet√© en cette p√©riode d√©licate. Commande re√ßue rapidement et bien emball√©e, merci √† Maeva que je conseille sans h√©sitation !!"
"Elles sont divines ces boucles d'oreilles, j'ai un vrai coup de coeur üíï Elles sont tr√®s √©l√©gantes, et ces couleurs dans les tons turquoise : j'adore!!"
The bow hair clip was a lot smaller than the picture shows and had a alligator clip instead of a barrette clip. I expected it to be a barrette clip due to the way it is styled on the back of the head and an alligator clip is much harder to get an even section of hair from both sides. The moon and pearl also look a bit cheap. I would not recommend purchasing this.
Sorry that you are not happy with this product . I did mention in the description that the bow was an alligator clip. I also put the size of the bow to avoid confusion .
"Super pretty and arrived quick! I have tiny ears so was a little big for me, but that's every ear cuff I've ever bought so üòÇ"
Excellent service from ordering to delivery. This item was bought as a birthday gift for my ‚Äúdragon girl‚Äù. She loves it and it looks so lovely on her ear. I was looking for a gift that was personal and a bit different. You sent me the perfect gift. Thank you.
"Very good, you can also adjust where the piercing goes in so this was handy as I've got fairly big ears"
J'ai demand√© une cr√©ation personnalis√©e et j'ai re√ßu exactement ce que je voulais. Notre communication est tr√®s bien pass√©e. Alors je suis ravie !! un grand merci pour votre √©coute et votre cr√©ativit√©
"Juste magnifique !!! Merci pour ces superbes boucles d'oreille, √† tr√®s vite pour ma prochaine commande qui ne devrait pas tarder üòâ"
Tellement heureuse de ces boucles je l‚Äôai met tous les jours ! Service client parfait et en plus un petit cadeau √† la r√©ception.
Parfaites !! Merci encore pour la 2nde boucle refaite c'est un plaisir d'√©changer avec toi !!
I wore these on my wedding day and got so many compliments I am really sensitive to metal and they were perfect. I 1000% recommend them in working with the buyer was extremely easy and she was very nice.
I absolutely love them :)
"Super cute. I always get compliments when I wear them. If you're in the U.S. know you'll need to allow additional time for these to process through customs. Otherwise, seamless experience."
Very cute and delicate earrings! They shipped super fast and look fantastic. Been wearing them everyday and they do not irritate my sensitive ears! Only concern is that the backings aren't always the most secure - I do have to check them and have woken up with the earring having slipped off into my bed sometimes.
"Chic, love them"
"J'adore. Cette simplicit√©, cette √©l√©gance... J'avais rep√©r√© ces petites merveilles faites main, mais j'h√©sitais √† acheter du rouge et, depuis que monochromatique en fait de toutes les couleurs - et qu'on peut les marier √† loisir- je me suis l√¢ch√©e. Une noire, une orange, une jaune et une blanche! Yes, je like :) En outre et √ßa ne g√¢che rien, elles ont √©t√© exp√©di√©es avec c√©l√©rit√© et sont arriv√©es tr√®s vite."
This is my favorite Etsy shop for a reason. Everything is even better than expected and it is so fast! Keep it up!
"as with everything i‚Äôve ordered from isabelle, the quality, customer service and attention to detail was exceptional."
I highly recommend this earring! the shipment was very fast and maytal is super nice and very responsive. looks just like the photo :)
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
I purchased these ear climbers for my daughter as a gift. She loved them. They are beautiful and unique. I hesitated about ordering internationally but decided to take the chance considering they were my favorite when compared to many others listed. Maytal was in close contact with me throughout the shipping process with delays as expected due to the pandemic. Her customer service and concern were superb...she updated me frequently until they arrived at my post office. I would not hesitate in ordering from her in the future.

Love it. So different looking I receive compliments every time I wear it. Thank you
Not my favorite. I buy a lot of these climbers and this one felt very breakable. It measures correctly but on the average ear it doesn‚Äôt go all the way up like pictured. It‚Äôs an odd shape that doesn‚Äôt sit comfortably on the ear which maybe difficult because everyone has different ear shapes. The earnings came in a very tiny ring box and were slightly bent when I received them. Not worth the 53 dollars I spent.
"The items are beautiful, nicely handcrafted with a lovely and delicate design. They fit elegantly on the ears. The seller is an absolute star: the parcel got lost on the way and the seller simply resend the goods via courrier at no extra cost. Thank you so much!"
The earrings are beautiful and I‚Äôm grateful they arrived to be an Christmas gift.
BEAUTIFUL ear cuffs! I cannot wait to wear them somewhere. I don't even know how to explain with words how pretty they are ... ha! It's my first set of ear cuffs and I'm afraid nothing will compare to them in the future. Thank you!
Gorgeous and very unique. The design is so elegant and looks beautiful kn! Thank you! Fast shipping was a plus!
"my first pair of the pins, easy to wear and have gotten many compliments. will be buying more!"
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I will be back!
The brooch looks cute! Nice quality. Shipping took pretty long with the first package lost but the seller even send it again for me. Good communication and she is very responsive!
"lovely earrings, exactly as pictured and really look like the real thing. can't believe how real they look. very happy! üôÇ"
Amazing brooch. Great value. You feel good wearing it and doubling it with a another (different) one.
"Love these earrings! They have an interesting simplicity. I have long hair and so like earrings that can be seen and make a bit of a statement, not ones that are so tiny you can barely see them (as bird earrings often are). These earrings fit the bill perfectly. They arrived in good time and I have been wearing them constantly ever since. Would happily recommend both them and this seller."
"Perfect! I really love my monstera leafs, they're perfect and look gorgeous on the wall!!! Pretty simple to fix with 3M Command temporary adhesivs :) Thank you!!!"
"This set of earrings was well worth the wait! They are beautifully shaped and detailed, and I love the delicate way they dangle. I chose the smaller size and am happy with my purchase. The shop shipped my order the day after I placed it. Unfortunately due to mail delays, the item took about 2 months to arrive, but this was not the fault of the shop. In fact, when I reached out, she offered to send me a new pair in case mine were lost in the mail. After that, she kept me updated on the package's shipping status through the tracking number. Very good customer service. I will buy here again!"
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I will be back!
Purchased this as a gift for a teenage girl and she loved them.
"Holy cow I ADORE these earrings! Beautiful, understated, and came super fast. Pro tip you have to twist them in backwards (from the back of your piercing instead of the front) to get them to lay right--took me wayy to long to figure out but was super easy once I did!"
"I love these earrings! I wore them for prom and get soooo many compliments, they weren‚Äôt too heavy either!"
I absolutely love these earrings! They arrived quickly and the seller left a sweet note with it. I‚Äôve already started receiving compliments on them!

I expected it to be a barrette clip due to the way it is styled on the back of the head and an alligator clip is much harder to get an even section of hair from both sides.

I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!"
"Absolutely love these earrings! I was hesitant to purchase them at first because they‚Äôre a bit pricey, but I looked everywhere and kept coming back to this design. Simple yet unique and elegant with great shine! Not too clunky - exactly what I was looking for! Shipped and delivered super fast!"
"These are the most sparkly and beautiful earrings I have ever owned! I was worried about getting dangle earrings because sometimes they hurt. These ones are perfect! I'm allergic to most types of earrings and these don't hurt, I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! They absolutely perfect!!"
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles, je suis ravie ! Elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s rapidement qui plus est. Je recommande cette boutique. Merci aussi pour la petite attention dans le paquet !"

"I loved everything about this purchase! Not only was my Siena Climber beautiful, and well made. But it was a joy to shop with Andrea. She was very responsive, and shipped my order very quickly. It was nicely packaged, and perfect for gifting - even though I was gifting it to myself. I know that these pretty, minimalist climbers are going to be a staple in my wardrobe."
These are so beautiful and you can tell the artist puts a lot of love into making these! Easy porch pick up for locals and a quality product!
These earrings are fab. They're so pretty and different from my other earrings. Really love them.
So beautiful and delicate! These are the perfect subtle staple piece.
I am just in love. These have been on my favourites list for well over a year and I do ally bought them for my upcoming wedding! I wish I‚Äôd bought them sooner. They are absolutely stunning. Definitely an eye catching accessory and just like the picture. They arrived really quickly too! 5 stars all round!
What a great product and fast delivery! Communication and answering of questions was also effortless and quick and the delivered product was astonishing and as described! I wore the earcuffs in a gala dance party and everyone was imazed! See full picture here: https://www.instagram.com/p/CDm2ht3hrzq/?igshid=hp3l3xsex8g9
This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are
"I so much love my new pair of very elegant and stylish clear crystal ear climbers. Their so well made and look like the real thing. The Crystal ear climbers are a great statement piece that can be worn dressy or casual and will make any outfit look amazing. The purchase and shipping was a very pleasant experience, will be purchasing more items from this company/ brand again!!! Thank You, Gretchen"

I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"I love the these! I have been looking for jackets for my studs, and these are so fun!"
"It was longer than I anticipated, so I couldn't use it for what I'd intended, but still love it."
This is the second piece I have purchased from this shop and it's just as beautiful as the other one! Thank you so much for the excellent craftsmanship and details! ‚ú®
My sister loved this for Christmas! I ordered some tunnels for myself that haven't showed up yet but I am super stoked for them
I wore these for my wedding and they were absolutely stunning. Packaging and quality of the earrings was perfect. And they were very comfortable!
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
"Beautiful earrings! And thank you for expediting shipping, I was able to wear these to my wedding and they were perfect."
Item got here super quickly and I love it! It looks great by itself or in my second hole with a dangly earring in the front. The curve of it makes it go up my ear perfectly.
"Received an invoice immediately after purchase and a tracking number shortly thereafter. My item arrived well packaged within a short period and the item is just as pictured‚Äîvery beautiful and well made! Easy to insert, though a bit tough to get to stay on my (probably strange) ear. :) Luckily it‚Äôs sturdy enough to stand up to some careful manipulation. Thanks so much!"
Much more delicate than I expected (in a good way)!
The earrings are lovely. My daughter is going to flip out when she gets them on Christmas. Great quality and quick delivery. Thank you!!!
Excellente qualit√©! J‚Äôai enfin un bracelet de cheville qui va passer tout l‚Äô√©t√©! Et une artisane tr√®s sympathique qui personnalise selon vos go√ªts :D Je recommande +++
Merci ! Je les aime √©norm√©ment! Tr√®s belle qualit√© et envoi rapide üíöüíöüíö
Magnifique!
"These are so cute! I love how they're light, I love the fox design, and the green bead gives it a quirky profile. I would buy this again, given an orange bead!"
"First, let me say, I love this jewelry. That's why I gave it 5 stars. I love the Aloha necklace with the Blue Peruvian together. I will say, they are a lot daintier than I thought they were going to be. Not a bad thing, but I just wasn't expecting that. I'm a little nervous about breaking the chain. But, like I said, not a bad thing, just couldn't tell from the pictures how lite/small these pieces are. Again. Love the jewelry, and would buy from her again. Shipping took a little longer than expected, but I am in Boston and they are coming from Cali. Also, Cheryl was very accommodating and sweet in her replies to email questions I had. Also, the package came with a very nice handwritten note from Cheryl. Always nice to have a personal touch!"

But, like I said, not a bad thing, just couldn't tell from the pictures how lite/small these pieces are. Again. Love the jewelry, and would buy from her again. Shipping took a little longer than expected, but I am in Boston and they are coming from Cali. Also, Cheryl was very accommodating and sweet in her replies to email questions I had. Also, the package came with a very nice handwritten note from Cheryl. Always nice to have a personal touch!"
"OBSESSED with this necklace. I've wanted it for probably a year now and have kept my eye on it -- just recently decided to buy. It's gorgeous and so well made. The lettering isn't exactly like the photo but that doesn't bother me. Great seller, great necklace, fast turnaround time! Thanks so much!"
"First, let me say, I love this jewelry. That's why I gave it 5 stars. Fits my wrist perfectly and I have smaller wrists. I have a hard time finding jewelry that I can tighten around my wrist to my liking. I will say, it is a lot daintier than I thought it was going to be. Not a bad thing, but I just wasn't expecting that. I'm a little nervous about breaking the chain. But, like I said, not a bad thing, I just couldn't tell from the pictures how thin this bracelet is. Again. Love the jewelry, and would buy from her again. Shipping took a little longer than expected, but I am in Boston and they are coming from Cali. Also, Cheryl was very accommodating and sweet in her replies to email questions I had. Also, the package came with a very nice handwritten note from Cheryl. Always nice to have a personal touch!"

Satisfaite du suivi et temps de livraison et messagerie de la cr√©atrice de la Petite Boutique 75 mes mini cr√©oles correspondent √† mon coup de coeur !!!
"Je n'ai que des compliments sur les mini cr√©oles Lisa. Le rendu de la couleur or, du martel√© du noir et de la pierre est sublime et d'un chic absolu. L'emballage est soign√© comme le bijou. Je recommande cette boutique et sa cr√©atrice."
Ces boucles sont sublimes ! Je n‚Äôai qu‚Äôune h√¢te pouvoir recommander !
"This is the second 5 star review and time I bought these gorgeous earrings. The first time was for a wedding gift, for my best friend. This time, it's for me! FAST shipping & lovely packaging. Bravo! Also, these beautiful rose gold earrings are super comfortable to wear, they stay put too (w/NO pinched feeling). New favorites."
"I absolutely love these earrings. They‚Äôre beautiful and perfect for date night! Also, super easy to take on and off, but stay in place all night."
I absolutely love these earrings! I bought three pair! One for my daughter and one for my best friend and myself. This designer is amazing and sends everything in a cute little box and I received it right away. Great seller!!!
Beautiful ear climber earrings! I am so happy I went with the rose gold!
"Bonjour, Je souhaitais revenir sur cette premi√®re commande pour vous faire part de ma satisfaction. En effet, command√© pendant la p√©riode des f√™tes de fin d'ann√©e, j'ai eu la tr√®s agr√©able surprise de recevoir ces BO dans les meilleurs d√©lais (moins de 3 jours !) avec toute le s√©rieux dont est capable ""Flaure"" : ponctualit√©, emballage +++, petit mot plein d'attentions et enfin le magnifique article : encore plus joli ""en vrai"" !!!

De Ravissantes boucles ! !
These earrings are even better in person!!! They are adorable and unusual - I've worn them multiple times already and are one of my very favorites!
"Je poursuis mon commentaire qui tient compte de la paire de BO pr√©c√©dentes (BO coeur argent√©)... En tout point, et comme d'habitude avec La Boutique de Flaure, les cr√©ations sont fid√®les aux photos et m√™me plus jolies encore ! La livraison est tr√®s rapide, les informations concernant les d√©lais pr√©cises et SURTOUT : quel ravissement et quelle d√©licatesse dans les emballages (bien que sans avoir pr√©ciser qu'il s'agissait d'un cadeau). Je vous recommande encore et encore cette cr√©atrice. Je ne me lasse pas de son univers !"
"Bonne communication avec la vendeuse, je suis ravie de mon achat. Le bracelet de cheville est tr√®s beau, je l'adore ! Et un grand merci pour le bracelet en cadeau !"
"Beautiful, functional, and on a strong cord. Just what I needed. I am very pleased with the color and size of the rudraksha beads. Heavy black onyx beads are very nice too."
Parfait cadeau de f√™te des m√®res elle √©tais ravi ! Petit b√©mol la longueur pour ma part qui n‚Äôa pas une cheville fine ! Sinon parfait et vendeuse tr√®s agr√©able ma m√™me envoy√© en jolie cadeau un petit bracelet tr√®s jolie.
"J'aime beaucoup ce bracelet. Les perles sont douces et le bois prend des couleurs de plus en plus chaudes. Tr√®s joli, tr√®s agr√©able √† porter."
"I have got 3 pairs of earrings, a ring and an ear cuff and I love every item! The quality, design...you can just see the love Julie puts in her jewelry...next buy will be a necklace ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you!"

Exp√©dition tr√®s rapide de la commande. Merci beaucoup pour le soin apport√© √† l'emballage du colis. J'aime beaucoup ces tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles !!!

Je suis ravie de cette premi√®re commande.
"These just didn‚Äôt look as expected, but were still pretty."
These earrings are super cute and I bought them for my mom and she loves them!!
"Dainty rocker chic, my picky Ass sister loves it!"
"Well made!!! This style of earring is something new for me. I usually wear hoops, and I wanted something different...they have more style then just stud earrings. Very pleased! Thank you!"
"Love these earrings! So simple, delicate and perfect for everyday. I was on the hunt for something that goes with everything and doesn't have a back poking me constantly. I've already shared the link with friends and family. To top it off, very fast shipping!"
"I love these! Bought the gold for my sister and silver for me, but I'm keeping the gold. These are simple, yet so beautiful! They look great in my second piercing. They shipped lightening fast and were packaged in a beautiful box. I hope Jill keeps making these forever because I will be buying more!"
Love these ear climbers! I have ridiculously small ears and these are the perfect size. They're very comfortable and I don't have to worry about losing any backs!
Tr√®s jolies boucles. Bonne qualit√©. Bon rapport qualit√© prix Je suis ravie. Merci üôÇ
"Les pierres n'ont pas une forme tr√®s r√©guli√®re et une des cha√Ænes tourne, mais sinon c'est un prix raisonnable pour une √©meraude...."
Juste magnifique encore plus beau en vrai !! Je le pensais plus petit sur la photo du site. La pierre est de tr√®s bonne qualit√© et il va partager mon quotidien. Je suis √©galement ravie qu‚Äôon mets r√©ponds √† mes messages rapidement.
"Pierre vraiment plus claire et plus ""fade"" que sur la photo"
"My customized climber arrived fast, in beautiful, sparkling condition, and I'm obsessed! The seller is super sweet and helpful. My new favorite jeweler! Thank you so much!"
"I love this climber earring. I thought it would be bigger, but it fits my ear perfectly. Next time I'll get one that goes all the way up my ear. This one goes about half way. I got the right side only- to wear during my wedding ceremony. It's very comfortable."
"Definite show stoppers! My ears a bit small for the top claps, but I will sort it out. Beautiful!"
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much!
These are exactly as described! I am very happy.
"Nice, sturdy clasp, looking forward to having it on my omega necklace. Haven‚Äôt been able to wear both sides of chain because the old clasp was a standard type that did not accommodate the white vs yellow gold chain sides. Fast shipping, very responsive to questions and very accommodating! Thank you Christine for the service and quality merchandise too. All future needs will bring me back here before I look elsewhere. By the way, my jeweler wanted to sock it to me and charge me $168 for the same clasp. I‚Äôve had this chain for so long now that the clasp would have been more than I paid for the chain over 15 years ago. Trustworthy seller, if unsure, please reconsider, I have no regrets!"
I‚Äôve waited so long for a Star of David Cross!! I already had the 14k gold ball chain to match with it! This piece holds a lot of personal meaning for me and the rose gold cross in the middle pick up the rose gold rose flower in my other piece. It brings everything together!
Love these thanks
Beautiful statement earrings! Look forward to wearing them. :)
This facemask is absolutely gorgeous!!! The rose gold Swarovski crystals are outstanding. A picture does not do them justice. A must see in person. This mask is also well made and fits well. I received this mask in two days!!! It shipped immediately. This Seller has never disappointed me! I will continue to make purchases from this Sellers shop on Etsy!!!
I brought this mask for my daughter to wear to her Senior prom and it matched her dress PERFECTLY!! üòçüñ§
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! The sparkle when the light hits them. I am so excited to wear them in my upcoming pageant!!

"Assez d√©√ßue. Les boucles d‚Äôoreille sont jolies mais je ne crois pas trop qu‚Äôelles sont faites main vu le packaging qui a l‚Äôair de venir de Chine. Je redoute donc la qualit√© vs le prix pay√©. Assez d√©√ßue de la vendeuse aussi qui a refus√© d‚Äôannuler la commande me disant qu‚Äôelle ne pouvait pas alors qu‚Äôelle n‚Äô√©tait pas encore exp√©di√©e, et qui n‚Äôest pas du tout arrangeante ni agr√©able."
"Merci beaucoup pour ce beau bracelet jonc qui est arriv√© en parfait √©tat, c‚Äôest un cadeau qui a √©norm√©ment plu √† sa destinataire, je recommande la boutique S√©lection parisienne ‚òÄÔ∏è üëçüèº"

Bien s√ªr j ai envoy√© un mail aucune r√©ponse !! je met une √©toile car pas le choix mais si j avais pu mettre 0 je l aurais fait !!"
"I got these earrings for my wedding day. I tried them out during my bachelorette and found them very uncomfortable, but realized it was because had tightened the little knob on top too tight. I wore them for my wedding day, from 11AM to 12AM, and let me say I didn‚Äôt even feel them (I tightened the knob the right amount that time). Everyone loved them so much! They are beyond gorgeous and so edgy. I got the pair so my mom and I could each wear one. I‚Äôve kept on using them for outings and everyone is always complimenting me on them! Arrived within a couple of weeks, which is a plus! Love them!"
"Stunning earring, we are a shop that start work with Maya Valentino, the quality and service is great! Thank you Tommy!!"
Absolutely beautiful!
I purchased the crystal and emerald ear crawl earrings for my daughter to wear on her wedding day in September. They're beautiful and she loves them. It took some time to receive them from Israel but they did come sooner than predicted.
"Love these! Unique, shipped quickly, and I am already getting compliments after wearing for the first time. Love love love!"
These are my first ear climbers and I LOVE them!!
My new favorites!!!
Loved the packaging! I bought these earrings for my niece. She loved them! The best part for me is that I didn‚Äôt have to wrap it. It came in a cute box and a nice bow wrapped around it. Thank you!
Tres contente du produit command√© et envoy√© rapidement ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Oh my received a week ago and I am still amazed. Just gorgeous the wrapping was so special. Thanks!! Carolann Davis
"I am very happy, that I found this beautiful and unique earrings. They are very special and I love to wear them. Shipment was very fast, so I got the order all the way from US to Germany within 9 working days (longest stay was at german customs). Thank you Marlo for great service and contact. All the best for you!"
Love these earrings. Just the right size I had in mind.Just perfect!
"The seller's communication was excellent. The three pieces arrived in just a few days, each in its own decorative box. The set, by Coventry, made for a perfect 26th anniversary present for my wife to who loved it."
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
"Shipped faster than expected. And it‚Äôs the perfect size! I haven‚Äôt taken it out since I got it. Seriously, my favorite for my rook."
I am just in love. These have been on my favourites list for well over a year and I do ally bought them for my upcoming wedding! I wish I‚Äôd bought them sooner. They are absolutely stunning. Definitely an eye catching accessory and just like the picture. They arrived really quickly too! 5 stars all round!
"Love them! I was worried at first when i tried them on that they wouldn't fit around the cartilage ear, but with the hinge joint it fits just fine and holds like a dream!"
What a great product and fast delivery! Communication and answering of questions was also effortless and quick and the delivered product was astonishing and as described! I wore the earcuffs in a gala dance party and everyone was imazed! See full picture here: https://www.instagram.com/p/CDm2ht3hrzq/?igshid=hp3l3xsex8g9
"I can't get enough of these, they are beautifully made, amazing quality, great service and i always get complimented on my earrings from Maya Valentino! Will definitely be purchasing again!"
"Tout est conforme, elles sont vraiment tr√®s belle, re√ßu rapidement, seul petit b√©mol la taille, je ne me suis pas rendu compte qu'elle √©tait si grande dommage !!!"
"Bague magnifique, bijou fin et tr√®s agr√©able √† porter, conforme √† la description! je suis ravie de mon achat, envoi rapide (re√ßu 3 jours apr√®s avoir command√©!) emballage soign√©. Vendeur adorable, professionnel et √† l'√©coute! Je recommande sans h√©siter! Merci et √† tr√®s vite!"
"Superbe bracelet ! J'adore, emballage hyper soign√©, arriv√© rapidement. Le seul b√©mol que je peux noter c'est qu'il n'est pas pr√©vu pour de petits poignets fins comme les miens malgr√© qu'il puisse √™tre resserr√©... Mais malgr√© tout pas assez... Je l'adore en tout cas. Merci beaucoup !"
Ils sont g√©niaux je les adore
"Wonderful work, so beautiful and high quality. Incredible service and product, highly recommend! Arrived on time and very well packed! Thank you!"
Minimalistic and unique piece of jewelry. Love them!
Love them!! Very cute and different! Just what I was looking for!
Ich freue mich sehr √ºber diese wundersch√∂nen Ohrringe. Sehen aus wie auf dem Foto.
"Love these! I was a little nervous by looking at them that they‚Äôd be hard to put in, but that‚Äôs not the case at all. They are delicate and pretty and I forgot I actually had them in until I got complimented several times!"
"These climbers are stunning! Very lightweight sterling silver too! I don't feel as though they would slip down my ear at all! Very happy with my purchase, thank you üòä"
Beautiful ear clips!! Very satisfied!
"Truly beautiful, came quickly. Thanks!"
"un cadeau tr√®s appr√©ci√©, original !"
I am very pleased with my purchase. The items are of great quality and so creative. The cristals are beautiful. I love the bracelets and the earrings. I really recommend !
"B.O. plus petites que pr√©vu mais en revanche, Cristelle est tr√®s √† l'√©coute : elle m'a mont√© les B.O. sur les crochets en argent que j'avais inclus √† ma commande. Merci !"
"Tr√®s jolie citrine. Envoi soign√© avec petite grenouille en origami en cadeau, carte fleur de vie pour recharger les cristaux et bon de retour en cas de probl√®me. Cristelle pense √† tout. Les pierres sont plus grosses que ce que je croyais et pas trop irr√©guli√®res pour des chips. Rapport qualit√©-prix excellent, je recommande. Juste une petite suggestion : faire les colliers un peu plus courts et les bracelets un peu moins justes ! Je rach√®terai des bijoux dans cette boutique (merci Cristelle de m'avertir quand vous aurez de l'oeil de tigre et de la cornaline !)"
I was traveling and wasn‚Äôt able to pick up my earrings at the post office for several weeks. Artikats was in touch and so kind about helping me figure out how to get them. I finally did today and I love them! The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it was a little hard to get them on. I‚Äôve never bought ear jackets before and it‚Äôs a learning experience. üòÑ
"I actually reordered these because I lost my last set and loved them so much. They‚Äôre really comfortable and great for everyday wear - they don‚Äôt have posts to dig in to your neck, no hoops to snag in things. And sooo pretty!!"
"I absolutely love these adorable earrings! They are unique and special in an unflashy way. Also, they are very well crafted and good to wear for people with a tendendy to allergic reactions with earrings, like me."
My new favourites ! They are so shiny and make my appearance very light and sparkly ! Can be worn every day but also as a special piece at night. All round it`s the perfect earrings for me :-) Vasilia was also very helpful in providing updates on the delivery. I`ll come back for more !!
Great products. Just as pictured. Beautiful earrings.

"I have been getting so many compliments on these and rightfully so! I reached out to the seller to ask for a customization that wasn‚Äôt offered and she delivered with flying colors! Truly, OBSESSED. They are so beautiful and dainty, yet strong material that I won‚Äôt feel will bend if I brush up against someone accidentally or cut a corner too soon. I love these earrings and the other ones I bought so much. I‚Äôve always been hesitant about buying handmade earrings due to worries about being symmetrical, but these are! Thank you thank you thank you!!"
"I. Love. These. Earrings. The seller is not just talented, but is so welcoming and thoughtful. These are the perfect boho/statement/any season earrings. Lightweight and can be worn with anything. I highly recommend this shop and as soon as I‚Äôm done writing this review, I will be selecting new items to purchase from her! I‚Äôm so happy with my purchase. Thank you!!!!!"
Seller contacted me with extra options to ensure I got exactly what I wanted. She made the pieces very quickly and sent photos of the finished products. They turned out absolutely beautiful! Highly recommend supporting this amazing small business.
"Yohana‚Äôs shop is the best. She has gained a loyal customer in me because of her beautiful designs, product quality, and incomparable service. I looooove these daisy earrings and they are perfect for cute spring/summer looks! Lightweight and a great size, too. So much thought and detail is put into everything, even down to the packaging. It was such a delight to open my much anticipated 3 pairs of earrings order!"

The earrings are as pictured and exactly what I was looking for. I think this is also the quickest overseas shipping I've ever had. Thank you!
These are super cute - love them
My daughter has had 3 horrible experiences with getting her ears pierced. She absolutely cannot wear any type of pierced earring and her ear lobes are vey scared. She is absolutely thrilled with these earrings. They don‚Äôt look like ‚Äòfake‚Äô pierced or clip on earrings and the metal doesn‚Äôt irritate her at all. They are very comfortable and very cute. We could not be happier. Before her Senior photos she lost one in a dressing room and cried. I immediately got on Etsy and ordered her another pair and another single earring to go with the one she saved. The owner of the shop immediately responded and got the earring to us very fast. We are huge fans and will continue to buy jewelry from this shop. Thank you so much!!!!
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
These earrings are absolutely adorable!!! I loved them and instantly put them in. I have not bought any earrings that climb your ear so I was nervous but they look great!!!
They look so beautiful! I love them. I'm so glad I got them! I'm in love üòç
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."
"The ear cuff is exactly as you see it in the picture: good quality, solid silver and polished, and it came in a lovely ring box. Absolutely love it. Thank you Lucy!"
"Absolutely stunning!! Gorgeous!! Wonderful! Elegant!! Superb!! Fast, efficient and very friendly service. Best on Etsy!"
Perfect ear cuff! Thank you!
"Lovely quality ring, easy enough to manipulate to fit your finger perfectly. Great communication, quickly delivery and well packaged. Thank you!"
"My customized climber arrived fast, in beautiful, sparkling condition, and I'm obsessed! The seller is super sweet and helpful. My new favorite jeweler! Thank you so much!"
"I love this climber earring. I thought it would be bigger, but it fits my ear perfectly. Next time I'll get one that goes all the way up my ear. This one goes about half way. I got the right side only- to wear during my wedding ceremony. It's very comfortable."
"Definite show stoppers! My ears a bit small for the top claps, but I will sort it out. Beautiful!"
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much!
So happy with these! Gorgeous earrings arrived quickly and with a sweet note for my mom's birthday. The perfect balance between dressy and casual.
These earrings are gorgeous!! And the whole experience was very positive!
"Very cute, simple earrings and well-made. Will be buying from this shop again."
Tr√®s joli bijou tr√®s fin je ne suis pas d√©√ßue ! Ces boucles d‚Äôoreille sont superbes pr√©sent√©es dans une jolie bo√Æte. Je suis tr√®s contente de mon achat.
"Super quality but it was not clear that it‚Äòs two different earrings... this disappointed me a little bit. The shop could upload a picture with a woman wearing both earrings at the same time, that would help the fururw customers. Besides this point, nice quality and beautiful earrings!"
These are so beautiful and delicate! They sit so nicely on my ear I forget I have them on. Love them
"Items arrived faster than anticipated. I was confused and did think that it was a pair of earrings being delivered instead of just a set, but luckily I ordered multiple different earrings from the seller, so I have a cute mismatched ordeal going on. Items are incredibly beautiful, and I will certainly order again from this seller."
"Thank you so much! These are amazing, and I have received many compliments when wearing them."

"Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy! I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently."
These earrings are absolutely adorable!!! I loved them and instantly put them in. I have not bought any earrings that climb your ear so I was nervous but they look great!!!
Just WoW !!! Amazing . And I‚Äôve NEVER gotten anything this fast ! Customer Service was like dealing with my own family ! I‚Äôve been a fan of Harry Mason & these won‚Äôt be my lasts ones !! Thank you !!! I‚Äôm sure Harry is very pleased with the job you are doing ! God Bless !
Absolutely more stunning than the photo. Super comfortable and makes my ears look like a piece of art. The shipping was super fast. Sorry to hear about Harry Mason's passing. I plan to pass these down to my daughter.
"Fantastically fun, feather-weight, flexible, flirty earrings! The niobium-rainbow, three-spiral earrings are a standout, especially when wearing a plain colored face mask! Great shopping experience! Shipping is quick and free! Thank you for presenting this irreplaceable collection of Harry Mason Designs on Etsy!"
I bought these as a gift for my Aunt. She found out recently that HM earrings were available on ETSY and she was so excited. We were discussing her favorites and this pair was one of them. I ordered them during our phone call and they were shipped the next morning. She was so happy and surprised.

Awesome charms and I like the twist in these. I have ordered several sets from Coralie and loved all of them. The mail is so slow right now though. These were shipped on 4/3 and I just got them today. Well worth the wait.

Wow I finally got my earring jackets! Worth the wait! Ty!
Love these! Not gaudy and adds interest to studs. Light and move beautifully
"I purchased 2 ear cuffs in different sizes & patterns. They arrived within approx 3 weeks (expectations were set by the seller). I can honestly say these are the most comfortable ear cuffs I‚Äôve ever worn. Easy to put on, adjust & stay in place all day. I‚Äôm not even aware it‚Äôs there! And on top of that they are beautiful too. I‚Äôve had some lovely compliments about them & a friend has just ordered one for herself üòä Excellent!"

"Wow! This 14k Solid Gold Spider stud is gorgeous! It's so beautifully made, the detailing is intricate and polished to a high gloss. Also, it's wonderfully boxed - A great gift."
"Charming looking bracelet! Simple, discreet and cute - just the way I like it. It looks exactly like in the photo and I received it wrapped neatly in what appears to be a handmade fabric pocket-envelope, on the estimated delivery date. Excellent service and attention to detail. Very satisfied with my bracelet!"
"This such a great piece and so beautifully crafted. The whole transaction was so pleasant and the communication with Burcu was excellent. Even the wrap was of such a quality I could just gift it with out needing to redo, (it looked far superior to any wrap I could achieve!). Oozes pride and consideration by the creator and swiftly shipped."
i LOVE this dainty little pendant!! :) It compliments the ring you made for me wonderfully! Thank you so much! Your jewellery is always beautiful!! many compliments received for both!!!! :)))

I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I wore these for my wedding and they were absolutely stunning. Packaging and quality of the earrings was perfect. And they were very comfortable!
This bracelet is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! The quality is far more superb than the picture. It glistens and sparkles constantly it's not dull at all. It fits my wrist and I was worried that it wouldn't because I have a fat wrist. It's not flimsy and it feels very sturdy like it won't break. All that I can say is thank you so much for this beautiful piece of jewelry. I definitely will be shopping again!

"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop ü•∞, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again üòÅ"
Just arrived 3 minutes ago. Wow! Just beautiful! Many thanks. Constance
Beautiful. My second piece of jewelry from here ‚ù§Ô∏è
Magnifique... un rendu au top. Ce bijou va vite devenir une pi√®ce phare de ma collection ! ‚ú®
"I am more than pleased with these gorgeous earrings and I knew they were perfect for me as soon as I opened the package. They came from London and because of covid-19 it took a while to get here, almost 4 wks which was noted in the description, but they were definitely worth the wait. Miss Audrey was also quick to respond when I contacted her and I am certain to become a repeat customer...love love love the earrings!"
"My favourite design. I like such minimalism and at the same time noticeable jewellery. The most interesting thing is that I can wear those earrings in two ways: as a stud or with a second larger bauble. Awesome seller, nice packaging and amazing items!"
Super cute and super light weight earrings that came in a cute purple pouch! I have very small ear lobes and the piercing was done low but these are still very flattering.
Completely love these earrings. They are exactly as advertised and are gorgeous! Thank you Miss Audrey for your beautiful jewelry!
So beautiful!!!! These are my first pair of climbers and will not be my last. They came in 4 days and I could not be happier!
"Absolutely stunning! Wore these for my wedding, they were very comfortable, unique and beautiful."
Absolutely love this piece of jewelry! Very different and intricate: definitely my taste. This is probably my favorite piece of jewelry that I own!
"I got the silver ear crawler and I love it so much, it looks beautiful and it fits just right! Five stars for sure!"
I love my new earrings! The size is perfect and they are not heavy at all. Pure silver! No problems with the delivery. I am extremely happy with this purchase :)

Gorgeous! Wore these earrings to my bridal shower and bachelorette party.
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
"The earrings are exactly as pictured except more sparkle! I initially ordered in gold but needed to exchange for silver to better match my dress and the seller was extremely kind and helpful with the process. For me, these earrings are a little edgy/modern while still classic making them really versatile. I absolutely love my earrings, thank you Dana!!"
"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!"
"This is my favorite thing I‚Äôve purchased from Etsy like EVER! Nicely packaged, makes you excited to open it. So many nice touches to the packaging. The earrings are well made and easier to put in than I thought and more comfortable than I thought they‚Äôd be. I will never take these off! ALSO amidst all of the coronavirus stuff, they came in a reasonable time frame!"
"Absolutely love these and get so many compliments about them! They are beautiful and really good quality. Came in the most gorgeous envelope, in a little pouch and with a handwritten note. Incredible! Thank you so much!"
I paid for gift wrap and I was so impressed! My mum loves them and the wrapping. Especially how eco friendly it was! I had to stop her from opening them a day early. Thank you so much. Also your handwriting is beautiful!
I really love it! For my tiny ears it probably would be better if both arrows were a little bit smaller. The dimensions between lobe holes is perfect but they are a little long for my small ear. But that just means I may need to order more in a custom size üòâ truly love them!
So happy with these! Gorgeous earrings arrived quickly and with a sweet note for my mom's birthday. The perfect balance between dressy and casual.
These earrings are gorgeous!! And the whole experience was very positive!
"Very cute, simple earrings and well-made. Will be buying from this shop again."
These are my favourite so far. So classy!!
"Beautiful earrings, I love the flecks of gold!"
Merci beaucoup beau petit mod√®le
"Parfait, super belles."
I love everything about this bracelet. It is a perfect piece for Fall. Valerie's ceramic floral beads are gorgeous and special. The bracelet is adjustable and very stylish. High end creation.
"Valerie has created a lovely and sacred pair of earrings. I love the design, and the originality of the beads and elements. I have paired with an amber-themed necklace that truly compliments these special jewels. 5* quality."
Each and every one of these ceramic flowers is gorgeous. Valerie took great care with the details and colors. I decided to plant each piece right on the surface of the potting soil in each of my equally unusual flower pots. The look is lovely and unique. My small patio garden is an even happier place.
"G√©nial ! J adore et en plus une jolie surprise : une bague coordonn√©es ! Merci beaucoup. Le petit mot, Tr√®s rapide, en plus emballage nickel. Je vous recommande"
Absolutely love my bracelet!! Couldn‚Äôt be more in love with it! FTM here and this bracelet means the world to me.
Absolutely fabulous! I ordered this and personalised it and it was sent the next day. So beautiful and a perfect present for my friend. The two discs are a really good size - I love the fact that the second disc and personalisation is secret. Would really recommend.
"Simple, dainty bracelet! Looks just like the photos and have now purchased as gifts twice :)"
"Really sweet bracelet. Good quality, slight blemish but you can‚Äôt really see it, the quality is great and the engraving looks subtle and classic"
Very professional! The seller privately messaged me about my earrings and shipped them very fast. I had text messages too with updates from the postal service. The earrings themselves are beautiful. Excited to wear them...the case they came in was really nice and professional looking. Their jewelry would make great gifts! Thanks and happy holidaze‚úåÔ∏èüòé
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
These ear crawlers are so beautiful and really comfortable! I like them so much I ordered more pairs in different colors! Communication was great and shipping was fast. They also were packaged nicely. I can't say enough good things!
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."
"Lovely earrings- great quality, very pretty."
"Super qualit√©, envois rapide et cr√©oles aussi beaux que sur les photos."
"i love the earrings ! only remark i would have is that the hinge does become a bit loose with time, but nothing bad. thank you !"
"Beautiful earrings. Packaging was a lovely touch. Very pleased, thank you."
"This package was sent from the UK to Texas during the holidays. SO shipping was slow, but the package was worth the wait. The earrings are as perfect as in the photo and more. The backing is that jelly-stud backing (sorry, I don't know what to call it). It is the kind that will grip the stem tight so my earrings will never fall off and get lost. Which is greta, because they are fantastic! I seldom wear a pair, preferring mismatched a-symmetrical ""sets"", but these are great as a pair. The seller included a gift pair as well, (the only surprise gift I got for the holidays, though being a mom it is pretty normal). SO extra thanks for that!"
I am in love...
"These earrings are SO awesome! They add that extra ""something"" to my normal look, and I received compliments on them the first time I wore them! They are definitely some of my new favorites."
Thank you very much for the beautiful earnings and for the lovely extra pair you included as a gift. So lovely. I'm delighted with them.
These are so pretty and really nice quality! Love them üòç
i love this bag - the design looks even better in real life (quality's great too) and the sweets & print that came with it was such a nice touch.
Absolutely gorgeous earrings!! The seller was lovely and i will definitely be buying from here again!
So lovely!!! Thank you so much!!
"It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that‚Äôs to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!"
This is absolutely stunning. It took a little longer than I expected but the seller was quick to respond and reassure me. I absolutely love it. I will never go back to a traditional earring ever again!
These are amazing!! Haha So pretty!!<3 I got them for my sister for Christmas and she's going to love them!! Great service!! <3 :)
"c'est tr√®s joli, et belle finition :)"
"I adore this scrunchie! Fast shipment, a little bonus was the packaging and cute personalised postcard. You really get a beautiful piece of the Hermes scarf, love wearing it."
J‚Äôadore ce chouchou! Merci pour la petite carte aussi üíì

"These are absolutely beautiful! They're my every day earrings now. I sleep in them, shower in them, and they're very comfortable. Thank you for a beautiful product."
Fast shipping and the earrings are amazing! Such a good idea to make the jackets adjustable. Thank you Esther!
"These earrings are so cool! I've gotten many compliments on them. They are a little tricky to get on, though. I think it's the nature of this style."
Absolutely gorgeous.
"Beautiful unique earrings (I bought the feather ones) and a quality product. Arrived as per shipping timeline, beautifully wrapped as well. Natalia was very responsive to any questions I had. Highly recommend the product and seller"
"This is the first pair of ear jacket earrings I have owned, and I love them! They look so great on - and this pair especially. I have them in brass and the finish looks great. I have already gotten compliments on them. Thank you!"
These are absolutely beautiful!! Everything I hoped they would be! Thank you!!
"Even more beautiful in person. I have small ears and was concerned about the fit, but it turns out they fit perfectly. They are light and comfortable to boot!"
I meet the artist at a fair and bought one piece. Since then I‚Äôve bought several more and have received complements every day. I am giving her name to everyone interested.
"Beautiful jewellery, great quality and shipped really quickl. The colours in the picture were almost exactly as they were in real life and matched my wedding dress and colour theme perfectly! Would definitely buy from here again and recommend to friends and family :-)"
Absolutely beautiful! I am so glad I have found the perfect earrings.
Beautiful earring set! High quality. Seller was very helpful and worked with me when I had an issue. Can't wait to wear them out!
These are absolutely stunning!
"First of all, i can‚Äôt believe it got from France to NY in less than 2 weeks. Second, it‚Äôs SO MUCH PRETTIER IN PERSON. And it fits perfectly. Thank you so much Elizabeth !!!!!!!"
"I have bought several pieces of jewelry from this seller and they are all absolutely stunning, even more so in person! The seller keeps in communication and she‚Äôs so polite and kind. I couldn‚Äôt recommend a seller or her jewelry enough! I can‚Äôt stop looking at my beautiful pieces! Thank you so much!"
"These are so very beautiful in real life üòç Lovely bracelets, beautiful style and so well made! I purchased 4 altogether and one was a bespoke request to add olivine to the orange and yellow one at no extra charge. Its perfect ‚ù§ I would have no hesitating in recommending this seller. Thank you ü§©"
"Si j'avais pu mettre 10 √©toiles je l'aurais fait tant je suis fan de ce que fait Elizabeth !!. Visitez la boutique d'√âlizabeth, c'est un r√©gal pour les yeux. Elizabeth est tr√®s gentille et bichonne ses clients"
The earrings are beautiful! I love them soooo much!
"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"

"Item is exactly as pictured and comes with care instructions. Seller is very friendly, and prompt! I love that each ear cuff of the pair I got came with its own storage bag :) it helps so I don't confuse which is left vs. right 10/10 would recommend!"
"I can't say enough about how well this fits. I arranged with the seller to adjust it to fit my helix. She was very easy to work with and the cuffs fit beautifully! When my next order arrives, I will have 4 of them!"
"These are gorgeous! I bought a set of two, and they look fantastic alone or together, and especially with the silver ball earrings I already own and planned ot pair them with. I'm beyond pleased with this purchase, they are so pretty!"
Smooth surface and rounded edges. And I love that the legnth is just 7mm! I‚Äòm going to wear it in my 4th lobe and most other double flare plugs are way too long for that.
Slightly tarnished silver but they look beautiful and are just the right size! Would definitely buy from again!
My boyfriend is obsessed with these I bought him as a birthday present. Exactly like the photos (if not even better in real life). Will 100% be buying more stuff from this seller - their shipping time couldn‚Äôt be faulted. A++++++
"Lovely item & amazing customer service from Tribu. I accidentally ordered 2 pairs (problems with the Etsy site, not the Tribu shop) without noticing what I'd done. Within a couple of hours of placing the order, Annika from Tribu had messaged me to double check if I'd meant to order 2 identical pairs. When I explained that I only wanted 1 pair, she immediately refunded the money. I recieved my earrings within a couple of days. Great quality and beautifully packaged. Cannot recommend Tribu highly enough!"
They are so cute!! They are smaller than I expected but I love themü•∞
Ces boucles d'oreilles √©taient un cadeau qui a ravi la personne √† laquelle je les ai offertes !
Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et originales.
Commande re√ßue dans les d√©lais. Tr√®s contente de mon achat. Fait avec beaucoup de minutie.
"For the second year in a row, I purchased earrings from OSingulierBoutique, the pieces inspired by the tiny Greek islands of Amorgos (last year's purchase) and Koufonissia , (this year's purchase) - both places which we visit on our trips back 'Home' to Greece. The pieces are made well, durable, look beautiful, and best of all: They truly do remind us of our favorite places. The deep turquoise blue and gold in the Amorgos piece clearly take inspiration of the island, it's so obvious I can envision it. The same for the bright blue/greens of the Koufonissia piece! the color of the Aegean Sea hitting the beach, and the bright white golden color of the sand are spot on. If a Patmos inspired piece is made, we'll take it!"
BO Magnfiques encore plus jolies en vrai que sur la photo. Je les ai offertes et elles ont fait un tabac. Envoi rapide et soign√©. Communication tr√®s facile avec la vendeuse.
"J ai re√ßu mes boucles d oreilles tr√®s rapidement. Sur photo, elles √©taient tr√®s jolies, en r√©alit√©, elles le sont davantage. Tr√®s l√©g√®res, color√©es, tr√®s bien emballees et avec go√ªt! J adore!! Merci"
"Bijoux cr√©atifs de toutes sortes, de toutes formes, mati√®res eclectiques. Tr√®s agr√©ables √† porter, finit magnifiquement une tenue. De plus j'adore la fermeture de celles-ci. On en redemande toujours plus, jamais rassasi√© car beaucoup de renouvellement. Vite allez y !!!!"
"These are the most beautiful dainty little ear climbers I've come across! They stay in place, are light weight and very comfortable! Not to mention beautiful craftsmanship! I am currently wearing these beautiful ones since this afternoon when I received them!Already have a couple pairs waiting for me in my cart now ü•∞‚ù§"
These are GORGEOUS. I love them - and Tiffany offered such incredible customer service. She answered all my questions immediately and made sure I was getting exactly what I was looking for - then made and shipped them immediately. yay!
"These are BEAUTIFUL!! Sweet and dainty, and the artist took extra care to make sure the flashy bits were all on the same side. Really appreciated the instruction as I don't have any other pair of earrings like this. Super comfy as well. Hoping to buy again when my budget allows, thanks so much <3"
"I love these earrings! They are so pretty and have a handmade look and feel about them, beautifully crafted. I'm obsessed I've been wearing them everyday! They stay in place really well even though they only just fit on my tiny ears. The only time they fall out of place is it I knock them or my hair gets caught in them. They're amazing and were beautifully packaged too."
"Love this! It is such a versatile chain, you can hook it to just one earring or in between two. The quality is amazing! Very well- made and sturdy. Definitely gives an edge to your earrings. Perfect layering piece."
Love my new chain. I wanted it for my conch but it was too short. It still looks super cute in my earlobe.
Very pretty! I love these earring jacket dangles. So versatile!
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"ü§©Je suis ravie de mon achat. Exactement ce que je cherchais : raffin√©es, cr√©atives et color√©es! L'emballage est tr√®s √©l√©gant! Vivement mon prochain achat!"
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles!! J'adore le style! Travail avec finitions tr√®s soign√©es. Envoi ultra rapide. Je commanderai s√ªrement d'autres articles. Merci beaucoup.
"superbes boucles d'oreilles, tr√®s originales. Du beau travail de tissage de perles. Envoi hyper rapide avec un joli petit paquet et un cadeau sans date butoir, merci c'est top"
"Magnifiques boucles d'oreilles, tr√®s bien r√©alis√©es et envoi rapide. Je recommande cette boutique!!"
"The snake cuff has easily become my favourite statement piece, personally I don't wear the earrings, they're not really my style, but they're nice semi-hooped and not too big. The cuff is main to sit on your left ear facing up, but of course can sit on your right ear facing down, which depending on your ear shape can look even better, so it's fun to experiment with its placement! It is adjustable to some extent, personally with small ears I found I didn't dare squeeze it past a certain point in case it snaps, leading to a more ""pinching"" than ""hugging"" effect that after a few hours of wearing of course starts to hurt, but the pros overall outway the cons since it's such a beautiful piece!"
"I was pleasantly surprised when my purchase arrived. The earrings and the ring are more beautiful than I imagined. Fine quality and packaging. I hope to see more new items to match. Either way, I will be returning. Thank you!"
I love the set ! It‚Äôs so cute ! Been wearing it A LOT !!
"Really happy with these earrings, they are even prettier then the pictures. Great price too! I will definitely be using this business again."
"I saw this clicker and fell in love with its lace-like edge, and layered look. I contacted magic hammer for a custom no-stone look and David was prompt and okay with that. It‚Äôs in 18k rose gold~ I thought I needed a 9mm, but then I needed a resize, which was accommodated for a restock fee. I love staring at it in my hand, the workmanship! Tiny, clean detail~ plus! Without the stone in the center, if the clicker moves off-center it‚Äôs not obvious it‚Äôs off-center ;3"
"I‚Äôm totally obsessed with this shop‚Äî absolutely gorgeous array of septum jewelry! I love this piece; quality is excellent and it fits my piercing perfectly. I have a deviated septum and so jewelry hangs low, but this petite ring has a very small diameter. I want to start saving for another!!!"
"Receiving my jewelry brought a huge smile to my face. This was a custom project, and David was attentive and professional in communicating about the details. I asked him to combine the skull centerpiece of one daith piece with the band from the princess diamond jewelry. The band is white gold, with black diamonds on the band, consistent with the options for the original. The skull has citrine for eyes in lieu of the original black diamonds. Apologies for the low quality picture--it doesn't do the work justice. I will certainly recommend Magic Hammer to others and will be a returning customer."
"Really beautiful. The snap closure is super secure but easy to snap closed, even in a daith piercing where there isn't much room for your fingers. The polish is excellent and the flat face really picks up the light. I bought the 16 ga/10 mm ring, which replaced a basic segment clicker with the same dimensions. It's heavier than the titanium ring I had in it previously, so it moves forward and back. Not uncomfortable, but I wouldn't recommend putting something this heavy in a daith piercing that hasn't fully healed."
"J'ai command√© 3 masques bretons, bonne qualit√© et livraison rapide, c'est super ! Je me suis m√™me fait interpeller dans la rue pour savoir o√π je les avais achet√©s :-) Rapport qualit√©/prix parfait, je recommande."

"I love these little earrings! Every time I go out with them on (usually to have a cheeseburger), I get comments from others about them and how absolutely adorable they are! PurpleCat also customized them to include pickles! I'm thinking pizza earrings are next!"
Absolutely what I was looking for! The stencil is sturdy but thin enough for me to put it into my journal pocket. The numbers are fantastic! Thank you so much!
These earrings are beautiful in their simplicity. They are the perfect size to wear for any occasion although I find I wear them almost daily! The delivery of them was very prompt.
"Gorgeous little earrings and arrived with a lovely note from Yaelle, they're really pretty and were posted fast, she even messaged me to let me know they were on their way. Thank you!"
"I love this piece! It‚Äôs so cute! I will say that if you like leaving your jewelry in for long periods of time, you will need to like just go over the jewelry with like a cotton swab and something to clean it with. Gets kinda dirty fast for some reason! Will buy from this seller again. Lol I‚Äôm like super faded in the pic but it shows the jewelry so whatever lol"
"Shipping was incredibly fast. Ear crawler is very unique, just as pictured and and I am satisfied with this overall purchase. Thank you"
"I love the nose ring so much I ordered 4! Lol, for my double nostril and double helix."
I love this nose ring so much. Get many compliments and it‚Äôs just so cool looking. Will probably be ordering more!
I bought the beautiful ring from Nikki first and was so happy that I asked her to make me the bangle to match for my daughters 21st. I am delighted both with the result and the service offered. I gave Nikki a tight time frame and she hand delivered to make sure the bangle arrived in time for the party. Thanks again Nikki....love it!
"I love these earrings, so delicate and pretty. I‚Äôm excited to wear them out. I‚Äôd definitely recommend buying from Nikki. Only problem is choosing the piece they‚Äôre all so lovely."
Finally got them Nikki & I luv them. They are so light. Well done Cheers Kate
"We received the ring and are pleased with the quality, unfortunately we did not get it in time even though we paid for rush shipping. Ultimately, we should have ordered it sooner. A little disappointed with shipping, but we are happy with the ring nonetheless. Thank you!"
"Magnifique collier, de la bonne taille. Livraison rapide, je conseille vivement cette boutique, merci beaucoup."
"Magnifique collier, de la bonne taille. Livraison rapide, je conseille vivement cette boutique, merci beaucoup."
"I loved this the moment that I saw it on instagram. At first I didn't come to the shop to look because I assumed that it would be very expensive. It was not! It is beautiful, well made, unique, just perfect! I love it even more now, it'smine! I recommend urban raven to anyone looking for a unique piece of wearable art. You won't be disappointed!"
"I received my order suuuper fast. This necklace is extremely cute & unique, really fits my style :) Love it!"
I can't say enough about this necklace! This necklace is everything and more! Fits perfectly and goes with everything I wear! I was shocked how quickly the item arrived considering it was international! The fact that it's one of a kind and was upcycled is so beautiful! I am also so partial to butterflies as my oldest daughter's name -- Vanessa actually means butterfly so it has an extra special meaning to me! Thank you so much for your quality work and excellent customer service! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"I wear this ring all the time! Well, that along with the other ring I purchased from her. Such a unique item and made with perfection."

Beautiful craftsmanship and they fit perfectly
"I ordered the sterling silver earrings and they are so beautiful and shiny! They are very comfortable to wear and I love how the earrings are a classy looking statement piece. Shipping was very fast also, I received the earrings much faster than expected."
"These earrings are lovely! Exactly what I expected. They are a little too long for my ears, but they still fit and are the size I ordered. I've been wearing ear-climber earrings for a while and wanted to try a different style. :) They do look lovely, though! Also, the shop owner was very good with communicating when I asked a simple question about my shipment. Five stars!"
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
"Shipped faster than expected. And it‚Äôs the perfect size! I haven‚Äôt taken it out since I got it. Seriously, my favorite for my rook."
"BO ""bon oeil"" Les anneaux suppl√©mentaires ajout√©s leur conf√®rent un air encore plus boh√©mien... Que les pr√©dictions soient fiables ! Les astres n'ont plus qu'√† bien se tenir. Lol. Merci Muriel, elles sont super."
Elles sont superbes! √âl√©gantes et l√©g√®res. L‚Äôassociation des couleurs est bien pens√©e. Muriel a beaucoup de go√ªt pour associer les couleurs et les formes. Je guette les nouveaut√©s !
I am in love with every set of Frida earrings I've purchased and these are no exception! So beautiful and so well made! Cannot rate highly enough! Delighted as always. Thank you ‚ù§

"Lovely unusual earrings! Minimal and strange, beautifully made, packed with care. I've already slept with them in (comfy) and they don't tangle in my hair."

Orit has the best shop!! So nice and great customer service. The earrings are high quality and do not irritate my ears like others. I will continue to be a customer :)
Omg this is the most beautiful necklace. Its so dainty but is instantly recognised. Ive had so many comments. I normally only wear gold but this looks so amazing i havent taken it off.
Absolutely STUNNING comfortable subtle and so feminine the glow!

Exactly what I was looking! Simple and cute for everyday.
Happy to have simple but interesting earrings! Arrived sooner than expected.
Beautiful earrings and friendly service.
I love this piece of jewelry it‚Äôs unique and gets a lot of attentionüôÇ the first couple times I wore it I realize that I have to keep an eye on it when dawning my Covid mask. I found when I took my mask from around my ear I saw the earring on the ground so I hv to remain conscious that its there - its so light weighted! I just got to be careful n touch my ear now n then to make sure it‚Äôs still there! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too big I did get the large I think the small might be too small but I think I would have the same issue but I love it! thank you. Customer support was great because I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to get the large or the small and I measured my ear as instructed and was advised on the large. A Beautiful piece of jewelryüôÇ
"Oof, I love this earring. I had it in my wishlist for so long and I am very happy that I finally got it. Things to know, the metal is extremely thin and easily bendable. To me, this is a good thing. What I didn't notice from the pictures is that the lobe portion pushes your lobe forward a bit and can look a little unflattering, but it is easy to ever so slightly bend the metal where it needs to go. I also have extremely hard cartilage that gets irritated easily so I was able to make the curve in the top a little wider to accommodate my ear. Last thing to know if it is not wide earphone friendly. The earring will hit the pause button on my raycons, haha! Again, not much of an issue, I just adjust it and I'm good. I've worn them all day (paired with the threader long threader earring to make that asymmetrical look)."
"This is my second pair of these rose gold earring jackets. I love them so much, I wanted a backup pair in case I lose one. The color is absolutely beautiful. They are a sleek, elegant design, and very high quality craftsmanship. Perfect for a variety of styles and purposes. Packaging is lovely, and shipping was really fast from UK. A wonderful purchase!!"
These earrings are simply beautiful and have such a unique look. I am absolutely in love with them and I am wearing them almost everyday! Thank you very much Marcia!
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!!!"
An absolute pleasure purchasing from Marcia‚Äôs beautiful shop! I searched for the perfect jewellery for such a long time and then found Marcia! Her necklace and earrings were the gorgeous finishing touches on my Wedding day! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Absolutely delighted with this gorgeous ring, it‚Äôs so delicate and exactly what we‚Äôd hoped for. We bought it along with the green sapphire engagement ring, and they stack together beautifully. Marcia was so helpful, and they arrived together slightly earlier than was estimated, which we really appreciated. It‚Äôs so lovely, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to even wait to be married to start wearing it ;) x"
These earrings are stunning. The pictures do not to them justice! I‚Äôm so excited to wear these for my wedding - they‚Äôll give me that extra little edge on my big day!
Perfect! I can't wait to wear them
I am just in love. These have been on my favourites list for well over a year and I do ally bought them for my upcoming wedding! I wish I‚Äôd bought them sooner. They are absolutely stunning. Definitely an eye catching accessory and just like the picture. They arrived really quickly too! 5 stars all round!

I recieved this beautiful cowrie shell earring cuff. The photo doesn't do it justice. Some much so I purchased to more today. I love seeking unique jewelry. I highly recommend seller. It's worth the wait. Delivery is very satisfactory. Love my purchase.
They are dainty and perfect! I love these!
These earrings are wonderful! Thank you. Only thing I wish my earlobes could be larger or the bridge between ear jacket shorter. Material is fine and the work is done perfect!
I have been looking for the perfect pair of silver hoops and these filled that order! I have them on right now and I know I will enjoy them for a long time. Excellent craftsmanship and a fair price.
"I ordered these for my wedding and they‚Äôre great! I have smaller ears so the longer style I‚Äôve seen wasn‚Äôt going to work. They‚Äôre a little tricky to get in at first, but once they‚Äôre in they look so cute!"
Purchased to wear this to my Yosemite wedding in California. I absolutely LOVE them. They are delicate and cute.
The gold is a little more yellow than I expected but- they came super fast and they are really beautiful!

Love this earring! It was the perfect staple jewelry that I wore to a wedding! Received so many compliments and it stayed in during a night full of dancing
These ear climbers are beauties! Rose gold is my new color and I am lovin these!
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."

"Beautiful earrings! Excellent craftsmanship. I purchased as a pair to wear as a set. My only minor complaint is that the gauge of the wire/post was thicker than my ears are typically used to. It was a bit of a struggle to get them in, and it hurt a little bit as my holes were stretched. I‚Äôve worn them every day for almost a week now, and the pain was minimal and only lasted a day or two. Shipping was incredibly fast."
"L‚Äôorecchino e‚Äô esattamente come immaginavo , soddisfazione 100%"
"These huggie earrings are so pretty! I scrupulously took measurements before I purchased them, but I was still taken aback at just how tiny they are! They are teeny tiny, but delightfully sparkly + perfect! Super fast processing and shipping (purchased Friday; delivered Monday‚Äì‚Äìhalf-way across the US). Very pleased with this purchase. Thank you!! ** top right photo is the huggie in second piercing next to a 3mm stud."
"Wonderful experience! I ordered on the 22 and received the earrings on the 24th! Super fast shipping! Beautiful earrings. I bought a pair. I‚Äôve had these in my cart for a while and finally purchased them. So glad I did. Super sparkly, unique and great quality. Thanks so much! :)"
these are a showstopper! I love them!
The cuffs are absolutely stunning! Very well maid with lots of details.
I received the earrings and they are beautiful.
I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
"Beautiful jewellery, great quality and shipped really quickl. The colours in the picture were almost exactly as they were in real life and matched my wedding dress and colour theme perfectly! Would definitely buy from here again and recommend to friends and family :-)"
Absolutely beautiful! I am so glad I have found the perfect earrings.
Beautiful earring set! High quality. Seller was very helpful and worked with me when I had an issue. Can't wait to wear them out!
These are absolutely stunning!
These are my favourite so far. So classy!!
Merci beaucoup beau petit mod√®le
Parfait! Je la porte presque tous les jours.
Even more beautiful in person. Thank you!

Awesome charms and I like the twist in these. I have ordered several sets from Coralie and loved all of them. The mail is so slow right now though. These were shipped on 4/3 and I just got them today. Well worth the wait.

Le jour de son arriv√©e je les ai adopt√©es! Couleur or transparente! Crochet doux √† enfiler!
"First of all, i can‚Äôt believe it got from France to NY in less than 2 weeks. Second, it‚Äôs SO MUCH PRETTIER IN PERSON. And it fits perfectly. Thank you so much Elizabeth !!!!!!!"
"I have bought several pieces of jewelry from this seller and they are all absolutely stunning, even more so in person! The seller keeps in communication and she‚Äôs so polite and kind. I couldn‚Äôt recommend a seller or her jewelry enough! I can‚Äôt stop looking at my beautiful pieces! Thank you so much!"
"Si j'avais pu mettre 10 √©toiles je l'aurais fait tant je suis fan de ce que fait Elizabeth !!. Visitez la boutique d'√âlizabeth, c'est un r√©gal pour les yeux. Elizabeth est tr√®s gentille et bichonne ses clients"
"OH MY GOODNESS! I am obsessed with these so much! I am definitely buying more! Great shipping, so affordable and such a unique tap to any outfit üòç‚ú®"
I love everything I bought!! The unicorn earrings are so cute! I'm definitely ordering more stuff.
"Absolutely love this and have worn it multiple times (I got one and I wear a stud in the opposite ear, but would look good as a pair). Very unique. Came in a little clear box which I use to store it."
GORGEOUS!!!
Lovely earrings. I am amending my review because of how beautiful the earrings are! Just disappointing they took 20 days to come and had no response to my query‚Äôs if they had actually been dispatched
The pieces don't fit together so the earrings are not wearable.
"I like it well enough, though I didn't receive the exact item pictured. I got a pair that had a clear gemstone on the one star. There was a bonus pair of climbers, though, so that was a nice surprise"
"The design of the ring was absolutely beautiful. The metal of the adjustable band was a little softer than I anticipated, but it makes sense since it's meant to be adjustable. Due to how soft the metal is, I would say this feels more like occasional/costume jewelry rather than an everyday ring, but I am still satisfied with this purchase and working with this seller."
"I searched around for weeks to find the perfect earrings to wear on my wedding day and when I stumbled on these I fell in love! A fun spin on hoops, but very classic with the pearls. I love how dainty they are but very sturdy. I know they will last. I also have sensitive ears and usually get red, hot when I try out new jewelry, but I could not even feel these once I put them on! I could not recommend these enough!!!"
"The pearls look much better in person! The size is perfect, just as seen in the photo. I LOVE that this is gold filled. I only wish this seller would make more gold filled jewelry. I‚Äôm obsessed with the fancy decorated box these come in too. 5 stars for packaging, earrings, & this seller overall! I‚Äôve bought several & will definitely buy more in the future."
These earrings are a perfect complement to a charm bracelet my husband gave me. I found them after much searching and I just love them. They are so light and delicate but have so much style. And the packaging is so pretty and unique that I cut out the top of the box and placed it at the bottom of a favorite card hanging in my study. A very talented artisan here!
"Oh my gosh! I LOVE these earrings! I Purchased a pair for my niece, and then Decided to get a pair for myself. I‚Äôm so glad I did! They are so unique and pretty. Nana was lovely to work with. Very quick shipping and quick responses to my inquiries. I highly recommend the shop!"
Love these! I have sensitive ears and these do not bother them at all! And they look great!
"I was so happy to receive my ring! First of all, the packaging was beautiful! I couldn‚Äôt wait to open it and see my ring with the paw print of my beloved girl that I recently lost. I had a few questions before I ordered, and Molly was very prompt to answer my questions. The round part with the paw print was slightly larger than I had expected, but I still love it. And I wish half sizes had been offered, because I have small hands, but no big deal. I just ordered the smallest size offered. Overall, this is a very special piece of jewelry that I will cherish and I am extremely pleased with my order!! Thank you, Molly!! :)"
"The cutest packaging ever!!! I fell in love with the rose petals‚ù§Ô∏è I bought the birth year of my boyfriend & he loved it as well! I even received a thank you note so cute!! The necklace was so worth the higher price, I had to compare different necklaces & I work at a jewelry department so I can tell it‚Äôs good quality!! Shipping was free & I received it quick. Such a good purchase I love itü•∞"
This company is so amazing! They are so sweet and care so much about if you got your product and how you like it! My ring is so beautiful and the paw print is exact! It is so special to me and I‚Äôll now always have my dog with me. The packaging also was so adorable with dried flower pedals inside. Love it!

Good luck for the future and Merry Christmas"

So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
"This ear climber is truly brilliant; the sparkle is superlative! Quality is sturdy, and it stays in place for hours without leaving my ear feeling sore as other cartilage clips and magnets have done. Shipping was fast and the earrings were spotless and nicely packaged; I'm so looking forward to wearing this climber to several upcoming occasions! Thank you Iloniti!"
I had to switch these out for a different pair only because my ears are a bit smaller than average and it didn't sit right. Ilona to the rescue! She was so accommodating and allowed me to seamlessly exchange for a pair that perfectly compliment my headpiece and dress. Thank you soooo much!
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
"My ""something blue"" on my wedding day. The pieces were beautiful!"
This bracelet is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! The quality is far more superb than the picture. It glistens and sparkles constantly it's not dull at all. It fits my wrist and I was worried that it wouldn't because I have a fat wrist. It's not flimsy and it feels very sturdy like it won't break. All that I can say is thank you so much for this beautiful piece of jewelry. I definitely will be shopping again!

Omg! The most beautiful hoops. The details are out of this world. I cannot wait to wear and so glad I add them to my special jewelry collection ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love it! I was so excited to receive it. I‚Äôm glad there is someone who is representing our Mayan indigenous culture through beautiful meaningful jewelry. I showed it to my dad and he was so jealous. He wants a ring now. Hold this piece close to my heart as I have strong Yucatec Mayan roots. Thanks Andrea! ü§ç
If I‚Äôm not mistaken this is my 7th pair of earrings I‚Äôve bought from Andrea. Each time I‚Äôm amazed by her creativity and love seeing how each pair is different. These are no exception!! In love. Please don‚Äôt stop creating we need more of your art!!
I've always dreamed of wearing an Ixiq Design's pair of earrings for my wedding and these were the perfect pair to add drama to my future look. Thank you again for these gorgeous earrings!

"Just like the picture.. but the way it was pckaged, stunningly! Every little detail was taken from the box to the wrapping and the most elegant care has been taken! This was sent with love! üòò‚ù§Ô∏è"
"The original climbing earring was too long, returned without issues. Requested a shorter one and its stunning. Great design and art work. Thank you for your creativity"
Love it!
Seriously love these earrings!!! They are perfect!
I ordered the 1 inch earrings and I didn‚Äôt realize that my earlobes were too small for that length. Rachelle was quick to answer my message about the issue and offered me an exchange after figuring out they weren‚Äôt the correct size. I am very happy with the .75 length earrings! They are great quality and I received the exchange very quickly. I would definitely purchase again from her because she was super sweet and helpful!
"Straight up, this is the first earring to not cause pain in my helix piercing. I immediately noticed how comfortable it was! It's amazing! After 20 years I've pretty much given up on keeping anything in it for more than a day... But now I can! The packaging was so cute and as a fellow Etsy shop owner, I appreciated the handwritten note. (I do that, too!) All around, I am 100% thrilled and will be buying MORE! Thank you, thank you!! ‚ù§"
"Rachelle applied all the finishing touches to make me excited and pleased before I even opened the box! The hand crafted, Swarovski crystal, teardrop, dangle, titanium earrings are beautiful. If there might be a downside-it is that the titanium ear wiring is very thin on the dangles. I say ‚Äúmight‚Äù because I have not worn them enough to see how well they hold up to normal wear. Rachelle even included a lovely pair of hypoallergenic plastic post NO nickel post earrings as a thank you gift. I am SUPER pleased with the earrings I ordered and the excellent customer service! I cannot wait to order again. Thank you Rachelle. 4.8 üåü Penny"
These earrings are perfect! I have very sensitive ears and can't wear most earrings. These are comfortable and don't cause any redness or itching. They shipped fast too! I'll definitely be ordering more!

I wear these earrings EVERY day! They‚Äôre so so cute. ü•∞"
"These earrings are so pretty and simple. I also appreciate that they are true to their materials by being good for sensitive ears. I‚Äôve worn them twice now since getting them a month ago, and I think the last time I wore earrings before that was almost a year ago. I‚Äôm excited to buy more from this shop!"

These earrings are wonderful! Thank you. Only thing I wish my earlobes could be larger or the bridge between ear jacket shorter. Material is fine and the work is done perfect!
They are dainty and perfect! I love these!

I really like these earrings but they are a little difficult to get the backs on--very tiny. But I am wearing them today!
Echt sehr sehr h√ºbsch üòç!
"Beautiful set, but they were bent upon arrival and somewhat difficult to put in my ears, as each earring is three tiny pieces. They also bend very easily when they're being handled. Overall very pretty but somewhat disappointed by the quality."

I LOVE these!! I‚Äôm wearing them on my wedding day üòä
Item shipped fast. Looks exactly like the pictures. I ordered the smallest size chain and it‚Äôs the perfect size. Haven‚Äôt taken it off since I received it! It‚Äôs reasonably priced but doesn‚Äôt seem cheaply made at all.
"This is absolutely PERFECT! I love it so much! I was looking for a simple necklace, and this did the trick! I got the 16‚Äù. ¬∞O¬∞"
"The item came quickly and I loved it right away. It was a size too small so I messaged the seller, and they responded quickly and exchanged for the right size. The bracelet is beautiful - very delicate and comfortable to wear! I will definitely shop here again for jewelry in the future!"
Package took the amount of time that is described at checkout since it truly is coming from Greece. Very happy with earrings! They are exactly the fit i was looking for! Great product and material!
"Lovely! Bijoux fid√®les √† l'image, tr√®s mignons."
"Beautiful jewelry! Great quality and it shipped fast. Only issue is that on the shop page the seller claims that the items are shipping from the U.S., however, I was charged a foreign transaction fee. I even had my results filtered on the Etsy app to only show those shipping from the U.S. If I would have known this, I would have used a different credit card to avoid the fee. Just want others to be aware before ordering!"
"That is not true, we simply use an international payment provider. Your order like the others was shipped right out our studio in US. You're welcome to check it via the tracking number if you wish."
"The climbers are pretty, solid, nicely made. I bought the climbers to hide some of my old piercings."
Loved it!!! Fast shipping to EU
Just what I wanted. Love these!
"Quick delivery, fits description and the recipient loved them. The customized note was handwritten and the seller even corrected a typo I didn't see. Thank you!"
I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase."
"Great earrings! Very good service- arrived on time and exactly as promised. Actually, better in person! Thank you!"
Such beautiful earrings and came with the cutest note ever! Thank you so much!
Literally the cutest earrings I ever bought oml super fast shipping too. Will be buying from this store again
so cute and amazing quality
"Tr√®s agr√©able surprise üòä Le collier est magnifique, l‚Äôenvoi tres soign√© et hyper rapide. Je recommande les yeux ferm√©s ! Merci bcp"
"Love, love, love my Betty Boop earings! The length and size is perfect. I'm a big Betty Boop fan. The price is great."
"Je suis encore ravie de ma commande. Le colis a √©t√© envoy√© tr√®s rapidement. J'adore les boucles d'oreilles et le marque page. Ce n'est pas ma premi√®re commande, ni ma derni√®re."
superbes. ma petite fille √©tait enchant√©e. elle les porte avec le bracelet .. ensemble top !! .. envoi soign√© et rapide je recommande ce site et la boutique
"Holy cow I ADORE these earrings! Beautiful, understated, and came super fast. Pro tip you have to twist them in backwards (from the back of your piercing instead of the front) to get them to lay right--took me wayy to long to figure out but was super easy once I did!"
"I love these earrings! I wore them for prom and get soooo many compliments, they weren‚Äôt too heavy either!"
"These earrings are gorgeous! So much so, that the second I put them on, my partner told me that she was going to steal them."
I was super excited for these. I really love the look of black earrings and the designs were awesome. The paint on these earrings is coming off though so a little disappointed.
I can't say enough about this fabulous shop! Courtney was an absolute pleasure to work with and did an amazing job packing and shipping my purchase. My earrings arrived very quickly and were expertly packed using high quality materials. She even sent an unprompted note after shipment advising me on the best way to keep the earrings from pulling/drooping on my ears. I would shop here again in a heartbeat and have added MarhevCo to my favorites. I highly recommend Courtney and her shop for fine estate jewelry purchases. A+++ experience from start to finish!
These earrings are just what I wanted and they were shipped immediately! Thanks so much!
"I think it did a ""road tour"" of the US for over 3 weeks before finally leaving that country & arriving in mine, much to my delight. Eye-catching ! The camera does not do it justice- throws sparkles of colour whenever the light catches it- & we have sooo much light over here! Thank you."
I bought a vintage engagement ring that needed to be resized. Courtney was incredibly helpful and had the ring resized and to me in record time (even during a pandemic). I absolutely recommend this shop to anyone looking for unique vintage jewelry
"Les pierres n'ont pas une forme tr√®s r√©guli√®re et une des cha√Ænes tourne, mais sinon c'est un prix raisonnable pour une √©meraude...."

Necklace is very beautiful!!! Great quality! I got length 38 and it fits perfect! Love it!
Really beautiful earrings! It took a little time to get used to how these work but they really stay on well and really well made. So pretty.
So pretty--and the how-to instructions are a real bonus!
So beautiful and just like the photo. Can‚Äôt wait to wear these for my wedding.
These earrings are beautiful. The mixed metals allow you to pair them with any accessory. I love the active motion of the two pieces. Beautiful!
These earrings are beautiful and great quality! I had some questions about my order and Kamilah responded to me and answered my questions quickly!
"Loving these so far! A little nervous that the pieces are not glued together so hoping I can hold on to the whole earring but overall, really pleased :)"
I love these earrings! They are so unique and fun and go with everything.
"I absolutely love my earrings! They fit my ears perfectly, and the detail and craftsmanship is exquisite! The Earrings reflect the beauty and delicate nature of the fern. Thank you so much, I am a very happy customer!"
I love these earrings! Very comfortable to wear. They're so pretty and dainty. This shop is amazing! Will definitely be buying from them again.
"I loved these when I saw them. I wanted something different but not too flamboyant (cause that's not really my style). Once I got the hang of putting them on my ears, they stayed comfortably and I would forget I even had them on."
Absolutely love them! So cute!
Rapidement envoy√© et re√ßu. Tr√®s satisfait. Tr√®s belle pi√®ce. Je reviendrais s√ªrement
"Juste magnifiques, simples, l√©g√®res, f√©minines, j'adore!"
Elles sont magnifiques. Je ferrai une autre commande dans quelques jours. Merci beaucoup. zeze
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
"Shipped faster than expected. And it‚Äôs the perfect size! I haven‚Äôt taken it out since I got it. Seriously, my favorite for my rook."
"My customized climber arrived fast, in beautiful, sparkling condition, and I'm obsessed! The seller is super sweet and helpful. My new favorite jeweler! Thank you so much!"
"I love this climber earring. I thought it would be bigger, but it fits my ear perfectly. Next time I'll get one that goes all the way up my ear. This one goes about half way. I got the right side only- to wear during my wedding ceremony. It's very comfortable."
"Definite show stoppers! My ears a bit small for the top claps, but I will sort it out. Beautiful!"
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much!
Love these. They're very comfortable and lightweight. I've received lots of compliments. They arrived quickly and were nicely boxed. I'll be back for more! Thanks so much!
"Very good craftsmanship, feels solid and adapts perfectly on the ear due to adjustable length and the right shape of the jackets"
I love my rose gold climber earrings! They go with everything. Thank you so much!
Beautiful..just beautiful! We LOVE our rings! The communications was amazing! They Answered any questions we had about shipping and made sure we were going to have the rings in time for our wedding. :)
"These earrings are quite literally, out of this world (hence, usually I have poor timing :))) you can waer time any time of year, for literally and occasional. The first day I wore them, I received more then 20 compliments!!! Soooo, thank you kindly !!!!"
"My new ring is everything I hoped for and more! I had been looking for this exact style of Art Deco band for a long time that was actually quality, but finding something without stones/diamonds (which I preferred) proved to be very difficult. When I saw this ring, I was smitten. It is beautiful and delicate, but feels sturdy enough to last a very, very long time. It arrived a few days early even, and was packaged very professionally. I am very excited, thank you!! (Ordered Art Deco band in yellow gold.)"
"I love this piece! It‚Äôs so cute! I will say that if you like leaving your jewelry in for long periods of time, you will need to like just go over the jewelry with like a cotton swab and something to clean it with. Gets kinda dirty fast for some reason! Will buy from this seller again. Lol I‚Äôm like super faded in the pic but it shows the jewelry so whatever lol"
"Shipping was incredibly fast. Ear crawler is very unique, just as pictured and and I am satisfied with this overall purchase. Thank you"
"I love the nose ring so much I ordered 4! Lol, for my double nostril and double helix."
Absolutely in love!! It‚Äôs so hard to find gold jewelry that doesn‚Äôt tarnish but is still affordable
Thank you! Lovely earrings. Arrived pretty fast.
LOVE these earrings! And I was even gifted a cute letter ‚Äúe‚Äù ring complimentary with my order. Love the simple aesthetic and shipped surprisingly fast to the US!
Package arrived on time and the packaging was super cute! I love the earrings and they look great on! Would definitely buy more jewlry from this shop!
Absolutely beautiful earrings!! I love them! so unique! Thank you!!
I love my necklace from Katell. I am a Tahitian pearl lover and really like the design and quality of this necklace.
Amazing piece! There most exquisite zincite ring in the market. Katell provided excellent customer service with resizing. Highly recommend!
Very friendly and competent contact! The procedure was trouble-free and very simple and the jewellery s great and beautiful! Good handicraft quality Thank you very much.
Very friendly and competent contact! The procedure was trouble-free and very simple and the jewellery s great and beautiful! Good handicraft quality Thank you very much.
I highly recommend this earring! the shipment was very fast and maytal is super nice and very responsive. looks just like the photo :)
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
I purchased these ear climbers for my daughter as a gift. She loved them. They are beautiful and unique. I hesitated about ordering internationally but decided to take the chance considering they were my favorite when compared to many others listed. Maytal was in close contact with me throughout the shipping process with delays as expected due to the pandemic. Her customer service and concern were superb...she updated me frequently until they arrived at my post office. I would not hesitate in ordering from her in the future.
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"I love the these! I have been looking for jackets for my studs, and these are so fun!"
This shop is top shelf. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love my earring jackets and I look forward to getting more Thank you Carl you are awesome üëèüèªüòÉ
"Truly beautiful piece of jewelery! I was so surprised at how shiny and sparkly this was when I opened up the box. My original plan was to wear 1 snake earcuff then another simple stud on the other ear, the snake was so pretty that I immediately ordered a second 1 in silver to match the gold one. I can't wait till it gets here. I also bought a pair of the leaves studded earrings. I love them as well."
I absolutely LOVE these. Even prettier than I was expected I‚Äôm so in love 10/10 such a pretty pair!!
Beautiful earrings! I was expecting the posts to be the kind that kind of stick through with a long post and lay agains your ear (like most climbers I‚Äôve had) but it‚Äôs just a regular small post. Which is fine too! Great shipping and came in a nice box and ribbon ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love these earrings soo much! they don't twist. I 100% recommend
"I really like these ear climbers. They look really neat. It took me a little while to get them on correctly the first time, but once I got it just right, they look great. The seller shipped them out really fast and I'm really happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
"I‚Äôm in love! This toe ring is flat so it‚Äôs not uncomfortable with shoes on and it‚Äôs the perfect combination of flair without being ostentatious. This well made, unique toe ring isn‚Äôt too high off of the toe, bulky or boring. Highly recommend and would purchase again without question! Thank you, VelvetRubyStudio!"
These are beautiful. I also have the same style in silver. Classic. My absolute favorite earrings!
"Very cute- I have small ears, but these fit just fine after bending them to my ear a bit. High quality!"
"I love the earrings, they are more beautiful in person, very unique honey comb backing design, lightweight, great quality, no discomfort. I love the soft plush packaging and the hand written card and fast shipping too. I will definitely buy from this seller again!"
"Absolutely incredible! Shipping was much faster than I expected and they got here within a few days, the packaging was very neat and they came with a handwritten card. The photos of the earrings already look incredibly cute, but in person they somehow manage to be even more adorable! I've worn them daily since they arrived and had no issues with discomfort as I feared, they're easy to wear and very well made. Will absolutely be buying more from this shop in the future."
They are so beautiful I‚Äôm so in love with them they came in a cute little bag and such I nice thank you note overall very good everything and would definitely recommend!
"My earrings are so adorable! They‚Äôre quite darling & packaging was superb! The earrings are lightweight & what caught my attention, even more, is that Kellan & Kiera took time to handwrite a thank you card to their consumers! It was a personal & thoughtful touch. You don‚Äôt get that often with businesses. I‚Äôm definitely going to purchase more earrings in the near future & highly recommend others to support this small business, as well!"
"I absolutely love these earrings! I‚Äôve worn them many days and they are fabulous! They hang so nice and are a real attention getter. The bead work is perfection! They arrived so quickly, too! I‚Äôve since bought more. This seller is wonderful!"
"Boucles d'oreilles magnifiques, un service au top et une livraison des plus rapides ! Que demander de plus. Je suis ravie. Je recommande vivement cette boutique."
"These earrings are absolutely fabulous. They look so great with my mustards, yellows, and blacks. A jeweler friend today was very impressed with the workmanship! I love this seller's work! Highly recommend! <3"
"This is a FANTASTIC shop! The earrings are A very fine ,dainty quality. I like the fact that they are very contemporary but not heavy looking or feling, and I can easily customize each piece with the colors to match my outfits. The artist will send you all the colors of the beads for you to select just the right colors! she has numerous colors in each color category so you can get exactly the right colo9r to match. the sercie and communication is great. One of the best vendors I have worked with at Etsy!!!! I highly rec-commend this Artist. :-) Leslie Richards /Interior Designer, Naples, Florida"
"This isn‚Äôt my first order and won‚Äôt be my last! I am really, really, hard on the jewelry I decorate myself with. Really hard. I put whatever it is on and usually don‚Äôt take it off until it breaks or bends too much for comfort. I bought this piercing several years ago, put it in an upper cartridge piercing, showered, slept, roughhoused, tangled it with hair, brushed it, and occasionally caught a scarf or shirt thread in it. Not only is the earring adorable, it took a beating for about 4 years before just the little pearl came off (and I could have put it back on but I can‚Äôt see stuff that small anymore). Talk about well made and durable! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever owned a piercing that lasted that long. This time I got two, and ones in my tragus as well. Can‚Äôt go wrong with this artisan!"
"Beautiful jewellery, great quality and shipped really quickl. The colours in the picture were almost exactly as they were in real life and matched my wedding dress and colour theme perfectly! Would definitely buy from here again and recommend to friends and family :-)"
Absolutely beautiful! I am so glad I have found the perfect earrings.
Beautiful earring set! High quality. Seller was very helpful and worked with me when I had an issue. Can't wait to wear them out!
These are absolutely stunning!
"BO ""bon oeil"" Les anneaux suppl√©mentaires ajout√©s leur conf√®rent un air encore plus boh√©mien... Que les pr√©dictions soient fiables ! Les astres n'ont plus qu'√† bien se tenir. Lol. Merci Muriel, elles sont super."
Elles sont superbes! √âl√©gantes et l√©g√®res. L‚Äôassociation des couleurs est bien pens√©e. Muriel a beaucoup de go√ªt pour associer les couleurs et les formes. Je guette les nouveaut√©s !
I am in love with every set of Frida earrings I've purchased and these are no exception! So beautiful and so well made! Cannot rate highly enough! Delighted as always. Thank you ‚ù§
"Envoi tr√®s rapide et tr√®s soign√©, merci √† la cr√©atrice de SonAltessePtipois pour son √©coute, sa gentillesse et sa r√©activit√©. Je suis ravie de ces bien jolies boucles d'oreilles !"
Feathers mean a lot to me personally so they are just so STUNNING!!!! They are the perfect size. Absolutely in love!!! These are by far the most beautiful ever! I love ear climber type earrings they are so unique. These are so pretty and I am just so happy about how they turned out. I cannot thank you enough for these gorgeous earrings. You have a such a beautiful talent and gift! I cannot wait to buy more. You are such an amazing seller! Thank you! I will post pictures later!1
"These silver leaf ear climbers are some of the cutest earrings I have ever seen. They are small and dainty, but seem to be good quality. I love them! They are something that you can wear all the time, dressy or casual. They also are earrings you can sleep in that won‚Äôt poke you behind your ear. Fabulous! I‚Äôm so excited about them. They came so quickly too. I would be happy to order from this shop again. Thanks so much!!"
Love them!
"I absolutely love these! They shipped quickly, and one of them broke the first time I wore it which I found disappointing but VermeilSupplies immediately shipped me another pair. I wear one of them in my second ear piercing and love it and have gotten many compliments! :)"
"Parfait ! Comme pour ma premi√®re commande . J avais acheter la version Or pour Madame et elle les adorait tellement que je lui ai repris la version argent , et comme d habitude vraiment pas d√©√ßu!! Chlo√© prend soin de ses clients , envoi tr√®s rapidement les commandes . Nous sommes fans de sa boutique et continuerons √† acheter aupr√®s d elle ."
Super jolie paire de boucles üòç
"Absolutely beautiful earrings! Chloe is so sweet and kept me updated on where the package was, she also gave me two gorgeous little string bracelets. Will definitely be buying from her again!"
"Tr√®s beau, je suis plus enti√®rement satisfaite de ma commande et merci pour le petit bracelet en cadeau tr√®s mignon! Je recommande ++"
"Beautiful! After losing one of my earrings that I had been wearing daily for years, I ordered 3 pairs of earrings from Amy and all were exactly as pictured. These are such great designs for people like me who struggle to find minimal but classic jewelry to wear for all occasions. I will definitely consider this shop for future purchases and will happily recommend Squirrel's Nest Jewelry to my friends as well. Thanks Amy!"
"This is my second Squirrels Nest purchase, and I'm ready to buy again! These earrings are beautiful and I've already gotten many compliments on them. Shipping was fast too - score!"
"I've never received so many compliments about my earrings! These are wonderfully subtle but somehow both elegant and badass at the same time. And an additional unexpected bonus: as someone who sleeps with earrings in, I had gotten used to feeling my studs poke my cheek while falling asleep. No more!"
"These are just as they appear. Mine are Rose Gold, ultra light in weight and if you read the directions easy to put in...I speak from experience. I love the earrings!"
Absolutely love them!!!! A little tricky to latch but worth it!
"These are so beautiful! They came well packaged and quickly, with a personalized touch. I bought them as a little birthday gift to myself and i'm so happy I did. They were exactly as pictured. Delicate and bold at the same time. <3 Thank you!"
"I've been trying to do the mismatched look for so long but it never looked right, these are perfect for a subtle mismatched look without people thinking you put different earrings in by mistake"
"Love, love, love. This pair is well made, unique, BEAUTIFUL, versatile, chic and sexy! Leave it to the French! It's everything a woman can ask for! It's great for work and for play. I have gotten compliments everywhere. The fact that it's got both silver, gold AND ROSE gold tones on it means it gets a lot of mileage in the my wkly rotation. Will be sharing the name of the shop next time I'm asked! This was shipped FAST w/tracking and packaged ready to gift. SUPER PLEASED. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SHOP!!!"
De belles boucles d'oreilles achet√©es pour l'anniversaire de ma meilleure amie qui a ador√©e ! De m√™me que toutes les copines qui √©taient pr√©sentes ! Plusieurs d'entre elles m'ont d'ailleurs demand√© o√π je les avais eu !
These are amazing and so lightweight! I love them!
"Les arums sont assez grandes mais leurs l√©g√®ret√©s les rends agr√©ables √† porter! Elles sont jolies, Douces et chic! J'adore !"
I sent these as a gift to wear to Disney but item arrived after They arrived home from Disney üòî late. But they loved them
Very cute and delicate. Items shipped quickly.
I love it!!! Super cute and it came on time. The only thing I didn‚Äôt know was that it doesn‚Äôt come in as a pair but everything else was great. Totally getting another one
"So cute! Really shiny and well made. I tried to take a picture, but my old phone just doesn‚Äôt do the necklace justice. I would definitely recommend!"
Tr√®s belles boucles d'oreilles tr√®s lumineuses
"Je suis ravie, comme toujours. Les boucles sont superbes et arriv√©es en un temps record. Le collier r√©ponds parfaitement √† mes attentes et la personnalisation demand√©es √† √©t√© respect√©e, je suis aux anges! Merci encore de votre efficacit√©!"
I realy like this bracelet the shop made .looks so light on my wrist i put my little tiny pendant on it .i going to do the same with the necklace i just ordered .yesterday.. Thanks so much .from the usa...... I love French stuff.
Necklace is very beautiful!!! Great quality! I got length 38 and it fits perfect! Love it!
"First, let me say, I love this jewelry. That's why I gave it 5 stars. I love the Aloha necklace with the Blue Peruvian together. I will say, they are a lot daintier than I thought they were going to be. Not a bad thing, but I just wasn't expecting that. I'm a little nervous about breaking the chain. But, like I said, not a bad thing, just couldn't tell from the pictures how lite/small these pieces are. Again. Love the jewelry, and would buy from her again. Shipping took a little longer than expected, but I am in Boston and they are coming from Cali. Also, Cheryl was very accommodating and sweet in her replies to email questions I had. Also, the package came with a very nice handwritten note from Cheryl. Always nice to have a personal touch!"

"OBSESSED with this necklace. I've wanted it for probably a year now and have kept my eye on it -- just recently decided to buy. It's gorgeous and so well made. The lettering isn't exactly like the photo but that doesn't bother me. Great seller, great necklace, fast turnaround time! Thanks so much!"
"First, let me say, I love this jewelry. That's why I gave it 5 stars. Fits my wrist perfectly and I have smaller wrists. I have a hard time finding jewelry that I can tighten around my wrist to my liking. I will say, it is a lot daintier than I thought it was going to be. Not a bad thing, but I just wasn't expecting that. I'm a little nervous about breaking the chain. But, like I said, not a bad thing, I just couldn't tell from the pictures how thin this bracelet is.

"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
Kathleen from Macalania has to be one of the kindest shop managers on all of Etsy! I had experienced shipping delays due to COVID which was not her fault at all and she made sure to send out a second pair of earrings so that they would arrive in time for a gift. She consistently tracked and updated my order to make sure I felt reassured the entire time. Her generosity and kindness went above and beyond! The earrings are GORGEOUS they are delicate and shined to perfection and I love so much that they are a gold and silver color which will allow me to match with all my other jewelry. They are amazingly minimal and make the perfect gift for all your designer friends!! I cannot thank her enough for this beautiful gift and I cannot wait to buy from this shop again! Thank you thank you ‚ú®‚ú® And they were shipped with extra backings!
I absolutely love these earrings. The stone stud is the perfect size and I love the detail on the circles. I want them in onyx too!
Thank you! This style of earring was hard to find. I needed them to put together a hairspray movie inspired outfit.
"Great earrings! Lightweight and work perfect with my second piercing (not too wide, so no overlap)"
These earrings are beautiful and shipped quickly. I received many compliments and reordered as a gift. Definitely recommend!
very very shiny. from photo they appeared more of a matt finish. disappointed.
"These earrings are just what I was looking for! They are dainty and unique, perfect for my everyday wear. Thanks Kate for great communication and lovely packaging! I'm impressed. :)"
These earrings are gorgeous! I put them on as soon as I received them. They are so comfortable to wear and look so cool. The earrings were securely packaged and arrived quickly. Also included was a cleaning cloth and lovely note. I will definitely be back! Thank you Kate.
"I love these so much, they are beautiful earrings!"

17-year old great niece loved them! Her first pair of climbers.
"My new favorite climber earrings! Unique, comfortable to wear, and perfect size. Great quality, not flimsy where you are afraid the will easily break!!"
"These earrings are super cute! They look just like the pictures, and fit fine. For some reason the hook is square, but it doesn't make a difference. Shipping to me in the states took a little while, but not too long. In fact, they arrived just in time for my birthday, which I didn't expect!"
"Juste magnifique, je suis tr√®s contente"
"Magnifique ! Commande conforme √† la description, boucles d'oreilles encore + belles en vrai !"
Les √©pingles √† cheveux sont magnifiques et raffin√©es. La qualit√© est au rendez-vous üòç
"I absolutely LOVE these earrings!! I would 20/10 recommend, they seem to be high quality and look like the pictures posted online. I accidentally thought ‚Äúsingle‚Äù meant one pair of earrings, but it means just one earring (for anyone thinking the same way I did). Regardless, I love this shop and can‚Äôt wait to buy more products."
I am so so in love with this bracelet! It is so beautiful and the moonstone was definitely chosen with care. Chlo√© is so sweet and will do everything she can to make sure you love your purchase.
"I‚Äôm so in love with my little moon necklace! It‚Äôs absolutely perfect. I ordered it pretty last minute for a wedding and Chloe was so sweet and understanding. She had it packaged almost immediately after I placed my order and had it shipped quick so that I would receive it in time! Thank you, Chloe!"
"This cowry anklet is exactly what I was looking for, simple and elegant! It fits perfect! Chlo√® was really helpful in making sure the length was exactly what I wanted. She was quick with her responses to my questions. Shipped and arrived in less than a week, thank you!"
I get comments about these ear pins all the time! They are so unique. I have one piercing and the bar goes through and then the rest of the piece is tilted up the ear lobe to cover the entire lobe. They are beautiful and very sparkly.
Received both pairs today..they are beautiful!!
These are so adorable! I recommend them!
"Thank you so much, I love them!"
"I‚Äôve been searching for peace sign hoops like this for some time now, and am so glad I found By Bella! The earrings are high quality, beautifully made, and exactly as pictured. I love that the business does such wonderful community outreach, and feel good knowing I‚Äôve contributed even just a small bit to their mission. These will be a joy to wear :)"
"Best face mask. Breathable! Fits exceptionally well, very pretty, shipped promptly. Good nosewire (really does keep the glasses from fogging!) and very happy to have the ear loop adjusters. Wore it today for the first time. It is my new FAV!! Conversed with someone for over an hour and the mask stayed in place! I think it may be that the origami style is the best one on the market. This one checks all the boxes for the right stuff!! Priced well too."
I love them!
"It was JUST what we needed. I really like the 3-D fit especially for my children who cannot see to keep a mask over their noses and these are perfect. They also have a filter pocket, which was necessary in my book. In addition, my children's and husband's ears get tires after full days of wear and this vendor was able to make them around the head versus earloops, which is something no other vendor was willing to do!!! Had to buy more!"
"Envoi super rapide et soign√©, produit conforme et de bonne qualit√©, je recommande ! (et je vais re-commander :))"
"Superbe qualit√©, un style de fou üî•Franchement foncez les yeux ferm√©s ! Livraison √† temps, et surtout bijoux qui ne bouge pas malgr√© la douche, la chaleur ou autre..."
Tr√®s satisfait de la qualit√© des porte clefs ! Arriv√©s 3 jours apr√®s commande.
"These earrings are just what I was looking for! They are dainty and unique, perfect for my everyday wear. Thanks Kate for great communication and lovely packaging! I'm impressed. :)"
I love them! Absolutely perfect üòç
These earrings are gorgeous! I put them on as soon as I received them. They are so comfortable to wear and look so cool. The earrings were securely packaged and arrived quickly. Also included was a cleaning cloth and lovely note. I will definitely be back! Thank you Kate.
"Earrings are super cute just as described, I love the design with those little hearts. Just gorgeous!!!!"
"Vraiment super belle sur l'oreille, je l'adore! (je ne sais pas si c'est la forme de mon oreille mais elle tombe parfois de l'oreille, je dois la replacer)"
These are beautiful earrings. They are ever bit as pretty as in the pictures and the quality is great. I had to work a bit to get them on because they fit differently on the ear - but that is just practice. They are lovely and look wonderful.
Really beautiful artistry! Excellent packaging and quickly shipped! Highly recommend!
These are beautiful and arrived quickly. The problem is with my ears - I think they are too small for the climbers to stay put. Pretty nonetheless.
Vraiment magnifiques boucles d oreilles
"Pas vraiment ce √† quoi que je m‚Äôattendais, boucles de couleurs diff√©rentes, l‚Äôune claire l‚Äôautre fonc√©e et cr√©oles plus petites que ce que je voulais ( apparement je n‚Äôai pas bien lu ... car on m‚Äôa signal√© que les dimensions √©taient notifi√©es )"
"Bonjour, Je comprends votre d√©ception m√™me si je pense que √ßa ne m√©rite pas une √©valuation √† 1 √©toile... D√®s r√©ception de votre r√©clamation, je vous ai propos√© le remboursement et l'√©change ( o√π vous auriez pu choisir la paire de cr√©oles en bois ) que vous avez refus√©... Je vous ai envoy√© un code promotionnel de -10% sur toute la boutique valable jusqu'√† la fin de l'ann√©e. Et effectivement les dimensions ( en mm ou en cm ) sont toujours pr√©cis√©es sur mes fiches produits pour √©viter ce genre de d√©convenues. Qu'aurais-je pu faire de plus?"

"Th√®se earrings are stunning in person. The 100 year old filigree is in unbelievable condition. Like all my in store and Etsy purchases from here, the quality of the product is very high and despite my sensitive ears, I have never had an adverse reaction from their products. Despite my limited French, the owner always speaks English for my benefit."
Parfait ! Agr√©able √† porter.

"I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you. Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*"

This bracelet is amazing I wear it everyday and get so many compliments. Communication and shipping was great. Thank you
The earrings are very nice and packaging was Wonderful !
"Beautiful pair of earrings, great seller communication!! Thank you so much"
"I love these earrings! I bought gold hoops from Yaela a few months ago, and these silver ones are just as perfect; lightweight and beautiful, with an even easier spring-clasp, so they feel secure. Very happy!"
Love these earrings! It‚Äôs very light and I like that the earring is click-down style because I find it easier to close when it is like this. Also not to long to where it will get caught in something or my hair. I feel like they are totally worth the money. It is really well made and would buy again. Thank you MyJoolis! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"These earrings are my daily wearers now. They're just the right size, lightweight and a very nice finish which doesn't discolor against my skin! I most definitely will be purchasing more items from YaelaJewels!!"
"Was looking for a simple pair of gold hoops that I could wear every day and these are perfect! The only issue is they have a difficult clasp that makes them somewhat hard to put on, but other then that they are great earrings!"
"Absolutely am in love with these earrings - theyre so light, beautiful, and I've never felt pretty with earrings before! Much thanks for arranging clip ons! Will order from here again!"
"Beautiful earrings and such a lovely design, so well made. Lovely and light in my ears. I get so many compliments. The seller Pnina responds so quickly to messages and delightful to chat to. Highly recommend jewellery and the service. The delivery was quick too. Thank you Pnina."
Beautiful earrings! When I saw them I wanted to know how long they would be and she sent me a picture right away.
Great customer service and equally great products! I just love my new earrings. Their quality is top notch and I get compliments when I wear them......which is all the time.
"Very nice ""construktion"" idea and it looks great! Also its very well made - thin and noble. Thank you very much to greece!"
So so beautiful! Unique and stunning. I love them.
"The earrings were a gift for my mother‚Äôs birthday, she loved them so much! The earrings are so beautiful and so well made. Love the zero waste packaging as well :)"
beautiful earrings! definitely a work of art!
"I was hesitant to order these earrings from Greece due to shipping time. However, shipping and customer service was amazing. I received the item quickly. Quality is great. So glad I ordered. Thank you for the beautiful earrings. Can‚Äôt wait to show them off! üòä"
"I am INCREDIBLY happy with these earrings and the service I received. I get so many compliments on these climbers, and they were exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for for SO long. Highly recommend!"
Gorgeous! I love them!!! The design is unique and feels special.
"Love them! A bit tricky to get on in a hurry and don‚Äôt always stay in place, but once they‚Äôre in, they‚Äôre perfect!"
"Great, quality earrings! I have the .45‚Äù hoops in my first piercing, the .4‚Äù hoops in my second, and the CZ studs in my third (all from this shop.) I‚Äôve had them for over a month and they still look brand new with daily wear."

Loveee these everyday earrings!! At first the hoops were a bit too big but I adjusted them so they hug my ear
:) :) :) :) bienn
"If you're looking for a pair of unique, well-crafted, and unique hoops, look no further! These are perfect for everyday (and night) wear, and I also love that they clearly stand out in comparison with mass-manufactured earrings. The seller was really lovely and accommodating, and it's obvious that she does everything with love. Thank you!"
"‚ÄòTwas tired of replacing horseshoes after I inevitably lost the ends so I figured I‚Äôd switch it up ~ was a tad nervous on how the style would look on me but wowoww what a lovely septum ring! The sizing is perfect, it‚Äôs incredible lightweight/ comfortable & v high quality! + I usually struggle with rings that bend but this one was super easy and holds shape. Thank yous üåøü™±‚ú®"
"These earrings embody understated elegance, and were just what I was looking for. I had my eye on them for a while, and am glad I treated myself. Beautiful, delicate craftsmanship. Would highly recommend."
"Finally found my dream hoops! Perfect size and shape for everyday but also special occasions. High quality material, so definitely worth the price. Thank you <3"

"I love my ear cuff and many people have commented on it! In fact I love it so much that after losing it ( my fault totally) I bought another one because I missed it! It's very comfortable to wear, slips on easily and remains firmly in place. I would highly recommend it!"
Beautiful ear climber and perfect size. I wore this on my wedding day and absolutely love it ! Have had several friends comment on how unique it is and now they want one too. Would defiantly buy again! Very friendly seller and super quick postage. Thanks a Million !
E' stata un'avventura ricevere l'orecchino ma ringrazio ancora Debora per la sua disponibilit√† e gentilezza. Ha provveduto subito a rinviarmi un altro pezzo non avendo mai ricevuto il primo e sono super soddisfatta dell'acquisto!! E' bellissimo e puoi regolarlo in base alle dimensioni del tuo orecchio. Assolutamente consigliato!
"Stunning earrings! Absolutely love them. Very thoughtful to include instructions on how to put them in, as that first time is a bit like a puzzle. Fast delivery to. Would definitely recommend."
Tr√®s belle! Je vous remercie pour ces boucles d‚Äôoreilles - vous √™tre une v√©ritable artiste.
"Je suis ravie , tr√®s jolie bague tr√®s fine et √©l√©gante, tr√®s bonne communication, vendeuse tr√®s sympa, livraison rapide F√©licitations pour votre joli site, √† bient√¥t pour d'autres achats"
Superbe ! Prendre plus grand que la taille initiale car l'√©lastique serre un peu. J'ai eu la chance de pouvoir la renvoyer pour un ajustement sans frais suppl√©mentaires. Merci !
Tr√®s jolie petite bague. Commande envoy√©e rapidement et joliment emball√©. Merci encore pour la personnalisation !

This is honestly the best experience I've ever had on Etsy. I wanted a custom made piece and Bailey was so friendly and kind. I got the piece quite fast and I'm so happy with it. Thank you so much!
"Although the item was too big for my ear, Charlie was very keen to help me and even offered to make a smaller version of the item for me. She was always prompt, helpful and polite, and gave exceptional customer service. I can‚Äôt wait to peruse the rest of her shop and find something that fits!"
"This is actually the second time I have purchased these exact earrings as I accidentally lost one in a storm and just had to replace them immediately, they're so beautiful. They are surprisingly light weight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time, if you've never used this type of clasp before, it is a little tricky to fasten to start with as they are so fine and delicate, but you learn quickly. The guage of the hoops as well means that you can easily add on or remove other charms if you wanted. As these are hand made, the silver bar length does vary between batches, this didn't matter to me, but be mindful that you could end up with either short or long bars differing from the picture (my second pair are longer than my original pair). Overall, great quality, classic design and no reaction with my sensitive skin."
I love these cute little earrings! I ordered the smallest size but found it smaller than I‚Äôd like so asked for an exchange. Bailey was extremely helpful and thoughtful and sent me a bigger size without waiting for me to return the original earrings. Will definitely be buying again from her and recommend her jewellery to everyone!
"C'est juste ""magnifique"" d'une po√©sie et d'une d√©licatesse, vraiment je suis sous le charme. Un travail d√©licat et raffin√©, je suis fan √† 1000%"
Absolutely amazing. A work of art for my ears! I love them so much!!
Je suis ravie de mon achat. Quel adorable univers ! Le petit dragon est vraiment mignon et r√©alis√© avec beaucoup de soin et de finesse ‚ù§Ô∏è J'en avais besoin en urgence pour un anniversaire et la cr√©atrice a fait tout son possible pour que je le re√ßoive a temps !

"These earrings are so well made and my sisters LOVE them! This seller is helpful, polite, and custom made these for me as he had sold out of this particular design. Once lockdown had eased they were promptly delivered - and they came with a free gift which was completely unexpected! Would order from this shop again!"
"Superbes, brillantes, jolies couleurs üíì"
Very pretty earrings. Really wonderful shop to purchase from.
Love it for a whisical look but the gold does start to come off pretty quickly
These are pretty but very fragile. I don't think I will have them long. The wire bends as you put them in your ears. But... They are very pretty!
I love the look of these but they are super thin and bend really easily.
Super cute.
"Cutest earrings ever!! and they arrived super quickly. I love them so much, thank you!"
"My customized climber arrived fast, in beautiful, sparkling condition, and I'm obsessed! The seller is super sweet and helpful. My new favorite jeweler! Thank you so much!"
"I love this climber earring. I thought it would be bigger, but it fits my ear perfectly. Next time I'll get one that goes all the way up my ear. This one goes about half way. I got the right side only- to wear during my wedding ceremony. It's very comfortable."
"Definite show stoppers! My ears a bit small for the top claps, but I will sort it out. Beautiful!"
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much!
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
Beautiful beyond words! The pictures do no justice. The detail is amazing and the red opal is stunning! The entire nose screw is made very well and I highly recommend this shop! Shipping was fast and I received my nose studs almost 2 weeks sooner than expected. The nose studs came in a very cute jewelry box and the entire thing was well packaged. Thank you to TitaniumFashion for creating beautiful products and for the amazing customer service! I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again.

"Superbes boucles d'oreilles, ces chats sont magnifiques , j'adore !!! :) Bravo √† la fabuleuse cr√©atrice et merci beaucoup pour le cadeau !!! :) :) :)"
So pretty! I love wearing it with a stud in my other ear for an asymmetrical look. The post is heavy duty. If you have small sensitive ear holes it will take some getting used to.
Elles sont tr√®s fines d√©licates. seule b√©mol moi qui ne porte pas de boucles d'oreilles hormis celles-ci les accroches en argent sont un peu larges en m√™me temps c'est plus r√©sistant mais √ßa enl√®ve un chouillat de d√©licatesse. cela dit je n'ai eu que des compliments. Merci.
Des couleurs plus tourn√©es vers le brun que le roux. Les reflets bleus sont repris avec une perle bleue. Des boucles d'oreilles d'une tr√®s grande d√©licatesse ! Elles sont superbes!
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles √âtat ""au poil""...ou plut√¥t ""√† la plume"" !"
"UPDATE EDIT Since writing my previous review about the Rose-gold colour wearing off after only a few weeks, the seller got in contact with me very quickly to try and solve the issue. After a bit of back and forth they have arranged a new necklace to be sent, with better quality. Overall I am very happy with this purchace, it is clear the seller very much cares about what she is selling and the customer serviec when something went wrong was great. Also the necklaces are very cute, both me and my girlfriend love them!"
"Bought as an anniversary gift, and its just perfect, thank yo uso much! Very quick delivery, and the pieces themselves are lovely."
"Cathy was absolutely wonderful at responding and catering to my wishes - she spent a lot of time talking with me about chain sizes, colours, and even expanded her chain collection to offer more choices. The necklace itself is dainty and gorgeous, perfect chain size and colour and is very petite and beautiful. Thank you!"

The Ear Jackets are really pretty! Everything was perfect!
"Beautiful, well made earrings! Very good communication from the seller - friendly and helpful."
None of the stores here including Macy's have anything this unique and attractive. They are extremely well made and light and comfortable to wear. Beautiful earrings made by a fine artisan. Would definitely buy from Yael again.
"Lovely pair of earrings. I love the aesthetic and overall look of it. I can still see some leftover glue to where the pearl is attached to, but it is fixable on my end. Thank you so much for accommodating my order! The color is gorgeous and I can't wait to wear it. Thank you! :)"
Un grand merci...super contente des boucles personne tr√®s agr√©able et √† l √©coute...je garde en favoris...Et je conseille √† 100%

They look exactly like the pictures. Absolutely beautiful and they don't bother my ears!
"This is the second time I have purchased jewelry from Jen and honestly, I wish I could buy everything she makes! Follower her on Instagram and you‚Äôll feel the same! That‚Äôs how I found these midi hoops and laurel stems I got myself for Christmas (I mean, ‚Äúfrom my husband‚Äù...). I got the extra pair of laurel stems for my mother. My daughter‚Äôs name is Laurel so these earrings are special for both of us, and not to mention simply beautiful!"
"These are just lovely. Beautiful and delicate. They were shipped from England to California and I could get regular tracking updates. Thank you, Jen!"
"The ring is absolutely stunning and well-crafted!! My first order had a slight size issue, but Jen was super sweet in making sure I got a product that was perfectly suited for me. She provided the best customer service and the shipping was surprisingly fast given that it was international and the pandemic. I'm in love with the ring and highly recommend Jen's work!!"
"I really love my ring, I will wear it everyday ! It is very minimalist, cute and dainty ! It‚Äôs incredible how the ring was very well made ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm sorry I wish I could post more pictures ! I really loved this design and asked Jomu if it was possible to make it in solid rose gold 18K and in an Europe size (I have thin fingers so rings need to be custom made). And after asking her team, it was possible, best news ! She was very nice, casted away all my doubts and answered all the questions I had ! She reassured me and helped me with the shipping to France. The ring came with a very cute little box/packaging and was vaccum sealed with a lot of bubble wrap, it was very secure ! I totally recommend Hyphen Minimalist, consisting of Jomu and her team, who were very lovely and helpful with me ! Thank you very much ! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"These moonstone earrings are exquisitely made ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ I am totally blown away by the blue glow of the stones and the delicate beauty of the tiny hearts. They are so tiny you have to move in close to see them. I love that: classic at a first glance, but when you look closer, they are simply unique. Perfect for my daughter's first precious earrings! I cannot thank Jomu enough for her kindness & helpfulness, up to the final step of shipping to France ‚Äì always complicated with solid gold. We had fun exchanging about the meanings of stones; her sweetness really heart-warming. I love her idea of suggesting a gift note! She managed to fit in a long note -although I suggested shortening it ;) Knowing my daughter, she will keep the card in her jewelry box forever. My buying experience with Jomu will be a joy to remember. Thank you Jomu ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
I absolutely adore my ring. Fabulous quality and it complements my wedding and engagement rings perfectly. Delivery took about 6 weeks but it was worth the wait!
"very cute earrings, my friend loves them and they're good quality. One flaw was that it took very long to get here, but that;s expected as I live in america and they came from Thailand, however they did arrive after the date it was expected to come and i got a little worried. Overall, I would purchase again and it was well worth the wait."
Vraiment magnifiques boucles d oreilles
Fun to wear - even caught the eye of the nurse administering my Covid vaccine!
This piece is very unique. The first time I wore it I received so many compliments. My ears are very sensitive to different metals and I didn't have any issues.
Love wearing this. Super easy transaction.
"Holy cow I ADORE these earrings! Beautiful, understated, and came super fast. Pro tip you have to twist them in backwards (from the back of your piercing instead of the front) to get them to lay right--took me wayy to long to figure out but was super easy once I did!"
Hermoso..!!!
"Love love love!! Absolutely gorgeous!! I reached out to Jordan to make this custom piece to match my husband‚Äôs wedding ring. She was so attentive, let me part of the process with picking stones and the setting. She‚Äôs amazing and her artistic work is impeccable! I just love this ring and have already gotten so many compliments. This is my second piece and I look forward to purchasing more pieces in the future. You will not be disappointed in anything you purchase from her. üíó"
"I received my moon phase ear climbers pretty quickly! It's sooooo beautiful! I'm wore it immediately after opening my package. You do have to adjust the wire, but that's not a problem to me! Overall, I LOVE IT! Thank you sooo much!"
"My blue labradorite ring is great! The color range is shimmery gray to a striking electric blue; the cut really enhances the glow. The ring fits perfectly and it's very comfortable to wear. Jordan was very helpful to work with, she provided pictures of available stones and made sure that I got the right color. I highly recommend this Artisan!"
Beautiful Handcraft. The finitions are very clean. Keep up the great work and thanks a lot for the beautiful creations ! : ))
Alweer prachtige oorbellen. Fijn en degelijk afgewerkt. En snel geleverd in een prachtige verpakking.
"Aucun regret, je les adore ! Elles s'accordent √† tous les styles ! Le m√©lange d'argent et de laiton est lumineux et frais. Merci Ushas ! Je reviendrai ;-)"
"J'adore l'identit√© de cette boutique. Bijou de qualit√©, emballage soign√© et rapide, et ces boucles sont √† tomb√©es ! La douceur se fait ressentir sur les cr√©ations, je pense rapidement recommander, si vous h√©sitez, foncez !"
Un grand merci...super contente des boucles personne tr√®s agr√©able et √† l √©coute...je garde en favoris...Et je conseille √† 100%
cadeau qui a fait tr√®s plaisir

"Absolutely love these, they‚Äôre so beautifully made. Lovely little hand written note was much appreciated aswell. Thanks so much :)"
The earrings look even better in person! Very detailed and beautiful.
These are different and beautiful!! I am happy with the purchase and would buy from this seller again.
"J'ai achet√© ces boucles d'oreilles pour l'anniversaire d'une amie. Le colis a √©t√© envoy√© directement chez elle et elle a √©t√© ravie. Elle adore ses nouvelles boucles d'oreilles, elles sont juste superbes et de bonnes qualit√©s ! Merci Taliwear"
Boucles d'oreilles superbes ! Envoie rapide et soign√© ! Merci üôè beaucoup !
"Super, je les adore...."
Superbes ! conforme √† la description et √† la photo. Merci
"I loved this ear crawler so much, I decided to get 2 to make it a set."
"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop ü•∞, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again üòÅ"
Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!
"I am so thrilled with my purchases. They are exactly as expected from the photo and came in such gorgeous packaging too. It all felt very special, like getting a gift from a friend! Highly recommend buying from this lovely seller, absolutely beautiful quality and attention to detail."
Mignonnes comme tout! Merci.
"These are so stunning! They say copper and silver, but I bought the full silver set. They are elegant and unique and beautifully hand-crafted. Cannot recommend Claudine Moncion enough - she does fabulous work."
"elles sont vraiment tr√®s belles!! Si comme moi vous avez des lobes d'oreilles plus grands, je vous sugg√®re fortement de contacter Claudine pour qu'elle les ajuste afin que √ßa entre bien et que ce soit confortable."
Beautiful and original! Very comfortable to wear and surprisingly light on the lobes. I love them. They arrived quickly despite potential delays caused by lower Canada Post services. They were packaged very securely and safely. Can't wait to show them off. :)
So lovely! She even made a slight adjustment to the size of the earring for me in order for them to work for the location of my piercing! This is my first time wearing ear climbers like this so I had to play with them a little bit until I got them to a point where they were comfortable and yet wouldn‚Äôt fall down. Very happy with them now!
"Francesca is an excellent seller! The order was delayed by 1 day due to a shipping delay from a supplier. She contacted me immediately to let me know of the delay and even shipped the item by priority mail at her own expense. The earrings were beautiful!! If I could give her an extra star as a bonus, I would!"
Love these. Just what I wanted.
"I bought two of the same nose ring, one in rose gold and one in gold. The quality is amazing, the price is incredibly reasonable, and the shipping was so fast! Highly recommend and would buy from this seller again."
I love these! I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on them. Shipping took longer than either the seller or I anticipated but he was quick to respond and actually sent a second pair when it looked like they wouldn‚Äôt show. The original pair showed up the next week!
"I absolutely love these. They are delicate and beautiful and make me feel so cool! I love that they donate to science education for every purchase. I will buy from this store again, 100% sure of it!"
"These earrings are perfect! I have gotten compliments and my STEM friends love them. I like how they hug my ear, I only wear them as climbers. I have worn them multiple days and only had to adjust them once. I will definitely consider buying from this store again, the customer service is phenomenal as well."
These looked so cute in my friend's second ear holes with her large plugs.
Beautiful and original! Very comfortable to wear and surprisingly light on the lobes. I love them. They arrived quickly despite potential delays caused by lower Canada Post services. They were packaged very securely and safely. Can't wait to show them off. :)

"Pas vraiment ce √† quoi que je m‚Äôattendais, boucles de couleurs diff√©rentes, l‚Äôune claire l‚Äôautre fonc√©e et cr√©oles plus petites que ce que je voulais ( apparement je n‚Äôai pas bien lu ... car on m‚Äôa signal√© que les dimensions √©taient notifi√©es )"

"Every little piece is a masterpiece, love its delicate beauty! I wear them climbing up and hanging down :) sensitive skin friendly! Thank you!"
"These are now my favorite earrings. Original, earthy design. I -never- see conifer jewelry. Also, perfectly curved to follow the ear lobe. Beautiful!"
"They finally arrived and I love them, thank you! They took a long time to get here (NOT the seller‚Äôs fault - it was USPS and customs) but I am so happy with them :)"
These crawler earrings were wonderful and I love them.
"Very nice ""construktion"" idea and it looks great! Also its very well made - thin and noble. Thank you very much to greece!"
So so beautiful! Unique and stunning. I love them.

"The earrings are fantastic... but what really made my day was the handwritten note, beautiful packaging and extra gift included. My Heavenly Atelier goes over and above!"
I love the design of these earrings so much that I had to buy them for my friends in silver. The seller is wonderful to work with and the earrings are beautifully made.
"The earrings were exactly like the picture, and they're practically weightless when you wear them! The packaging was divine - Maggie was lovely to communicate with - and the little surprise in my shipment was just icing on the cake. :) Thank you so much, can't wait to shop here again!"
"The earrings I ordered are absolutely beautiful and unique, I love them!She also sent a handwritten letter and an extra set of earrings as a gift, it was thoughtful and good business! I will definitely be buying from this shop in the future! :D"
"Tr√®s fines et tr√®s jolies boucles. Elles me rappellent ma belle mimine noire...Par contre, je mets une attache en silicone car j'ai peur de les perdre tant la cha√Æne est fine. Merci"
Merci infiniment ! Clous d'oreilles parfaits pour compl√©ter mon pr√©c√©dent achat. ma fille est plus que ravie. Et merci pour le cadeau √©galement ... Je suis tr√®s touch√©e. :-)
"Gorgeous, elegant earrings. Arrived quickly- 6 days to Canada. Girlfriend loves them! Gill replies very quickly to messages, and is extremely helpful. I ordered a customized pendant to complement these, it was beautifully made. Very happy."
Agr√©ablement surprise par la finesse de ce pendentif qui devrait faire des envieuses dans mon entourage. Tr√®s satisfaite de mon achat. Vivement les beaux jours et le retour des tenues d√©collet√©es qui mettront le bijou en valeur !
"Great, quality earrings! I have the .45‚Äù hoops in my first piercing, the .4‚Äù hoops in my second, and the CZ studs in my third (all from this shop.) I‚Äôve had them for over a month and they still look brand new with daily wear."

"Ich habe lange auf meinen Schmuck. Am 10.04. bestellt, angeblich 1-2 Wochen Lieferzeit, am 24.4. angeblich verschickt. Ich schreibe ""angeblich"", weil in Etsy unter Eink√§ufe bis zuletzt ""Vor Versand"" zu lesen war. Am 11.05. ist der Schmuck endlich eingetroffen, ob die Verz√∂gerung wegen der Pandemie eingetreten ist oder nicht kann ich nicht sagen. Eigenartig war es auf jeden Fall! Meine Korrespondenz wurde innerhalb einiger Tage bearbeitet und beantwortet. Diese Ohrringe und das Armband sind sch√∂n anzusehen, aber qualitativ gefallen sie mir nicht. Die Klappcreole schlie√üt nur mit einem ""bitte"" und ich f√ºrchte, sie wird definitiv irgendwann den Ohrring frei geben, ob ich will oder nicht. Beide sind f√ºr meinen Geschmack zu leicht, sie f√ºhlen sich nicht wie vergoldetes Silber an. Der Preis scheint gerecht, mehr Wert ist er nicht."
Parfait ! De magnifiques boucles d'oreilles d√©licates et tr√®s √©l√©gantes. Merci beaucoup !
So chic! I love the look especially if you stage it with other earrings
I ordered it the 2nd time because this piece of jewelry is simply breathtaking. I love it so much. Thank you for your creativity Best regards Pia
"Absolutely love these earrings, I ordered them on a hoop but also got sent a pair of hooks so I can change them up when I want to. I also received a free pair of earrings which was such a nice surprise, not to mention the free haribos and cute packaging!"
"So pleased with these! Packaged so beautifully, just as cute as expected, can‚Äôt wait to get a chance to wear them!"
Bought these and the daisy chain earrings and I absolutely love both!! They arrived super quickly and were packaged nicely with a cute little thank you note:) Also the seller was super accommodating and included both hooks and hoops for these earrings so I can change them if I want to:) will deffo buy from here again
Abesolutley over the moon with my custom earrings. Artist made them in the requested colours and I am very impressed with the quality and final look :)! Love them very happy.
"Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again."
"Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy! I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently."
These earrings are absolutely adorable!!! I loved them and instantly put them in. I have not bought any earrings that climb your ear so I was nervous but they look great!!!
It's so stinking cute!! The skulls lined up just right on my toe. Two days later it broke while I sleeping! I'm so sad.. May be better as small ring for the top of your finger...
I ordered two sets of earrings and love them both! This open hoop is a little big for my ear but I just tilt it up and it works perfectly. I tried it in my first hole and ended up liking it better in my second.
"I love these earrings! Very dainty and modern. I love pairing the dot and the triangle together. I do find they can rotate a bit after sleeping on them, but I've worn them for a couple of weeks now and I've had no issues with them falling out at all! They stay put well and they're very comfortable to wear. I also have very sensitive ears and I've had no irritation with these! Would absolutely recommend these and get them again."
These are beyond gorgeous and the perfect size! Now I don't have to take all of my earrings out every night before bed because my head isn't being stabbed by the standard posts. I'm in love and never going back!
"So comfortable and adorable for everyday wear! I was confused with how to order a pair, the seller was helpful and honest when I ordered two single hoops and refunded me for the overpayment. If you want a pair, select 2 hoops; it doesn't mean it has two hoops, it means, you get a matching pair of single hoops!"
"Je suis ravie, tout est parfait"
I love this pendant. It is so unusual and I very much enjoy it's distinct form and colors.
"Superbe collier, je l'ai re√ßu dans les temps. Trop contente de mon achat üòâüòä"
"C'est tr√®s joli, livr√© rapidement et avec soin, merci"
"My customized climber arrived fast, in beautiful, sparkling condition, and I'm obsessed! The seller is super sweet and helpful. My new favorite jeweler! Thank you so much!"
"I love this climber earring. I thought it would be bigger, but it fits my ear perfectly. Next time I'll get one that goes all the way up my ear. This one goes about half way. I got the right side only- to wear during my wedding ceremony. It's very comfortable."
"Definite show stoppers! My ears a bit small for the top claps, but I will sort it out. Beautiful!"
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much!
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
Beautiful beyond words! The pictures do no justice. The detail is amazing and the red opal is stunning! The entire nose screw is made very well and I highly recommend this shop! Shipping was fast and I received my nose studs almost 2 weeks sooner than expected. The nose studs came in a very cute jewelry box and the entire thing was well packaged. Thank you to TitaniumFashion for creating beautiful products and for the amazing customer service! I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again.
Love it. Thanks.
Tr√®s beau et de belle qualit√© pour le prix. Arriver rapidement. Je recommande cette boutique.
Trop mignon! Merci!
"Heureuse de l'avoir re√ßu, il est tr√®s mignon"
Beautiful and unique earrings! Delivery was prompt and item is absolutely gorgeous.
"These earrings are just beautiful. They are just as pictured, exactly what I wanted. I am pleasantly surprised at the weight and quality. I will absolutely be ordering from this shop again!"
These earrings are absolutely adorable!!! I loved them and instantly put them in. I have not bought any earrings that climb your ear so I was nervous but they look great!!!
They look so beautiful! I love them. I'm so glad I got them! I'm in love üòç
Tr√®s jolies boucles! Ravie de ce cadeau! Merci.
"Parfait et super contente. Vite exp√©di√©es, les boucles correspondent √† la photo et sont tr√®s jolies. Merci beaucoup."
Boucles d'oreilles parfaites ! :) J'adore ! Merci
Tr√®s jolies boucles. Ni trop petites ni trop grandes. Parfaites donc. J'en suis tr√®s satisfaite. La livraison ultra rapide. Merci
These earrings are beautiful. Definitely one of my favorite pairs that I own now. They're practically weightless too and comfortable. Definitely recommend and worth the price üëå
"Gorgeous bracelet! Giving it to my sister in law who just had her second baby, and she will love! It‚Äôs super delicate and very pretty. Am planning to purchase another for a new mom of two soon! Shipped very quickly too!"
"I have such tiny fingers, size 5.5-6.5, and I was worried this would be too big. I was able to adjust it carefully to fit my middle finger and it looks so beautiful! I‚Äôm so excited! Super durable. Such a stunning piece!"
I can't find the defect but I am very grateful for the discount! This is super cute and has the extreme attention to detail I'm used to seeing from Yugen Handmade! My wrists are a bit chubby and this still fits. I get compliments every time I wear this! Will be back!!
elles sont splendides ! quel travail ! bravo. je recommande vraiment.
"Je suis tr√®s satisfait de ma commande, parvenue dans d'excellentes conditions d'emballage et de d√©lais. Merci"
elles sont tout simplement superbes !! pas d√©√ßue de mon achat. Article re√ßu rapidement et identique √† la photo (en mieux m√™me !!) un grand merci
"Joli collier, fid√®le √† la description. Les propri√©taires de la boutique ont r√©pondu rapidement et efficacement √† mes questions. Contente de mon achat !"
Kathleen from Macalania has to be one of the kindest shop managers on all of Etsy! I had experienced shipping delays due to COVID which was not her fault at all and she made sure to send out a second pair of earrings so that they would arrive in time for a gift. She consistently tracked and updated my order to make sure I felt reassured the entire time. Her generosity and kindness went above and beyond! The earrings are GORGEOUS they are delicate and shined to perfection and I love so much that they are a gold and silver color which will allow me to match with all my other jewelry. They are amazingly minimal and make the perfect gift for all your designer friends!! I cannot thank her enough for this beautiful gift and I cannot wait to buy from this shop again! Thank you thank you ‚ú®‚ú® And they were shipped with extra backings!
"placed my order on Thursday and received my order on Monday! and, oh my, am i pleased . . . pleased with the packaging and with the earrings! AND, she included extra backs with the earrings. i‚Äôve been looking for some ‚Äúevery day earrings‚Äù and i think these are going to work well. very versatile set. would not hesitate to order from Kathy again"
"These are stunning! So pretty. The seller is so nice! She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away. Amazing. I love the denim lapis. Beautiful color. Love that you can wear them several different ways. They're very comfortable, and easy to wear. They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect! I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service."
Suited my wedding dress perfectly.
"Beautifully packaged and lovely earrings, highly recommended!"
Gorgeous necklace and Amazing quality! Definitely would buy from here again!
"Absolutely gorgeous as is everything I have purchased. Wonderful detail in the jewellery, lovely packaging and prompt postage. Thank you as always for beautiful jewellery!! üòä"
Very cute!
"Holy cow I ADORE these earrings! Beautiful, understated, and came super fast. Pro tip you have to twist them in backwards (from the back of your piercing instead of the front) to get them to lay right--took me wayy to long to figure out but was super easy once I did!"
"I love these earrings! I wore them for prom and get soooo many compliments, they weren‚Äôt too heavy either!"
"These earrings are gorgeous! So much so, that the second I put them on, my partner told me that she was going to steal them."
I was super excited for these. I really love the look of black earrings and the designs were awesome. The paint on these earrings is coming off though so a little disappointed.
"OMG! I AM SO HAPPY with my most recent Lenti purchases! The earrings are beautiful. They are so light and have great movement. I am hooked (literally) I will be purchasing more Lenti earrings for myself and as gifts. The necklace is smaller than I thought, and the clasp is backward for me but I LOVE IT!! It is great to wear by itself, with the crescent moon earrings, and it also looks fabulous with my Kyanite necklace. The chain links make it very easy to adjust lengths. My picture shows the many ways I can wear my new jewelry. Thank you."
"My third purchase from the shop. Vasso makes jewelry that I just want to wear ALL THE TIME. These pearl stud earrings are timeless pieces that go with any outfit. They are simple yet intricate and sophisticated. You can tell they are excellent quality and made with meticulousness and care. In addition, Vasso is so lovely and easy to communicate with. I had a few questions and concerns along the way and Vasso was responsive and attentive. Shipping was super quick and somehow even faster than domestic shipping! Once again I couldn't have been happier with my purchase. Thank you, Vasso."
"Love these earrings! Great quality. They are dainty and delicate, but they also really stand out. Everything‚Äôs a 10/10 in my opinion!"
"Oh my GOODNESS!! This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! I received it much sooner than I anticipated, and it came in a beautiful box with a hand written note. Vasso, thank you so much! I adore this necklace. I‚Äôve never felt smooth kyanite before - when I find it where I live now, it‚Äôs rough and much lighter in color. These kyanite pieces are bold and smooth and quite powerful statements from nature. I‚Äôm so so proud to have this piece and will probably wear it every day. Also, it came with some beautiful herbs that decorated the inside of the package. Such a beautiful and lovely touch. I‚Äôm curious as to what they are! Buy this piece - you will be in awe!"
"Ravie de mon achat. Ravissantes BO, d√©licates et l√©g√®res. Un must have!! Livr√©es dans un joli pochon en tissu."
"Sehr entz√ºckende Ohrstecker! Ich habe schon lange nach passenden Perlenohrringen gesucht und hier nun endlich f√ºndig geworden. Mit den Katzen√∂hrchen perfekt, als w√§ren sie f√ºr mich designt. Ganz liebevoll verpackt :))) Ich bestelle gerne wieder!"
Livraison rapide. Vendeuse √† l'√©coute et tr√®s r√©active. Les BO re√ßues sont tr√®s jolies et conformes √† ce que j'attendais ! Merci :)
I ordered my fathers fingerprint necklace for my sister. Beautiful crafted and very satisfied. Very professional helpful staff went beyond my expectations and did extras such as engraving ‚ÄúI love you daddy‚Äù on the back with no additional cost. Delivery was super fast received it next from Greece! You guys are the best will be purchasing again from you. Thank you!
These are even prettier in real life!
Left it late for my girlfriends birthday present but they sorted it out really quickly with only a week turnaround! The product is really good quality and the engraving is superb! Got some handwriting in the inside and it looks just like the picture I send. No complaints whatsoever and they went above and beyond to get it here on time. Would highly recommend to anyone!
"I'm giving this item five stars because it is so beautifully made and my mom's handwriting is spot on. I gave it as a gift to myself and my sister. My only issue is that both of our chains broke! The chains are so delicate and lovely but not meant for consistent wear. Now we have to find chains we love just as much, but that are more durable. Still, it is a beautiful piece and we absolutely love them!"
"Superbes! Elles sont tr√®s bien faites, j'ai tr√®s h√¢te de les porter!!! Emballage super joli, livraison rapide, tr√®s bon service. Merci!!!"
Superbes boucles d'oreilles d'une excellente qualit√©. Un service hors pair! Je suis hyper satisfaite! Chapeau!
"Elles sont superbes et facile √† agencer avec n'importe quels v√™tements. Ma commande est arriv√©e en retard de quelques jours. Pour le reste, je suis tr√®s satisfaite ."
Je les adore. Avec le fermoir elles restent en place m√™me durant la nuit.
"Superbe ! Arriv√© depuis 3 jours √©videment ! Merci pour la r√©paration, pour le petit cadeau et pour vos superbes bijoux. A bient√¥t Sonia"
"Magnifiques ! Je suis vraiment ravie de cet achat. Les boucles d'oreilles ""Les lionnes"" sont originales, belles et l√©g√®res. Envoi rapide et excellente communication. Je recommande. Merci Annie !"
"Cest un cadeau gagn√© √† l'occasion du calendrier de l'avent qui m'a fait conna√Ætre cette jolie boutique et je ne regrette pas. Magnifique boucles d'oreilles cr√©√©es mains, √©tudi√©es jusqu'au moindre d√©tail...une perfection. J'en suis ravie ! C'est avec plaisir que je repasserais commande √† l'occasion"
"Superbes & originales boucles d'oreilles ! Je suis ravie de cet achat üëçüòä ! Je les ai re√ßues tr√®s vite üöÄ ! Merci beaucoup üôè !!! Amicalement ü•Ä, Val√©rie"
Gorgeous - exactly like in photo. But as previous reviewers have noted - the post is a little short. Would prefer a more secure feeling.
"I have bigger earlobes so whether or not an earring will accentuate that has always been my concern. These earring bars are the perfect size in terms of the length and the thickness, and I like that it's a round bar and not a square one. The back clasps are tight and secure and the posts are sterling silver, which are all great. To me they stand out amongst other Etsy bar earrings in all these features. What's worth noticing though is that the posts used here are slightly shorter and thicker than normally what you would see in stores (for example Claire's earrings). It has two dents at the end and only the second one fits my ear. Make sure you measure the earring posts you normally wear to avoid getting your ears squeezed and swollen!"
"Une loyale porteuse de boucles d'oreilles de longue date! Toujours satisfaite, le contact est toujours tr√®s cordial. MERCI!"
"Pulls a little pinker than expected but that‚Äôs how it is ordering jewelry online. Still very cute. Its a little hard to get the jacket secured on the post but they look great and are quality. Actually, editing and adding to the review a little later cause they tarnished so quickly, about a month or so later, without me even wearing them. I tried on once and decided they were for special occasions, but sitting in a separate jewelry box they tarnished and are now a super dark color. Almost a dirty penny. They don‚Äôt match any of my rose gold, so I can no longer use them."
"The earrings look beautiful. I had assumed they were made with a light cardboard covered in African print. In fact they are quite thick, strong and heavier than most earrings of this design. They are slightly too long for me: the bottom edge touches my shoulders. If you like big, bulk earrings you'll love these because as I say, they are beautiful. They just weren't quite what I was looking for."
"Vom Material und von den Farben bin ich total begeistert. Allerdings sind sie doch etwas gro√ü. Wer sich die Beschreibung durchliest, ist echt im Vorteil. Im Sommer werde ich sie aber auf jeden Fall tragen. Sie sind wundersch√∂n."
"J'ai re√ßu mon masque tr√®s rapidement et je suis ravie !!! Il est non seulement magnifique, mais aussi bien enveloppant et confortable. Le travail est soign√© et les finitions sont parfaites. Mille mercis !!"
Magnifiques ! Originales ! L√©g√®res ! Je les adore !
"Pas vraiment ce √† quoi que je m‚Äôattendais, boucles de couleurs diff√©rentes, l‚Äôune claire l‚Äôautre fonc√©e et cr√©oles plus petites que ce que je voulais ( apparement je n‚Äôai pas bien lu ... car on m‚Äôa signal√© que les dimensions √©taient notifi√©es )"
"Bonjour, Je comprends votre d√©ception m√™me si je pense que √ßa ne m√©rite pas une √©valuation √† 1 √©toile... D√®s r√©ception de votre r√©clamation, je vous ai propos√© le remboursement et l'√©change ( o√π vous auriez pu choisir la paire de cr√©oles en bois ) que vous avez refus√©... Je vous ai envoy√© un code promotionnel de -10% sur toute la boutique valable jusqu'√† la fin de l'ann√©e. Et effectivement les dimensions ( en mm ou en cm ) sont toujours pr√©cis√©es sur mes fiches produits pour √©viter ce genre de d√©convenues. Qu'aurais-je pu faire de plus?"
"Bague superbe ! Tr√®s agr√©able √† porter ! En plus, elle est juste √† mon doigt ! Un bijou tr√®s original ! C'est ma deuxi√®me commande dans cette boutique, tous les articles sont superbes, faits avec soins. Envoi rapide ! Je recommande cette belle boutique !"
"Tr√®s jolies boucles d‚Äôoreilles artisanales. Envoi rapide et soign√© avec de petites descriptions sympa des pierres, parfait! +++"
Premier achat sur Etsy ... et je suis tomb√©e sur la bonne boutique je crois :-) ... ravie ... re√ßu la commande ultra rapidement .... le produit est r√©ellement conforme aux photos .. ca fait plaisir tout est parfait merci encore et √† bient√¥t (ps : vous pouvez y aller les yeux ferm√©s)
These earrings are so special. I adore this seller and everything I've purchased. I cannot express just how delighted I am with all the jewellery. Happy customer!! üíïüíñ‚ù§üíôüíöüíõüß°
"BO ""bon oeil"" Les anneaux suppl√©mentaires ajout√©s leur conf√®rent un air encore plus boh√©mien... Que les pr√©dictions soient fiables ! Les astres n'ont plus qu'√† bien se tenir. Lol. Merci Muriel, elles sont super."
I have purchased many Frida creations from this amazing artist. Everything has been beautiful. I requested a custom made necklace to match her earrings and she included me in the process of the design. I am a loyal customer constantly checking her inventory. I love her work and remain a Frida Khalo fan for life.
I was ecstatic when I found these earrings on this site! I had bought this Frida Khalo T-shirt and was looking for earrings that would match; who knew that this genius would create the perfect earrings!!! Beautiful. Great quality!! I‚Äôm so happy!!
"Really cute and fast service but the earring itself isn't long enough to go in the ear. And with the back fastener, it looked even worse :( My ear was pulling up just to be able to hook it in. I don't have a big head either lol If they sold longer ones I think it would be perfect!"
I get so many compliments on this. It's both pretty and unusual. It took a couple days for my ear to adjust but now I'm comfortable wearing it all day. It's very easy to put on and take off.
AMAZING SHIPPING TIME! This is the second time I have ordered this anklet and I love it just the same. I‚Äôm very impressed with the quality of it standing up to my daily wear/showering! Totally would reccomend
I didn‚Äôt expect much because the photos of this anklet were so beautiful but it was better than I ever expected. Thank you for such gifted talent and high quality. Also it arrived in two days and in a gorgeous velvet jewelry bag. I‚Äôm so impressed. Will buy from them again.
I recieved this beautiful cowrie shell earring cuff. The photo doesn't do it justice. Some much so I purchased to more today. I love seeking unique jewelry. I highly recommend seller. It's worth the wait. Delivery is very satisfactory. Love my purchase.
These earrings are wonderful! Thank you. Only thing I wish my earlobes could be larger or the bridge between ear jacket shorter. Material is fine and the work is done perfect!
They are dainty and perfect! I love these!
I love the daintiness of these earrings! I've worn them almost everyday since I got them! ü•∞ 10 out of 10 would recommend!!
Absolutely love them. perfect size for the 2nd ear piercing. I only worn them for 2 days and have gotten a few compliments on them.
"Super dainty and cute. Perfect for my flats piercings. As someone with an intense nickel allergy, these don't irritate my ears, they're light and comfortable and very cute"
"I love this necklace! I purchased it for my mom for mother's day this year. We are taking a trip to Florida together, so when I found this necklace it was perfect. It's very heavy, and the chain is sturdy. I highly recommend it!"
exactly what i wanted! its my birthstone and could never find cute tiny ones like this! thank you!‚ò∫

My pyrite earrings arrived along with my stacking rings and I am so pleased. I love the look of the raw stone and they are surprisingly sparkly!
I'm really happy with my earrings. The hammered finish is discreet and catches the light beautifully. It took about a week for my order to be shipped out. I'm happy with that since it's a handmade item. The earrings have a diameter of 6mm. Love them!
"Absolutely beautiful and just what I was looking for :) They are incredibly dainty, and the letter on the heart ring is not too big, so it is still classy. I love the other 2 rings' hammered look, and the twisted detail on the heart ring is just a beautiful mix!"
I just got the ring it's beautiful it's so thin that I forget its on my hand. I love the floral pattern its so dainty and sweet. Thank you!

"The ring is fabulous!! It fits perfect. I ordered couple of times from them. I place my order right BEFORE the Pandemic outbreak. The seller sent a note inmediately, explaining the delays. It was all good. They sent the package as soon customs clear the way to do it. Really, really please with KINY SHOP. VERY RESPONSIBLE. I will purchase from them again. Thank you so much we"
I love the 2 necklaces and we received them promptly with a very nice message. We are so pleased!
"Tr√®s contente de mon achat, le dessous d'oreille est de tr√®s bonne qualit√© aussi bien dans la fabrication que le choix des perles. Et surtout le mod√®le est super beau port√©, parfaitement seyant √† mon oreille :). Envoi soign√© et s√©curis√©."

I ordered the 1 inch earrings and I didn‚Äôt realize that my earlobes were too small for that length. Rachelle was quick to answer my message about the issue and offered me an exchange after figuring out they weren‚Äôt the correct size. I am very happy with the .75 length earrings! They are great quality and I received the exchange very quickly. I would definitely purchase again from her because she was super sweet and helpful!
"Straight up, this is the first earring to not cause pain in my helix piercing. I immediately noticed how comfortable it was! It's amazing! After 20 years I've pretty much given up on keeping anything in it for more than a day... But now I can! The packaging was so cute and as a fellow Etsy shop owner, I appreciated the handwritten note. (I do that, too!) All around, I am 100% thrilled and will be buying MORE! Thank you, thank you!! ‚ù§"
"Rachelle applied all the finishing touches to make me excited and pleased before I even opened the box! The hand crafted, Swarovski crystal, teardrop, dangle, titanium earrings are beautiful. If there might be a downside-it is that the titanium ear wiring is very thin on the dangles. I say ‚Äúmight‚Äù because I have not worn them enough to see how well they hold up to normal wear. Rachelle even included a lovely pair of hypoallergenic plastic post NO nickel post earrings as a thank you gift. I am SUPER pleased with the earrings I ordered and the excellent customer service! I cannot wait to order again. Thank you Rachelle. 4.8 üåü Penny"
These earrings are perfect! I have very sensitive ears and can't wear most earrings. These are comfortable and don't cause any redness or itching. They shipped fast too! I'll definitely be ordering more!
Tr√®s joli .. tel que sur la photo merci beaucoup Cordialement Mari kali
Bien conforme √† la photo tr√®s joli Merci beaucoup Cordialement Mari kali
"The ring is so beautiful! I am so happy with it. Even tho I ordered the silver color I received the gold one. And let me tell I am not mad, it looks adorable with my other two rings. Plus the seller sent a sweet note and an extra gift. Thank you."
"I was in search of a solid pair of studs for my main lobe and wow, the shine off these were a pleasant surprise! They'll probably be my go-to for the main lobe"
"Very dainty and looks exactly like the photos :) Unfortunately it is too small for my first lobe (which I originally bought it for), but it should fit my second lobe once it heals. Came very well packaged with a cute gift box. Would definitely buy from this seller again!"
I bought the little bar stud mainly for my second lobe. Perfect size. Pretty happy with it :)

Boucles d'oreilles √©l√©gantes et lumineuses
"I absolutely love these earrings! I‚Äôve worn them many days and they are fabulous! They hang so nice and are a real attention getter. The bead work is perfection! They arrived so quickly, too! I‚Äôve since bought more. This seller is wonderful!"
"Boucles d'oreilles magnifiques, un service au top et une livraison des plus rapides ! Que demander de plus. Je suis ravie. Je recommande vivement cette boutique."
"This is a FANTASTIC shop! The earrings are A very fine ,dainty quality. I like the fact that they are very contemporary but not heavy looking or feling, and I can easily customize each piece with the colors to match my outfits. The artist will send you all the colors of the beads for you to select just the right colors! she has numerous colors in each color category so you can get exactly the right colo9r to match. the sercie and communication is great. One of the best vendors I have worked with at Etsy!!!! I highly rec-commend this Artist. :-) Leslie Richards /Interior Designer, Naples, Florida"
"The earrings look beautiful. I had assumed they were made with a light cardboard covered in African print. In fact they are quite thick, strong and heavier than most earrings of this design. They are slightly too long for me: the bottom edge touches my shoulders. If you like big, bulk earrings you'll love these because as I say, they are beautiful. They just weren't quite what I was looking for."
"Vom Material und von den Farben bin ich total begeistert. Allerdings sind sie doch etwas gro√ü. Wer sich die Beschreibung durchliest, ist echt im Vorteil. Im Sommer werde ich sie aber auf jeden Fall tragen. Sie sind wundersch√∂n."
Tr√®s heureuse d‚Äôajouter √† ma collection ces superbes boucles d‚Äôoreilles ‚ù§Ô∏è ! Merci elles font leur effet
"J'ai re√ßu mon masque tr√®s rapidement et je suis ravie !!! Il est non seulement magnifique, mais aussi bien enveloppant et confortable. Le travail est soign√© et les finitions sont parfaites. Mille mercis !!"

"Exp√©dition tr√®s rapide, joli emballage, en revanche un peu d√©√ßue pour les finitions (le papier d√©passe et un peu coll√© sur l'autre face de la boucle). Sinon le rendu y est !"
My friend loved them and is been wearing them all week! Thanks again!
I love the shape and color of these earings and how they are the perfect size. Thank you for beautiful earings and quick shipping!

"I just received the cuff earring. It‚Äôs dainty and beautiful! So pleased. Highly recommend. Working from home, so nice to get this package delivered today from Israel!"
Love my ring exactly what I wanted. Super fast work & shipping.
The necklace is beautiful! I received it in no time. Service was impeccable and just perfect. Best Xmas gift.
I really like these earrings but they are a little difficult to get the backs on--very tiny. But I am wearing them today!
Echt sehr sehr h√ºbsch üòç!
"Beautiful set, but they were bent upon arrival and somewhat difficult to put in my ears, as each earring is three tiny pieces. They also bend very easily when they're being handled. Overall very pretty but somewhat disappointed by the quality."
"Beautiful jewellery, great quality and shipped really quickl. The colours in the picture were almost exactly as they were in real life and matched my wedding dress and colour theme perfectly! Would definitely buy from here again and recommend to friends and family :-)"
Absolutely beautiful! I am so glad I have found the perfect earrings.
Beautiful earring set! High quality. Seller was very helpful and worked with me when I had an issue. Can't wait to wear them out!
These are absolutely stunning!
Love it. Thanks.
Tr√®s beau et de belle qualit√© pour le prix. Arriver rapidement. Je recommande cette boutique.

"Heureuse de l'avoir re√ßu, il est tr√®s mignon"
Adorable earrings!
"My new beautiful earrings came fast and are so much more then I thought. Then pictures of them are true to the earring, but in person really nice. I really love them.. Made very nice and design is beautiful, comes in a nice bag and information on the business. Will definitely order from here again. Highly recommend!"
Love the size of them and detail.
These are SO beautiful and sophisticated that I‚Äôm definitely going to be buying a pair for myself. I can‚Äôt wait to give them away for Christmas!!
Beautiful! Purchased for a gift and now I would like to purchase some for myself. Jill
"I'm very late to this review, but holy cow, how stunning! I immediately fell in love. The opal changes color depending on the light. The silver chain is nice and sturdy. And the bag it came in was really cute!! 10/10 !!!"
"I absolutely love this little elephant necklace, it was going to be a present...but nah,I am keeping this one!:) Perfect seller's communication - I asked for a shorter chain, and thankfully she had one in stock and swapped for me. Highly recommended!"
Great little earrings. Lovely and sparkly.
The picture did not do this piece justice. It is one of my favorite things to wear!

"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
Beautiful beyond words! The pictures do no justice. The detail is amazing and the red opal is stunning! The entire nose screw is made very well and I highly recommend this shop! Shipping was fast and I received my nose studs almost 2 weeks sooner than expected. The nose studs came in a very cute jewelry box and the entire thing was well packaged. Thank you to TitaniumFashion for creating beautiful products and for the amazing customer service! I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again.
"These earrings are just what I was looking for! They are dainty and unique, perfect for my everyday wear. Thanks Kate for great communication and lovely packaging! I'm impressed. :)"
I love them! Absolutely perfect üòç
These earrings are gorgeous! I put them on as soon as I received them. They are so comfortable to wear and look so cool. The earrings were securely packaged and arrived quickly. Also included was a cleaning cloth and lovely note. I will definitely be back! Thank you Kate.
"Earrings are super cute just as described, I love the design with those little hearts. Just gorgeous!!!!"
Great customer service. Violeta was quick to answer my questions and concerns. Shipping was extremely fast and I received my earrings sooner than what I had expected. This pair of earrings were perfect! Just as described and super comfortable.
These earrings are so cute!!I will def. Be buying more from this shop!
"These earrings are beautiful! I am so glad that I chose these. They are simply and elegant, and super unique."
"I bought three pairs of earring from this shop and I immediately fell IN LOVE with each and every pair!! I can‚Äôt decide which one I want to wear as they are all so unique and fit my style perfectly. I highly recommend . . Great quality, fast shipping and packaged like it‚Äôs your birthday"

I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!
"I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!"
These ear crawlers are so beautiful and really comfortable! I like them so much I ordered more pairs in different colors! Communication was great and shipping was fast. They also were packaged nicely. I can't say enough good things!
"Absolutely LOVE my new earrings! They are great quality, look amazing on, and have a message that reminds me to be more mindful. Win win!"
"Love these earrings so much! It's like 2 pairs in one. If you just want to wear the studs, fine. If you want to add the larger, hollow triangles, excellent! I've found that I can even wear the larger ones in two different locations too (thread the stud post through the tiny hole OR through the triangle itself). Aaaand sometimes I even add the hollow triangles to totally different studs. So love the mix n' match capabilities!"
I absolutely love these earrings. Seriously I get compliments a few times a week on the triangle ones. I love an active lifestyle and these are perfect to give me an edge look and style. I initially wanted the stick ones and bought the triangles on a whim. I haven‚Äôt taken them off! Love that I was able to shop local and will definitely be ordering more from this shop ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"These earrings are awesome! They can be worn 2 different ways, either 1 side on top of the earlobe and the other side behind the earlobe or both pieces together on the front of the earlobe. They are delicate and elegant! The transaction was quick and very easy. Thank you very much!!"
I love these earrings. Currently my favorite and I get tons of compliments. I'm letting everyone know where I got them! Thank you so much.
Wore this with my wedding dress. Loved it only thing the bottom hole option did not work.
"I was really pleased with these earrings, they are very elegant and eye-catching, and the emeralds are a good size. Thank you very much."
Love my birthstone threader earrings!
Super cute!!! No complaints!

"I was a bit afraid of sizing because i didnt really know my size but its totally adjustable! Just as the picture tho, its lovely. And it came with a pair of earrings too! Totally wasnt expecting that. They are simple but so cute, and they dont irritate my ears at all. Will be buying again for sure :)"
Love it but wish I had ordered the 10mm instead of 12mm for my orbital conch. This is a new piercing so I just wasn‚Äôt sure on what size to order. The hoop is beautiful though and since I ordered 2 different hoops they sent me some cute pearl earrings for free! Very happy with this shop and the quality of jewerly! :)
These are my favorite threader earrings! I used to have another pair and I would wear them literally everywhere and the color never faded. I ordered a new pair because I lost the other ones. 10/10 def buy!
Livraison rapide. Tr√®s joli snood que j‚Äôai achet√© pour ma fille. H√¢te qu‚Äôelle le porte cet hiver. Je recommande !
"Beautiful scarf. This seller has a wonderful eye for which material to match with the liberty print. I have bought 3 for gifts (1 for myself!) and they are packaged beautifully, arriving promptly from Brittany. Thank you!"
"J'en suis √† ma troisi√®me √©charpe. J'en ai offert deux, et gard√© une pour moi-m√™me ! Tellement jolies, douces et originales !!! Merci infiniment."

"I enjoy my new Septum very much. The size/ adjusting it to my nose and looks are just perfect. It arrived very fast and with a sweet handwritten note to it. Thank you very much :) Uh, and I love the little box the septum was delivered in, perfect for storing it!"
"Schlichter, dezenter Ring! Sehr gute Qualit√§t! Bis her hatte ich immer welche die schnell vom auf und zu biegen verbogen waren, dieser macht nicht den Eindruck und liegt dadurch auch sehr sch√∂n an.... Absolut empfehlenswert!!üíúüçÄ"
I just loved the earrings!
"Da ich mein erstes Fake Septum aus diesem Shop leider verlegt habe, habe ich mir das gleiche ein zweites Mal gekauft. Es ist so wundersch√∂n und mittlerweile fester Bestandteil vieler meiner Tage, darauf wollte ich nicht verzichten. Tats√§chlich w√ºrde ich auch noch weitere Male hier bestellen und auch neue Sachen kaufen, da die Produkte super sch√∂n sind, von guter Qualit√§t und bei beiden Bestellungen eine liebe handgeschriebene Nachricht dabei lag. Da freu ich mich direkt doppelt √ºber meine Bestellung! <3"

Excellent products!!! Unique creations!!! Shipment on time
Stunning workmanship! You‚Äôre truly gifted!
"OMG! I AM SO HAPPY with my most recent Lenti purchases! The earrings are beautiful. They are so light and have great movement. I am hooked (literally) I will be purchasing more Lenti earrings for myself and as gifts. The necklace is smaller than I thought, and the clasp is backward for me but I LOVE IT!! It is great to wear by itself, with the crescent moon earrings, and it also looks fabulous with my Kyanite necklace. The chain links make it very easy to adjust lengths. My picture shows the many ways I can wear my new jewelry. Thank you."
"Love these earrings! Great quality. They are dainty and delicate, but they also really stand out. Everything‚Äôs a 10/10 in my opinion!"
"BO ""bon oeil"" Les anneaux suppl√©mentaires ajout√©s leur conf√®rent un air encore plus boh√©mien... Que les pr√©dictions soient fiables ! Les astres n'ont plus qu'√† bien se tenir. Lol. Merci Muriel, elles sont super."
"I love my hummingbird earrings! They arrived very quickly, especially considering they were shipped from France to the US. They are well crafted and the retro look is timeless. Our family has an affinity for hummingbirds. It is my eternal connection with my Mother because hummingbirds are a symbol of love, joy, good luck and healing. I will wear and cherish them always. Thank you SonAltessePtipois for carrying such lovely merchandise!"
Elles sont superbes! √âl√©gantes et l√©g√®res. L‚Äôassociation des couleurs est bien pens√©e. Muriel a beaucoup de go√ªt pour associer les couleurs et les formes. Je guette les nouveaut√©s !
I am in love with every set of Frida earrings I've purchased and these are no exception! So beautiful and so well made! Cannot rate highly enough! Delighted as always. Thank you ‚ù§

Love my ring exactly what I wanted. Super fast work & shipping.
The necklace is beautiful! I received it in no time. Service was impeccable and just perfect. Best Xmas gift.
Article bien re√ßu! Tr√®s tr√®s belles couleurs. Le ruban est pli√© en deux et mesure environ 4 √† 8 cm de large une fois √† plat! Si vous le d√©coupez en bandes de 2 cm de large cela le rend donc 2 √† 4 fois moins cher qu'ailleurs √† qualit√© √©gale !!! De plus le cr√©ateur est tr√®s r√©actif pour r√©pondre aux messages! Je recommande vraiment ce produit.üëç
Hi! I m from India. I want this type of doll since long time. But i couldn't find it. Finally i found out this website. I got so happy. And about the product its same as it's description.
"Bracelet is lovely. Vincent worked with me and resent it when I said it never came to my house. Yes, it took almost two months to receive this skull bracelet, but the wait makes me treasure it all the more."
"Envoi soign√© et tres rapide. Le collier est tres beau aussi, c'etait un cadeau et il a beaucoup pl√ª. Parfait merci üôÇ"
"They‚Äôre absolutely gorgeous, and came in a pretty green box with the other earrings I ordered. I‚Äôd definitely buy again! (They took forever to get here, but I attribute that to COVID.)"
"The earrings are so cute & dainty, BUT the back piece is even more dainty! It is so tiny (4mm) & I struggled trying to put them on. The needle of the earring kept bending & then it broke. I did not even get to wear it once. Do not buy it!"
The packaging is SO CUTE. Had to display the box in my room . Love the earrings!! Perfect little detail to all my outfits
Just what i wanted! Super cute! I was a little afraid that they would bee too big for my tiny ears but they are just the right size! The seller was very nice and helpful and made sure i got the order. Shipping took slightly longer because of corona. Seller also included a alcohol wipe to clean the earrings and 2 cute hair clips :) Will be ordering again
I love it. Exactly as described. I like that it's big enough to be noticeable :) Totally worth the wait!
Absolutely Outstanding Ring. Even more beautiful than shown. Excellent Seller. Thank You So Much!!
Very beautiful! I love it. With charming packaging. Quick service.
so lovely and comfy- even after wearing all day with mask. quickly arrived too...thanks thanks:)
"This necklace is so cute and dainty, it goes well with anything and looks great layered with other necklaces. I can‚Äôt speak much on how the rose quartz has affected me quite yet, but I heard that the closer it is to your heart the better so a necklace is perfect if you‚Äôre trying to focus on positivity and self love in your life."
"Second order, I am very happy with the jewels, very nice design, so cute! It even arrived so fast! Thank you Millie :)"
Les boucles d'oreille sont √©l√©gantes et l√©g√®res √† porter. Envoi super rapide et soign√© ! Merci !
"Magnifique boucle d'oreille, encore mieux qu'√† travers les photos ! L'envoi √©tait rapide, je les ai re√ßu deux jours apr√®s, le colis √©tait bien prot√©g√©. Superbe qualit√© de travail, je recommande !"
"Niets dan mooie woorden voor deze verkoper / artiest ! Een tijdje geleden heb ik dit hangertje besteld maar door heel het 'corona' gebeuren is het ergens onderweg verloren gegaan en nooit bij mij aangekomen. Geoffray heeft dan navraag gedaan bij de post ,maar tevergeefs. Maar, ook al trof hem geen schuld en was hij het niet verplicht, stelde hij toch voor ,om een gelijkaardig hangertje opnieuw op te sturen. Ditmaal met succes! Na een paar dagen had ik dit mooi exemplaar in mijn bezit. Ik ben er superblij mee ! Wat een service ! Niks dan lof voor deze man!"
"Des boucles superbes, un travail d'orf√®vre et un sens de la relation client comme on aimerait en voir plus souvent de nos jours. Premi√®re commande aupr√®s de Geoffray et s√ªrement pas la derni√®re au vu de son travail et de la qualit√© de ses objets. Merci beaucoup."

Love them! Beautiful little studs. All communications were efficient and perfect. Highly recommend.
ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§© so happy with my stacking ring
"I truly love this necklace! I was scared it would be too tight on me but it was actually longer than I expected. It has a beautiful chain, arrived in a storage-pouch, some care instructions and a bit of information about the crystal! It is a perfect everyday necklace for me! ‚ô°"

"Sch√∂ne Ohrringe und unglaublich guter Kundenservice! Antje hat die Bestellung auf meinen Wunsch hin kurzfristig ge√§ndert. Sie ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Lieferung kam sehr schnell, mit einem pers√∂nlichen Gru√ü versehen. Das war wirklich alles spitzenklasse! 1000 Dank!"

"Ich bin sehr zufrieden! Die Creole sind genauso, wie ich sie mir vorgestellt habe! Und der Kontakt mit Antje war sehr angenehm!"
"Every little piece is a masterpiece, love its delicate beauty! I wear them climbing up and hanging down :) sensitive skin friendly! Thank you!"
"These are now my favorite earrings. Original, earthy design. I -never- see conifer jewelry. Also, perfectly curved to follow the ear lobe. Beautiful!"
"They finally arrived and I love them, thank you! They took a long time to get here (NOT the seller‚Äôs fault - it was USPS and customs) but I am so happy with them :)"
These crawler earrings were wonderful and I love them.
"Boucles d'oreille parfaites ! El√©gantes, faciles √† mettre et - d√©tail pr√©cieux - tr√®s l√©g√®res, elles ont s√©duit d√©j√† deux membres de la famille (pour l'une en version quartz, avec un magnifique collier assorti, pour l'autre en version aventurine verte). Dans les deux cas il s'agissait de cadeaux et les bijoux ont √©t√© achemin√©s tr√®s rapidement. NB : mes filles ont aussi re√ßu en cadeau des bracelets tiss√©s jolis et solides : elles ne les quittent plus !"
"Un grand merci pour votre rapidit√©. J‚Äôai tout re√ßu hier, tout est parfait ! Il s‚Äôagit d‚Äôun cadeau pour ma femme d‚Äôici quelques semaines, mais je n‚Äôai pas r√©sist√© et j‚Äôai pu le d√©baller d√©licatement pour regarder, le bracelet est tr√®s beau et je suis certain qu‚Äôil lui plaira :) Encore un grand merci √† vous Passez une bonne ann√©e 2020. Benoit"

"The ring is absolutely beautiful. Such a dainty and lovely ring. The delivery was so much quicker than the expected time. It was wrapped and packed with care and full of thoughtfulness. It was not only safely wrapped but the packaging was so pretty, too - especially, I loved the gold star sellotape. It also came with a little nylon envelop to keep the ring safe. Thank you ever so much for the lovely ring. It is making me smile every time I see it."
Ma s≈ìur a re√ßu rapidement les jolies boucles. Merci pour le petit cadeau en plus ! Les boucles sont tr√®s mignonnes et originales !
"Article tr√®s sympa, au d√©but un peu de mal pour les accrocher mais on s'habitue vite. Je les ai re√ßue aussit√¥t (p√©riode de No√´l) avec en prime un gentil mot de la personne et un p'tit cadeau, vraiment cool!"

"Tr√®s jolies boucles d'oreilles, les citrons que j'ai command√© ont beaucoup plu et on a h√¢te de d√©couvrir les autres fruits :) La livraison a √©t√© tr√®s rapide √©galement"
I LOVE these!! I‚Äôm wearing them on my wedding day üòä
Item shipped fast. Looks exactly like the pictures. I ordered the smallest size chain and it‚Äôs the perfect size. Haven‚Äôt taken it off since I received it! It‚Äôs reasonably priced but doesn‚Äôt seem cheaply made at all.
"This is absolutely PERFECT! I love it so much! I was looking for a simple necklace, and this did the trick! I got the 16‚Äù. ¬∞O¬∞"
"The item came quickly and I loved it right away. It was a size too small so I messaged the seller, and they responded quickly and exchanged for the right size. The bracelet is beautiful - very delicate and comfortable to wear! I will definitely shop here again for jewelry in the future!"
"Really cute and fast service but the earring itself isn't long enough to go in the ear. And with the back fastener, it looked even worse :( My ear was pulling up just to be able to hook it in. I don't have a big head either lol If they sold longer ones I think it would be perfect!"
I get so many compliments on this. It's both pretty and unusual. It took a couple days for my ear to adjust but now I'm comfortable wearing it all day. It's very easy to put on and take off.
AMAZING SHIPPING TIME! This is the second time I have ordered this anklet and I love it just the same. I‚Äôm very impressed with the quality of it standing up to my daily wear/showering! Totally would reccomend
I didn‚Äôt expect much because the photos of this anklet were so beautiful but it was better than I ever expected. Thank you for such gifted talent and high quality. Also it arrived in two days and in a gorgeous velvet jewelry bag. I‚Äôm so impressed. Will buy from them again.
"Great, quality earrings! I have the .45‚Äù hoops in my first piercing, the .4‚Äù hoops in my second, and the CZ studs in my third (all from this shop.) I‚Äôve had them for over a month and they still look brand new with daily wear."

Loveee these everyday earrings!! At first the hoops were a bit too big but I adjusted them so they hug my ear
"Insanely fast shipping time - it‚Äôs like the seller lives out by my mailbox, just amazing! And the earrings are so lovely - I ordered my first pair just a few weeks ago and lost one of the backs, so I ordered a second pair immediately. Love them! I may get a third just so I have them forever. 11/10, highly recommend!"
Absolutely gorgeous. Love everything about these beautiful errings.
Absolutely beautiful earrings and ear jackets that are exactly what I expected. I am so pleased - thank you :) üôèüèª (I bought 2 pairs and am stoked with both)
Super cool and great quality! I've gotten so many compliments because they are so unique!
Love these so much! They are so unique and cute! Took foreverrrrr for them to arrive because of mail delays and Covid but I finally got them!!
Soooooo beautiful. Don‚Äôt hesitate to order. Can‚Äôt wait to order other items!! Great quality and super cute and unique!
Really nice and they look beautiful on. My only tiny gripe is that the posts bend super easily - which I suppose is to be expected from sterling silver.
"These earrings are so beautiful, edgy and unique, I was looking for them for so long and I finally found them!"
"The earrings are BEAUTIFUL and so dainty, I love them! I am overall very pleased with the shop and the item, I will be coming for sure for more in the near future!!"
"Exactly as pictured, fantastic quality, well worth the purchase. There was initially a mix up with my order and when I contacted the seller to inquire she had the issue corrected within minutes, no questions asked and without any cost to me. Overall a very pleasant experience. The customer service alone will make this shop a go to for me in the future. Thanks again! I look forward to browsing future collections."
These are beautiful! It is comfortable to wear and I receive such great compliment about them! Will definitely buy from this seller again! Shipping was right on time. Thank you so much!
"Very much my style, I loved them!!"
Such a great idea. Brings versatility to studs. Great quality very pretty
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"I love the these! I have been looking for jackets for my studs, and these are so fun!"
"BO ravissantes mais les attaches sont tr√®s fragiles, sans soute √† changer √† l‚Äôusage et je ne suis s√ªre que les pendants soient en argent , seules les attaches sont poin√ßonn√©es et pas forc√©ment d‚Äôorigine! Mais je ne regrette pas mon achat, les BO √©taient emball√©es avec soin dans un magnifique sac en tissu avec en cadeau une petite c√©ramique."
Envoi rapide et tr√®s soign√©. Articles conformes √† la description. Je recommande tr√®s vivement cette boutique. Tout est parfait ! Merci pour la gentille attention üòä
Je suis enchant√©e avec ma bague !! Elle est superbe !! Boutique s√©rieuse et livraison rapide. Je la recommande sans h√©siter !!!!!
"Jolie broche livr√©e dans un emballage tr√®s soign√©, merci pour la petite attention !"
C'est le 3 √®me prot√®ge carnet de sant√© que je commande √† V√©ronique et le r√©sultat est toujours parfait! Elle est tr√®s √† l'√©coute et conseille tr√®s bien. je recommande! Ils sont tellement beaux qu'on m'a demand√© d'√™tre la marraine √† chaque fois! Succ√®s garanti!
"Je suis enchant√©e par ma commande que j'ai r√©ceptionn√© ce jour. Un prot√®ge carnet super joli, de qualit√© et r√©alis√© avec go√ªt et finesse. Bravo pour le travail et son originalit√© quand aux d√©tails. Je ne manquerai pas de revenir vers vous pour d'autres commandes car je craque pour vos cr√©ations. Merci encore!"
C'est juste sublime ! La qualit√© du prot√®ge carnet de sant√© est incroyable... Tous les d√©tails sont parfaits. V√©ronique est une personne tr√®s a l'√©coute et disponible... Et patiente ! Je mettais un peu de temps a r√©pondre car je venais d'avoir mon fils et elle n'a jamais perdu patience avec moi. Je ne peux QUE recommander. üòç
J'adooore !!! Je suis juste fan du prot√®ge carnet de sant√©. C'est fait avec go√ªt et en plus V√©ronique l'a personnalis√© avec le pr√©nom de b√©b√© (merci beaucoup ^^ !). Et envoi super rapide üòâ
"I am in love with these earrings!!! I gave 5 stars for the shipping bc the shop sent it right away and especially during this time but quite frankly during any, how can the shop be accountable for how quickly u receive it. I had one question and she was very helpful & I start a new job on Monday and was hoping to receive these in time & did! They are by far the coolest pair of earrings!!! This is my 2nd purchase & I love how unique & well made the jewelry is! It is really just like the photo, I would take one but I truly don‚Äôt think it would do it any justice with my camera! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with these, they were by far worth the wait & I will definitely be ordering more jewelry in the near future! *Oh and they are comfortable, easy to put on, no adjusting, just put them in like normal! Perfect!!! üòçü§©"
"I bought one for my left as I have longer hair over my right ear. I like funky unusual earrings and this fits the bill. I love it. I just can't wait for lockdown to be lifted so I can show it off. Everything went well, with swift delivery. I look forward to finding some delightful jewellery off you in the near future, thank you xx"
"I ADORE the white topaz ear pins! I bought a pair instead of just the one. I wore them out to dinner last night and I was stopped by several people and asked about them. I have my ears pierced 15 times, so ear cuffs and crawlers dont really work for me. I will definitely be ordering some more similar items from this shop. Beautiful!"
"Breathtaking piece! so beautiful! I will definitely be ordering more! sturdy, sparkling and the perfect shade of rose gold. cute packaging also!"
"J'aime beaucoup ce que fait C√©line. J'ai command√© deux fois la m√™me paire, une pour moi, une pour offrir, et je ne suis pas d√©√ßue !!! Elles sont fines, √©l√©gantes et tr√®s franchement superbes. Par ailleurs, elles sont largement abordables et je vous recommande cet achat. Merci C√©line !"
Ganz toller Schmuck! Ein echter Hingucker und toll verarbeitet. ich freue mich schon ihn zu meiner Hochzeit zu tragen! Vielen Dank
"Cr√©atrice tr√®s s√©rieuse et super sympathique Exp√©dition ultra rapide et colis bien emball√© üëå. Pour parler de l'article en lui m√™me conforme √† la description bref une vendeuse comme on adore , Je la recommande a 100% Le top üòä"
"J'ai command√© ce bracelet pour l'offrir, √† No√´l. Pour cause covid, la cr√©atrice m'avait inform√©e qu'il n'arrivait pas √† temps et que je pouvais encore l'annuler. Rien n'y a fait, je voulais ce bijou et il est arriv√© en avance !!! Tout correspond et il pla√Æt beaucoup √† mon amie qui ne s'en s√©pare plus."
"So pretty!! They are very lightweight and beautifully made. I wore them for the 1st time today and got a compliment! Mich√®le sent them in lovely packaging, too üòç"
These earrings I gave to my mom. She just loves them. The blue cats are made so nicely and look so pretty. These match my moms new glasses purrrfectly üò∫. Thanks so much. Will be back to buy more in a couple of months. Take care and stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è
HI Everything arrived so well and it was such a joy to open and see your beautiful creative gems. I love everything and actually I am a collector so your cute note about having fun creating... done you have the final word ever! Thank you.
"Superbes boucles d'oreilles, ces chats sont magnifiques , j'adore !!! :) Bravo √† la fabuleuse cr√©atrice et merci beaucoup pour le cadeau !!! :) :) :)"
Magnifique!!! Des coloriages personnalis√©s pour les jeunes invit√©s du bapt√™me de mon fils. La communication √©tait AU top et l‚Äôexp√©dition de la commande rapide. Merci encore !

"Parfait, esp√©rons que le cadeau plaise √† l'ouverture :) Merci pour les feutres gliss√©s dans la commande :)"
"I love this earrings, they look like real mini cookies and they are even cuter than I though. The shipping was fast, they were carefully wrapped and came with a lovely handwritten message (thank you very much ü•∞). Just one thing, they are smaller than depicted. The description says they are L and W 1.8 cm but mine are a little less than 1.4 cm. Either way, they are lovely and look amazing üôÇ"
the photo is just one of them! i took it for drawing reference. i wear these earrings almost every time i leave my house!! they are my favorite!
"superbes boucles d'oreilles je les adore, colis arriv√© rapidement en tr√®s bon √©tat, merci pour le travail =)"
J‚Äôai eu un coup de coeur pour ces petites boucles trop mignonnes ! Je les porte tous les jours depuis que je les ai re√ßues ! Je recommande √† 1000% !

"I absolutely love my earrings! They fit my ears perfectly, and the detail and craftsmanship is exquisite! The Earrings reflect the beauty and delicate nature of the fern. Thank you so much, I am a very happy customer!"
I love these earrings! Very comfortable to wear. They're so pretty and dainty. This shop is amazing! Will definitely be buying from them again.
"I loved these when I saw them. I wanted something different but not too flamboyant (cause that's not really my style). Once I got the hang of putting them on my ears, they stayed comfortably and I would forget I even had them on."
Absolutely love them! So cute!
Beautifully made pearl ear climbers! Lovely pearls accompanied by a lovely note! Thank you!
"I purchased this bracelet and another style; all materials are delicately selected and perfectly made by the shop owner. The shape, size, and luster of those pearls are just about right. Tin-cup is my favorite pearl bracelet style all the time. I love the idea of using a beaded chain to connect pearls; it makes this tin-cup bracelet a stylish and aesthetic piece. LOVE IT!"
"From the product, to packaging, to shipping, to customer service, everything was perfect. Thank you so much! A few more words on this: I saw this style of earrings (safety pin with three pearls) on FLOTUS at inauguration and I fell in love. Had been looking for a similar and more affordable style until I found a pair from JustPearlfect. They look absolutely beautiful. I also have to mention the extra care the seller put into this product: the earrings arrived in a beautiful and unique gift box, wrapped with tissues and ribbons, with a cute little care card, and the sellers heartwarming, handwritten note. It brightened up my day! Indeed, it is during this pandemic that we need to support small businesses and help them survive and thrive. Your purchases made a difference for these businesses and their families."
"The bracelet is so beautiful, it looks even better in person! It looks dainty and delicate and just how I wanted. The owner was really nice and had answered all of my questions about sizing and shipping. For reference, my wrist size is about 14cm and I ordered size 5.5in. Overall, as my first order from Etsy, I am super impressed!"
"I received these earcuffs and love them! Nice fit, nice weight, nice color. I even forgot to take one off before I went to sleep and it stayed on all night, while being comfy enough I didn't even feel it was on."
The earrings are a Gem ! I really recommend them ! I am going to wear them for a wedding this weekend ! They look just like the picture ! ! Seller was very kind and always responded to my msgs! She also gave me a gift for the purchase ! I highly recommend the seller and her jewelry ! üëåüèª
I LOVE this bracelet (black). It‚Äôs so ‚Äúedgy‚Äù. I wear a lot of black and leather and this bracelet is perfect. And great for summer. Also the seller is very helpful and accommodating! Will be ordering more from this shop.
Perfetto! E la comunicazione con la venditrice √® stata rapida e gentilissima!
As always! Beautiful craftsmanship. My fav shop on etsy!
"I received my ring yesterday and I love it. I was advised by seller to upsize, which I did but I should've went up 1/2 more. But it fits! And I love it!"
"Absolutely gorgeous! This is my second purchase from this shop. I‚Äôd take a photo with the earrings on but I just recovered from Covid and I look terrible. Trust me, they are beautiful and bold. And not too heavy."
"These are totally cool in design! They are long and very artsy! I can hardly wait to wear them and feel totally vogue in them, LOL! LOVE them!"

I love these! They‚Äôre so delicate and unique. The small was the perfect size I was looking for to fit my upper lobe piercing. I‚Äôm not a fan of the plastic/rubber backings but I was able to easily replace it with a mental backing from another pair of earrings I had.
Loved them! Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
So so cool!

These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
This bracelet is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! The quality is far more superb than the picture. It glistens and sparkles constantly it's not dull at all. It fits my wrist and I was worried that it wouldn't because I have a fat wrist. It's not flimsy and it feels very sturdy like it won't break. All that I can say is thank you so much for this beautiful piece of jewelry. I definitely will be shopping again!
So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
"Shipped faster than expected. And it‚Äôs the perfect size! I haven‚Äôt taken it out since I got it. Seriously, my favorite for my rook."
"These earrings are just what I was looking for! They are dainty and unique, perfect for my everyday wear. Thanks Kate for great communication and lovely packaging! I'm impressed. :)"
These earrings are gorgeous! I put them on as soon as I received them. They are so comfortable to wear and look so cool. The earrings were securely packaged and arrived quickly. Also included was a cleaning cloth and lovely note. I will definitely be back! Thank you Kate.
"I love these so much, they are beautiful earrings!"
I love them! Absolutely perfect üòç
"Read the instructions or your earrings will not be secure! Once you do, your earrings aren't going anywhere! I'm so grateful I found these. I love going to thrift stores and finding unusual jewelry, but many times the backings aren't original or well fitting. These put my heavier statement earrings back into rotation --they passed the test and had my earrings secure for the whole day. I'll probably be using them from now on with all of my earrings because I feel so safe using them. So, so happy I bought these, thank you so much!"
Wow! merveilleuse invention! Je ne perd plus mes pr√©cieuses boucles d'oreille! Je vais le recommander √† toutes mes amies!
Exactly as shown.
Super handig en snel ontvangen!
"Quality is great! I got the rose gold and loved my pick, the picture is accurate! Love my new earrings üòÑüòÑüòÑ"
I‚Äôm super impressed with this product! Amazing artistry I will be buying another pair in gold!! So unique and different !
"I REALLY love this piece! It's smaller than I imagined (I totally did not read the dimensions lol), but it's the perfect size and the hooks are tall so they hold a lot of items. The brass is shinier and more new looking than in the photos. Definitely need to get a second one to match! Shipping was quick and the packaging was v cute :)"
"These earrings are absolutely amazing! They are light weight and stylish and I received many compliments while wearing them! I chose the silver hoops and I‚Äôm happy with the result as they match well with my red hair. I really like this quirky take on the classic hoop earrings, and these are going to be my go-to earrings for the foreseeable future! Thank you!"
I really love my new earrings. They turned out better then I expected. Thank you.
Love the specimens! Shipped fast and in very secure packaging. Unfortunately a lot of legs & antenna did break off but that‚Äôs a given since it‚Äôs dried and so delicate. Will definitely order again :)

"Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice! It‚Äôs beautiful, especially in the sunlight. Bigger than I thought it would be too. Very happy."
"I bought a pair, and am so glad that I indulged and got the real deal, they are stunning! A beautiful shape, sparkly and clearly real gold and stones, I feel like a million bucks wearing these. They're weightless on my ears so I can leave them on day and night, and they look gorgeous with the trio stud I also bought. Plus delivery was incredibly fast, two days from order to the UK! I'll be back...."
"Wonderful experience! I ordered on the 22 and received the earrings on the 24th! Super fast shipping! Beautiful earrings. I bought a pair. I‚Äôve had these in my cart for a while and finally purchased them. So glad I did. Super sparkly, unique and great quality. Thanks so much! :)"

Beautiful beyond words! The pictures do no justice. The detail is amazing and the red opal is stunning! The entire nose screw is made very well and I highly recommend this shop! Shipping was fast and I received my nose studs almost 2 weeks sooner than expected. The nose studs came in a very cute jewelry box and the entire thing was well packaged. Thank you to TitaniumFashion for creating beautiful products and for the amazing customer service! I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again.
I bought the beautiful ring from Nikki first and was so happy that I asked her to make me the bangle to match for my daughters 21st. I am delighted both with the result and the service offered. I gave Nikki a tight time frame and she hand delivered to make sure the bangle arrived in time for the party. Thanks again Nikki....love it!
"I love these earrings, so delicate and pretty. I‚Äôm excited to wear them out. I‚Äôd definitely recommend buying from Nikki. Only problem is choosing the piece they‚Äôre all so lovely."
Finally got them Nikki & I luv them. They are so light. Well done Cheers Kate
"We received the ring and are pleased with the quality, unfortunately we did not get it in time even though we paid for rush shipping. Ultimately, we should have ordered it sooner. A little disappointed with shipping, but we are happy with the ring nonetheless. Thank you!"

"I love my hummingbird earrings! They arrived very quickly, especially considering they were shipped from France to the US. They are well crafted and the retro look is timeless. Our family has an affinity for hummingbirds. It is my eternal connection with my Mother because hummingbirds are a symbol of love, joy, good luck and healing. I will wear and cherish them always. Thank you SonAltessePtipois for carrying such lovely merchandise!"
Elles sont superbes! √âl√©gantes et l√©g√®res. L‚Äôassociation des couleurs est bien pens√©e. Muriel a beaucoup de go√ªt pour associer les couleurs et les formes. Je guette les nouveaut√©s !

Love these climber earrings! Will purchase more. Great quality and shipped as promised. They actually stay put on my ears! lots of compliments!
I absolutely love my Paw Print Earrings! They are the perfect size and exactly what I wanted. I will definitely buy from this shop again and highly recommend it.
These are the perfect size for my ears!! I have trouble finding earrings that won‚Äôt clash with my plugs. These are great! They fit perfectly in between my plugs and my other earrings. And they are SO cute!!üíïüçÉ

"I love these earrings! I never would have picked 2 of the 3 earrings I received in this mystery pack, but I‚Äôm so glad I got them. I will definitely be buying again."
I can not believe how absolutely adorable these earrings are and the package from Kaylee made my day! You can tell so much care and love is put into the package and the product is great quality. I can‚Äôt wait to wear these and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get so many compliments on them.
got these for days I feel exceptionally chain. the sparkly paper they came in made them that much cooler.
"They‚Äôre beautiful. The posts are much longer than expected, but I love them"
Absolutely love these earrings. They are unique and handmade but really well-made. Thank you!
I love these earrings! I put them on the day they arrived ans haven‚Äôt taken them off since. Perfect for everyday wear. Thank you!
"The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think."
Netaly responded quickly with questions and assistance with my order.
Adorable and just as described! I wear as a stud on the flat of my ear and keep the other for backup! Love them to pieces! Came in a cute little box with sparklies too! ‚òÄÔ∏è
So cute! I have only worn them once since they were delivered and received compliments on them all day; purrrfect for cat ladies young and old! They also got to me super quick in New York from Israel :)
I really love these earrings! They‚Äôre super cute and the perfect size. I also have an allergy to nickel and some other metals and so far I haven‚Äôt had a reaction yet in my weeks of wearing them. The only down side is the backs they come with are plastic so I have to use the backs from a different pair of earrings to make sure they‚Äôre secure in my ear.
"Earings are amazing :)))) Super qulity and fast delivery. Thank you, Ohana :))))))"
"These earrings are really light and comfy to wear, plus their shapes are perfect, they suit me well for classy or boho looks. ¬°Much√≠ssimas para estas estrellas, puedo reconocer un trabajo de calidad!"
It's really perfect! I loved it!
"Todo perfecto, el producto solicitado, gran calidad, env√≠o a tiempo y bien empacado. Muchas gracias"
Gorgeous earrings. Beautifully wrapped with a hand written thank you note. Giving these as a gift but I might have to buy some for myself because they are so pretty. Picked these for the style but specially because they were made local to me in the Seattle area.
These are soo cute and good quality! They also arrived quickly :)
"Super cute earrings, one of my favorite now!"
"These are so adorable and great quality, and they arrived quickly!"
"Really cute and fast service but the earring itself isn't long enough to go in the ear. And with the back fastener, it looked even worse :( My ear was pulling up just to be able to hook it in. I don't have a big head either lol If they sold longer ones I think it would be perfect!"
I get so many compliments on this. It's both pretty and unusual. It took a couple days for my ear to adjust but now I'm comfortable wearing it all day. It's very easy to put on and take off.
AMAZING SHIPPING TIME! This is the second time I have ordered this anklet and I love it just the same. I‚Äôm very impressed with the quality of it standing up to my daily wear/showering! Totally would reccomend
I didn‚Äôt expect much because the photos of this anklet were so beautiful but it was better than I ever expected. Thank you for such gifted talent and high quality. Also it arrived in two days and in a gorgeous velvet jewelry bag. I‚Äôm so impressed. Will buy from them again.
These are my favourite so far. So classy!!
Merci beaucoup beau petit mod√®le
"Beautiful earrings, I love the flecks of gold!"
Parfait! Je la porte presque tous les jours.
LOVE this stack!!! Beautiful and thin and hasn‚Äôt tarnished yet
"Boucles d'oreilles tr√®s belles et vraiment scintillantes. L'envoi a √©t√© ponctuel. Je m'attendais √† ce qu'ils soient l√©g√®rement plus grands, mais je suis √©galement satisfait. Merci"
Une tr√®s belle paire de boucles d'oreilles. De tr√®s belle cr√©ations diff√©rent style et la vendeuse est adorable. Aller jeter un coup d ≈ìil dans sa boutique. Je la recommande vraiment
Merci je suis ravie de mon achat je les aaaadoresüòäüòäüòä
Really cute and unique. Love them!
This set is beautiful!! I got the right ear climber and the left as the standard earring. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!
"One of the jewel‚Äôs prongs weren‚Äôt closed, so that one got loose and I had to fix it. Definitely love my earrings though!!! They are perfect for my big day."
"These are so cool looking, I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!! They are a little on the heavy side so I probably will wear them only for the reception (not the ceremony) but they are going to look SO GOOD with my leather jacket! Just an FYI these are glamorous enough that you probably don‚Äôt need a necklace with them!"
gorgeous! looks great as a pair (one on each ear) and looks great with the crawler on one ear depending on the hairdo- very very happy with the purchase of both!!!!!!!
Tr√®s beau bracelet avec sa belle perle tahitienne !
"The pearls are just stunning - wonderful colour and shine. They are even more beautiful than expected. Contact was fine as well - Merci, C√©line"

I‚Äôm so happy w the way my earrings + ear climber turned out. They added the perfect amount of edge to my wedding look.
Hey! Watch! Rebeka made these customised earings to me! They are almost too gorgeous and certainly will catch everyones eye! Dream jewelry!! üëç‚ò∫Ô∏èüëå
"The earrings are exactly what I wanted. I needed amethyst ones which the seller was able to accommodate. I would 100% recommend jewelry from this seller. The earrings are beautiful, and I was also able to use the studs for my engagement pictures."
"Love these earrings. They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size. Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!"
"Tr√®s jolie bo, d√©licate et bien ex√©cut√©e. Plus petite que je l'imaginais mais plus fine aussi donc je suis ravie. Contact avec Charlotte-Anais tr√®s agr√©able et facile."
"Super mignon ! J'ai achet√© cette boucle d'oreille pour l'anniversaire de ma s≈ìur, elle est ravie !"
"Such a BEAUTIFUL earring cuff. A little smaller in person, but it‚Äôs so pretty it doesn‚Äôt matter. Shipped fast as well. Would definitely order again, thank you!"
"Tr√®s beau bijou, conforme √† la description et √† l'image. Envoi tr√®s rapide, je recommande !"

I love these! Beautiful and I wear them all the time. Great quality.
Came faster than I expected. Absolutely beautiful earrings. Colors are beautiful. I would order from them again and probably will!
"These are so cool! I love the colors and they look really neat ""climbing"" up my ears. (My fiance thought I had gotten 6 extra piercings to have ""so many earrings,"" lol.) I may need to start a collection of these..."
These are beautiful! Thank you so much!
"Great customer service, shipped more quickly than expected, and they‚Äôre beautiful."
So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
I had to switch these out for a different pair only because my ears are a bit smaller than average and it didn't sit right. Ilona to the rescue! She was so accommodating and allowed me to seamlessly exchange for a pair that perfectly compliment my headpiece and dress. Thank you soooo much!
"This ear climber is truly brilliant; the sparkle is superlative! Quality is sturdy, and it stays in place for hours without leaving my ear feeling sore as other cartilage clips and magnets have done. Shipping was fast and the earrings were spotless and nicely packaged; I'm so looking forward to wearing this climber to several upcoming occasions! Thank you Iloniti!"
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
"I LOVE THESE! They look elegant, simple, they are beautiful and made very well. They came as expected when I ordered them in a pretty box with instructions how to put them on. I recommend 10/10"
Stunning earrings! Very elegant and easy to put on. Will definitely be buying from this shop again! Love!
these are so beautiful omg
These earring are beautiful!! I have loved wearing them. They are prefect for wanting a statement earring that doesn‚Äôt get tangled with my face mask.
I went with the small brass ring and I'm glad I did because its pretty big. I love it!
Love these cuffs! They‚Äôre super durable and they fit so nicely. Beautiful gold color. Thank you!
These are so great! I have spent so much time cutting and shaping brass I cant wait to use these! They are beautiful Thanks
"I admire the flexibility and the look of these bracelets, they fit my tiny stick wrist which really benefits me allot, thank you."
So beautiful! Wore them on my wedding day!
I asked that a few champagne colored stones be added and the earrings turned out beautiful!
Beautiful!!!! Very well made!! Perfectly unique!! Got so many compliments on them!! The yellow gold turned out perfect. Shiny but not too yellow and complimented the stones so well. There was a shipping issue but she corrected it so fast and and was so helpful and kind!! No complaints!
I wore this for our elopement shoot and am so happy with my purchase! I love that the rose gold option so it would match my ring. I will definitely be re-wearing these again when we have our reception next year!
"These are gorgeous! The seller was very helpful and moved the position of the post for me. Shipping was very fast, and these came beautifully packaged in a jewelry box inside a velvet bag. Super happy with my purchases from this seller!"
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
I am so happy I went with this Etsy seller. I LOVE this ring. Had it checked to verify it is 10k and real moissanite. I can‚Äôt stop looking at it and will DEFINITELY be looking for Mother‚Äôs Day and Christmas! Thank you Harshita for answering my many questions also. I am very particular about stone size and having my rings be similar in thickness and width. Pictured is my new eternity bezel set 1.24 ctw in moissanite next to my 2 ct moissanite solitaire ‚ù§Ô∏è I love love love!!!!!

"tr√®s jolie de loin mais de pr√®s on voit que le produit est mal fini j'ai peut √™tre pas eu de chance, et j'ai eu un cadeau le cadeau avait de meilleures finitions."
"This is so much more beautiful in person. I‚Äôve had it a few weeks, worn all day and night, and it‚Äôs not gotten tangled or caught on anything and been so easy! I was initially worried it would be too short in length but it‚Äôs perfect. Doesn‚Äôt choke while trying to sleep and lays perfectly during the day."
Purchased the gold link bracelet and it by far exceeded my expectations! It looks great in the photos but in person it‚Äôs so much prettier. Love the minimalist style! I don‚Äôt wear much jewelry but this I‚Äôll keep on always :)
"Exactly what I wanted, and perfect for every day wear. I get so many compliments on it!"
The necklace is so beautiful and it sparkles so nice. I got so many compliments about it the first day I wore it out!
The set is TINY! Would not recommend.
Good product by a responsive vendor. Shipped on time and arrived quickly without any issues.
"Arrived fast, nice quality earrings, very unique style."
"These are so cute, gave them to a friend and she loved them!!"
"Beautiful piece of jewelry! It arrived much sooner than I expected and is great quality! The chain length is perfect, and the chime ball produces a beautiful sound. It's exactly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier with it!"
Elles sont top et vraiment belles ! Merci !
"Love love my dangle red earings. I purchased them as an after thought when buying a necklace (which I love too) anyway, it turns out that the earings are now one of my go to pieces of jewelry. I'm favoriting this shop."
"Merci beaucoup, je suis absolument ravie. J'avais un peu peur du tintement du grelot sans l'avoir entendu, mais celui ci est tr√®s doux et discret. Je recherchais un bolas avec des petites pierres et je suis enchant√©e d'avoir eu celui ci avec du lapi lazuli que j'affectionne particuli√®rement (par ses couleurs superbes et ses propri√©t√©s). La cr√©atrice √† r√©pondu tr√®s vite √† ma question et j'ai effectu√© mon achat dans la foul√©e. La taille est parfaite et en plus de cela r√©glable ! Rien √† dire, l'envoi est rapide et soign√©. Merci beaucoup Fran√ßoise, portez vous bien √©galement en cette p√©riode difficile."
Arriv√©es bien emball√©s et en parfait √©tat! Elles sont aussi belles que sur la photo je suis ravie de mon achat mercii!‚ò∫Ô∏è
Beautiful!
Elles sont super belles et agr√©ables √† porter !
"Awesome! Earrings are super high quality and a great priced, shipped fast too."
This is even prettier in person! I absolutely love it! The setting is so unique too! The Amethyst is a very pretty light shade of purple. It's very well made. And fast shipping too. I couldn't be happier with this purchase! Thanks so much!
"boucles tr√®s jolies, l√©g√®res et confortables √† porter, en plus quand on les secoue elles √©mettent un petit tintement tr√®s agr√©able, mais sans pour autant faire du bruit chaque fois qu'on bouge la t√™te donc c'est parfait :) Livraison irr√©prochable arriv√©e dans les d√©lais annonc√©, merci beaucoup :)"
"Vedic was really helpful in answering all my questions. I got my bracelet in a nice little gift box, a thank you card, and also a surprise gift, and above all the quality is great:)...can't be happier with a purchase! This seller definitely goes above and beyond for their customers and will buy again for sure!"
Simply amazing!!! The photos can't do justice to these earrings....they looked much beautiful in person. These were Christmas gifts so I choose the fast shipping option- and I got these in just 5 days from all the way from India to the United States. Will definitely buy again from this shop!
Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!
Love love LOVE this climber! Fits perfect in my upper cartilage piercing. Backing feels very secure (it does make the gauge of the post slightly larger than standard stud earring post). Super sparkly. Thank you!
"Communication was very good, as the shop owners kept me informed of the product progress via both Etsy messages and Whatsapp messages. However, I'm deducting 1 star, because one of the diamond melee has a very, very obvious window in its cut - it looks like a dull diamond with a ""hole"" in it, and isn't well-matched with the other diamond melee on the earring. On the overall, the earrings are delicate and pretty and the design is beautiful."
"These earrings are so beautiful and delicate and the diamond quality is incredible. I continue to add pieces from this designer to my collection for ALL of my piercings, including my cartilage helix piercing. I love that they also can make them for piercings - that is so rare and hard to find with real diamonds and high quality gold without overpaying for the name brand. These are just as if not more gorgeous as any of the high-end piercing brands out there, at between a quarter or half of the price. You will not be disappointed!!!"
"These earrings are just what I was looking for! They are dainty and unique, perfect for my everyday wear. Thanks Kate for great communication and lovely packaging! I'm impressed. :)"
These earrings are gorgeous! I put them on as soon as I received them. They are so comfortable to wear and look so cool. The earrings were securely packaged and arrived quickly. Also included was a cleaning cloth and lovely note. I will definitely be back! Thank you Kate.
"I love these so much, they are beautiful earrings!"
I love them! Absolutely perfect üòç
"Striking and a true bright gold color in person - the photos do not do these justice. Probably one of the most complimented earrings I own. Shipped fast, love the thoughtful packaging. Thank you! :)"
LOVE THEM!!!
Tr√®s jolis! Je les ai offert en cadeau et ce fut tr√®s appr√©ci√©!
"Love these! Arrived fast and in perfect condition, beautifully wrapped (I bought 4 items altogether). They don't irritate my very sensitive ears either. Highly recommend, and will definitely order again. Thank you!"
Great customer service. Violeta was quick to answer my questions and concerns. Shipping was extremely fast and I received my earrings sooner than what I had expected. This pair of earrings were perfect! Just as described and super comfortable.
These earrings are so cute!!I will def. Be buying more from this shop!
"These earrings are beautiful! I am so glad that I chose these. They are simply and elegant, and super unique."
"I bought three pairs of earring from this shop and I immediately fell IN LOVE with each and every pair!! I can‚Äôt decide which one I want to wear as they are all so unique and fit my style perfectly. I highly recommend . . Great quality, fast shipping and packaged like it‚Äôs your birthday"
I purchased the gold-plated marquise ear crawlers. They are gorgeous! Very high quality craftsmanship! I received them sooner than expected and in perfect condition. I have been wearing them all day and they are super comfortable (I forgot that I had them on) and attractive. Thank you so much!!
The earrings are so beautiful! I got them for my sister and she simply loved them! They came right on time and it was such an easy process when ordering. It was really sweet too because they even emailed me to ask if the time of arrival was ok since it was after Christmas. So a sweet and kind. Truly love ordering from Etsy! Definitely. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!
I love them!
They are sooo pretty! I was surprised with how quick I received them. Will definitely order from this shop again.
"I absolutely LOVED this nose ring. I got the 16g 9mm. Beautifully crafted, easy to put in, and shipped super quick! Unfortunately after a few days in, my nose started to get really sore, I realized the horizontal bar was just a smidge too short for my nose :( I‚Äôm still giving it 4 stars because it‚Äôs a perfect little piece of jewelry!"
"this is the third or fourth time i've order these earrings, i wear them every single day. only have had to reorder because of lost/broken (which are both my bad). the quality is amazing, the curve and length are *perfect* -- thanks renegade silver love you guys!!"
i love these earrings! i‚Äôve gotten many compliments for them. i love the oxidized black and their simplicity.
"I really love how these sit on my ears. They're a little too curved to stay in my ears for a long time, but they're great quality and great for short term wear!"
Parfait üëçüèª Le masque est tr√®s jolie... conforme au descriptif et de bonne qualit√©... j‚Äôai mis du temps √† en choisir un et je ne suis pas d√©√ßu de mon achat et de mon choix !! Merci
Encore plus beau en vrai!!! finitions au top ! en plus c'est Fabriqu√© √† Paris. Je recommande sans h√©siter
"vendeuse tr√®s sympathique et arrangeante, je recommande !"
"C'est beau, tr√®s bien fini, emball√© avec soin et m√™me arriv√© en avance! que dire de plus? Je recommande chaudement!"
"Just beautiful, a great design, so unique. Inspiring me to get some more studs to wear with them!"
I love these earring jackets so much that it is my third order. They dress up simple post earrings to dressy or casual. Really nice and they come in a timely manner.
Best thing ever. This jacket saved all my little earrings. Who ever came with this idea is a smartest person on earth and my personal hero. I‚Äôm 65 and my ear start to get bigger. ü•∫ thanks a lot.
"Very happy! I have been looking for almost a year for a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù that would allow me to wear pearls I inherited from my Grandmother. I have stretched lobes and wouldn‚Äôt change that, but do want to wear this pair of earrings on occasion. These jackets allow me get a good fit that won‚Äôt slip through. I bought a couple sizes and colors to mix up and pair on the front and back of my lobe to secure the pearl. So excited it works and will probably order more. Beautiful and functional!"
"ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! I‚Äôm so glad the necklace was on the longer side because I wanted it for layering. And the garnet earrings are perfect match. I was drawn to this particular piece because it has an important birthstone to me, and also because its design reminded me of a lotus flower. I will definitely purchase again. Just so incredibly well done,and whimsical too, which I love. Thank you! ü•∞üôèüèΩ"
Unique ear climbers; I love the rose quartz color. Probably the most interesting piece of jewelry I own! Flexible material that I was able to easily shape to my ear.
I love these earrings! I am very partial to long earrings with a lot of easy movement. These earrings ( which are very light for as long as they are!) move beautifully and the rose quartz is very eye catching :)
"Absolutely gorgeous, well-made/hand-made, high quality earrings. Unique design(s), beautiful craftsmanship; all are delicate/light enough for all day wear, yet pretty enough for evening. Perfect pairing where design accentuates function. One of my new favorite Etsy shops/artists! Purchased 3 earrings sets + necklace; over the moon about all! Packed well & fast shipping! Will purchase again! Thank-you!"
"Beautiful, and classy! These are so easy to wear because they feel weightless and go with everything. Thanks, Sam, for yet another addition to my collection of SDMarie jewelry!!"
"Love, LOVE the earrings! I get so many compliments every time I wear them!"
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
This bracelet is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! The quality is far more superb than the picture. It glistens and sparkles constantly it's not dull at all. It fits my wrist and I was worried that it wouldn't because I have a fat wrist. It's not flimsy and it feels very sturdy like it won't break. All that I can say is thank you so much for this beautiful piece of jewelry. I definitely will be shopping again!
So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
Beautiful beyond words! The pictures do no justice. The detail is amazing and the red opal is stunning! The entire nose screw is made very well and I highly recommend this shop! Shipping was fast and I received my nose studs almost 2 weeks sooner than expected. The nose studs came in a very cute jewelry box and the entire thing was well packaged. Thank you to TitaniumFashion for creating beautiful products and for the amazing customer service! I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again.
"These earrings are just what I was looking for! They are dainty and unique, perfect for my everyday wear. Thanks Kate for great communication and lovely packaging! I'm impressed. :)"
"I love these so much, they are beautiful earrings!"
These earrings are gorgeous! I put them on as soon as I received them. They are so comfortable to wear and look so cool. The earrings were securely packaged and arrived quickly. Also included was a cleaning cloth and lovely note. I will definitely be back! Thank you Kate.
I love them! Absolutely perfect üòç
"Absolutely beautiful!!! I purchased two bracelets and there is so much detail and quality in both items...looks much better in person... I gave both as gifts and they are definitely unique one-of-a-kind and a perfect addition. In addition, the customer service and response from the seller was fantastic!!!"
"Have purchased 2 sets of these, absolutely LOVE them! Perfect and great quality!"
"Love my anklet. Very well made and beautiful. Communication was fantastic and delivery was very fast! Thank you so much, will definitely order again x"
"La collana √® molto carina ed √® come in foto, ho apprezzato molto la cura per i dettagli anche nel pacchetto"
I am OBSESSED!!! I wanted a curved barbell for my rook but everything was too long and I did not like how it looked in my ear. But this!!! This is the perfect length and I can't get enough of it!
super cute! excited for my rook to heal to be able to wear this piece! i'd share a pic but the photos don't do the opal fire justice.
"Seller shipped fast, it was nicely packaged, and is really cute! However, it was much more yellow gold than rose gold. Luckily, you can't really tell because my ear covers most of the metal for this piercing. The little balls also do come unscrewed easily, so that is something to be aware of. Nonetheless, I would order from them again!"
"Perfect size and quality, slid into my piercing unlike the one I had ordered from Amazon that made my each super sore. This one has the stunning opal and doesn‚Äôt irritate my ear at all. I am very happy with my purchase and will be back!"
"The pieces are absolutely breath taking. The photograph doesn‚Äôt do them justice in the least bit. I am absolutely in love. As for communication, it was superb. He kept me updated throughout the entire process; from shipping to arrival. Also did a courtesy check to see if I had actually received the package sent. I look forward to purchasing many more pieces with time of course, the prices should be excepted considering the quality of pieces. Don‚Äôt hesitate üëåüèª"
Beautiful coins! Excellent communication with seller and was impressed with super fast shipping. Will definitely buy more!
My ring arrived very quickly and is just as pictured! It's beautiful and the seller was extremely helpful and responsive to my questions. Would absolutely buy from this seller again!
"Tout est bien, j'aime mes boucles d'oreilles, merci..."
Luscious in color and style! I can wear in several ways so I can wear everyday if I'd like. And I am thinking that I'll do just that!! Thank you for sharing your great talent with all of us! You are easy to LOVE!!!
"Given as a gift, ""Stunning"" was the word my daughter used to describe these beauties."
"Probably the prettiest pair of earrings i have, they look even better than the photo! Arrived on time, carefully wrapped! I am very satisfied with this purchase, would definately buy again!"
"These are fantastic earrings! Well made, even prettier than pictured and arrived on time. Thank you so much, I love them:-)"
The earrings were broken when i received them.
"The keychain looks great and I love the design for it! The seller was also amazing as although my keychain arrived broken, the seller sent me another head along with some extra surprises free of charge! I highly recommend this seller! will definitely be buying from here again!"
"You're now one of my top favourite sellers! Love your work, really wished there were more of this pin because i love it enough to get another one! The packaging was sooo cool thanks alot for the extra stuff you put into it (like the drawing from naruto and devilman). Another thing is impressively fast shipping! I hope you will continue to create a lot more work from here on out. I check your store very often for new items. Sadly i didnt make it in time to buy the wild child from bakemono no ko pin that u made.... Would be great if any of those items get relisted, but if not i will still look forward to buying from this store again. ‡¨ò(‡©≠ÀäÍí≥Àã)‡©≠‚úß"
"Je suis tr√®s satisfaite de cet achat, arriv√© avant No√´l c‚Äôest parfait!! Le colis √©tait tr√®s soign√©, je recommanderai ici les yeux ferm√©s ! Merci encore üå∏"
Pi√®ce originale et unique!! Beau travail!! Bonne qualit√©-prix!! Livraison rapide!! Je recommanderai!!
"Thank you, Savannah, it's beautiful!"
"The earrings are exactly as pictured except more sparkle! I initially ordered in gold but needed to exchange for silver to better match my dress and the seller was extremely kind and helpful with the process. For me, these earrings are a little edgy/modern while still classic making them really versatile. I absolutely love my earrings, thank you Dana!!"
I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!
"These are the most sparkly and beautiful earrings I have ever owned! I was worried about getting dangle earrings because sometimes they hurt. These ones are perfect! I'm allergic to most types of earrings and these don't hurt, I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! They absolutely perfect!!"
"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!"
"Envoi rapide, soign√©... RAS ! Je pensais √† la base que la fleur √©tait dans un ton ros√©, mais en fait elle est dans un ton ton gris (l‚Äô√©clairage sans doute). Elle est d√©licatement paillet√©e... finalement c'est une bonne surprise :-) D'autant plus qu'elle change de ce que j'avais d√©j√† en couleur. Je suis donc contente de mon achat ^^ Merci !"
"J'en poss√©dais d√©j√† une et je savais donc que c'√©tait super joli √† porter. Bon les couleurs ressemblent un peu √† ma premi√®re, je pensais qu'il y aurait eu plus de diff√©rences ! J'attends la cr√©ation du collier et des boucles d'oreilles !!!"
"J'ai achet√© deux broches fleurs (l'avis sera le m√™me pour les deux) afin d'habiller des vestes qui font un peu f√©es... elfes... et qui sont de couleur unique. Ce sera parfait ^^ En attendant qu'il fasse plus frais, elles iront √©galement tr√®s bien avec certains de mes v√™tements unis et qui sont dans le m√™me esprit. Vraiment contente. NB : et le+ --> envoi rapide et soign√© ! Merci"

"I got these for my best friend for her birthday and she LOVES them. She says they are super high quality. I like how they came in a super cute tiny gift box as well, and included a polishing cloth. They also shipped quickly. Thank you for a great purchase!"
These are super cute! Very happy with these.
"Love these cute earrings! Fast shipment, cute box & great price!"
"Absolutely LOVE it! It is one of my favorite ear cuffs. It‚Äôs simple, yet adds a little something. The quality is beautiful too."
Shipped relatively fast! The earrings were not as round as they look in the picture. They are more oval shaped. Other than that I really like mine and almost look like the ones I lost!
"I purchased the snake tragus cuff, 2 star cuffs, and a necklace and I'm very happy with each item. The Tragus is comfortable & fits securely. I found that the Star cuff is slightly bendable so you can adjust it to preference and wear it higher/lower along your ear. Based on price, the good quality and the timely manner it arrived, I would definitely buy from this shop again. Thank you!"
"Looks just like the photo, I love it and the shipping was fast, I‚Äôd definitely recommend both this shop and cuff. I will say that the first day I wore it, it was a little uncomfortable but all the times I wore it again after that it was for perfectly fine, maybe I got used to it or positioned it differently I‚Äôm not sure, but I‚Äôve had no problems since. Thanks so much!"
"I saw someone in IG wearing these on a reel and knew I had to have them!! I am so happy with them, they are beautiful! Exactly what I needed to complete my Mother‚Äôs Day outfit!! Thank you!! Yes"
I ordered them on Tuesday and they arrived on Friday! The first pair were hoops. I fell in love with them. So much that I purchased 2 paid of the teardrops. One for me and another for my best friend. Looking forward to new items. I will definitely be purchasing more!
I looove my beautiful earrings and can't wait to buy other styles!! I get a compliment on them everywhere I go!
"These earrings are amazing. So unique, so well made and were the perfect gift. Such a great price for such a well crafted earring. My niece already received so many compliments and want to know where they can get a pair"
"Super adorable illusion jacket. Would love this in rose gold. 10/10 would recommend, ESKITA delivered on this so well!"
They ever wrapped it with a bow! Very nice touch
Absolutely in love with these earrings!!
I love these they are simple and stand out equally at the same time!
"BO ""bon oeil"" Les anneaux suppl√©mentaires ajout√©s leur conf√®rent un air encore plus boh√©mien... Que les pr√©dictions soient fiables ! Les astres n'ont plus qu'√† bien se tenir. Lol. Merci Muriel, elles sont super."
"I love my hummingbird earrings! They arrived very quickly, especially considering they were shipped from France to the US. They are well crafted and the retro look is timeless. Our family has an affinity for hummingbirds. It is my eternal connection with my Mother because hummingbirds are a symbol of love, joy, good luck and healing. I will wear and cherish them always. Thank you SonAltessePtipois for carrying such lovely merchandise!"
Elles sont superbes! √âl√©gantes et l√©g√®res. L‚Äôassociation des couleurs est bien pens√©e. Muriel a beaucoup de go√ªt pour associer les couleurs et les formes. Je guette les nouveaut√©s !
I am in love with every set of Frida earrings I've purchased and these are no exception! So beautiful and so well made! Cannot rate highly enough! Delighted as always. Thank you ‚ù§
Tr√®s joli .. tel que sur la photo merci beaucoup Cordialement Mari kali
Bien conforme √† la photo tr√®s joli Merci beaucoup Cordialement Mari kali
Ma s≈ìur a re√ßu rapidement les jolies boucles. Merci pour le petit cadeau en plus ! Les boucles sont tr√®s mignonnes et originales !
Magnifique ! Je suis ravie de mon achat et la paire de boucles en cadeau m'a grandement faite plaisir !
Arriv√© tres rapidement. Emballage soign√© avec petit mot et joli cadeau. Les boucles d'oreilles sont tres jolies.
"Superbe broche, cadeau de No√´l qui va tr√®s s√ªrement ravir la personne √† qui elle est destin√©e. Gentille petite attention en plus dans la bo√Æte. Je suis tr√®s contente de mon achat. Merci beaucoup !"
I couldn‚Äôt be happier!! So unique and beautiful and I loved the packaging! Thank you very much
"I love my earrings SO much! They are incredibly well made and SO beautiful in person! I truly appreciated the owner‚Äôs kindness and flexibility to allow me to pick up local, she is awesome :) I also ordered another set of earrings from her website and I have to say, her stuff is super quality. As someone who wears their jewelry into the ground, both pairs of earrings have been durable and lightweight enough I hardly notice I‚Äôm wearing them at all. I love them, thank you!!"
I just received them today and I am soooooo happy with my purchase! It only took about a week to arrive. They are so beautiful and exactly my aesthetic. I will be wearing them daily and making future purchases üíõ
I love my open teardrops. I saw this style in a movie and had to have them. The dainty and hammered look are stunning üòç. Thank you so much!
"tr√®s jolies mais petites! pas tr√®s solides donc j'ai du renforcer √† la colle forte au niveau du ""fermoir"". La livraison est tr√®s rapide, l'emballage est parfait ! je recommande"
Le masque est tr√®s beau et le tissus magnifique. Le fait de pouvoir choisir l'√©paisseur les √©lastiques... est un r√©el plus! Et l'espace pour introduire un filtre est g√©nial. Un grand merci pour ce beau travail !
"Merci pour votre envoi tr√®s rapide, je suis tr√®s contente de mes achats, les boucles d'oreille sont tr√®s belles m√™me si un peu lourdes je les mettrai avec plaisir. Le bracelet est magnifique aussi. Conformes √† la photo, et m√™me plus beaux en vrai."
"Envoi tr√®s rapide, communication tr√®s agr√©able, et les boucles d'oreilles sont tr√®s jolies. Merci !"
"Gorgeous ear cuff! I saw this on the site and it was not in stock. Vivi was excellent in communicating with me and when she got it in, she let me know and I ordered it. So happy I waited to get it. Shipped quickly in a cute leopard box, is beautifully made with excellent little sparkly cz stones, sits snugly on my ear, and is simply quite an elegant little piece of jewelry. LOVE IT!!"
I'm incredibly thrilled with this ring! First time ordering with Zircon - this is my new go to for jewellery for exceptionally well crafted product with lustrous shine. I love bold rings with a realistic look and fee. This ring meets all my needs! Ordered a size 6 and fits very comfortably!
It is honestly a great ring. Nice quality and you can't beat the price. Although it didn't work out for me (my ring didn't fit well with it) I highly recommend this shop!
"This ring is so beautiful and gorgeous. I would highly recommend Vive, she was so sweet. I will order more jewelry for sure!"
"These are my second pair of earrings from SamiJewels, and I have been impressed with both sets I have. I have been getting more into ‚Äúear climbers‚Äù as the backs stay closer to my ear than traditional stud earring backs, making them more comfortable for me. The curve of the back of these makes this pair even more comfortable. The stones are so shiny, and catch the light beautifully. I chose the rose gold, which I have been very happy with as it is a little different and feels slightly more feminine than gold or silver. The quality paired with the price of these earrings have earned SamiJewels a return customer."
I am in love with these climber earrings! I only have one hole in each ear and these are just perfect!
"Shipped super fast and earrings absolutely sparkle. Didn't love the proportions of these climbers, as they feel a bit small especially when the first jewel of the climber is so large."
"Fast shipping and super pretty. My husband couldn‚Äôt believe the price, still doesn‚Äôt believe me that they were so inexpensive! Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Tr√®s belle cr√©ation! Super rendu mati√®res et coloris, qualit√© et l√©g√®ret√©. Livraison rapide, emballage soign√©, tout est parfait! Merci beaucoup =) +++"
Envoi tr√®s rapide. Emballage costaud. Une jolie petite bo√Æte est fournie! Les boucles d'oreilles sont juste magnifiques! Il n'y a pas √† dire: je suis fan et je recommande cette boutique!!
"tr√®s belles boucles, un super packaging. Merci"
Tr√®s joli bijou. Commande re√ßue tr√®s rapidement. Je recommande les yeux ferm√©s
"I wore my first purchase of this stunning climber every day since I bought it (a year ago!). When I stupidly lost it, I ordered exactly the same one again instantly - that's how much I loved it! It's so comfortable and so stylish. I have no intention of wearing anything else in my ear. :)"
"What can I say, other than how pleased I am? Ordering was easy, hassle-free, and the items arrived in perfect condition. I couldn't be more happy!"
Just love this climber! It‚Äôs beautiful and super stylish. Have had it for about a week now and have been wearing it every day as it‚Äôs very comfortable.
"I absolutely love this climber - it's such a cool, interesting design, and looks great on. Thanks!"
So stunning love the modern look
"Love these gorgeous earrings, thank you!"
"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle.

"Tr√®s joli bracelet, tout en finesse. L'emballage en lui-m√™me est un cadeau ! Cr√©atrice disponible et attentive. Merci !"
The earrings I bought are beautiful. The prices are very reasonable and the customer service and the packaging are exceptional! An excellent experience all around. I'll come back.
I love these earrings! They were delivered in a timely manner and the packaging was wonderful. You can tell she puts her Time and love into it and that makes it even better! Will definitely order from again soon!
Love these! I have a total of 7 earlobe piercings and this is perfect for something a little different. I wear ball studs in all the other piercings.
"The beads were a little bigger than expected and the posts are extra long. I thought it would be a bit dainty-er (maybe I just have a tiny ear lobe?). Otherwise, great quality and I haven‚Äôt had an issues with sensitivity or reactions to the earrings, which is fairly rare for me. The seller had super quick turnaround and I got these in record time"
Love this little earring. Shipped fast. Thank You
true love!!! eXtremely cool earrings ‚ô• sweet seller and fast shipping thank you ambica!!!
I'm incredibly thrilled with this ring! First time ordering with Zircon - this is my new go to for jewellery for exceptionally well crafted product with lustrous shine. I love bold rings with a realistic look and fee. This ring meets all my needs! Ordered a size 6 and fits very comfortably!
"Gorgeous ear cuff! I saw this on the site and it was not in stock. Vivi was excellent in communicating with me and when she got it in, she let me know and I ordered it. So happy I waited to get it. Shipped quickly in a cute leopard box, is beautifully made with excellent little sparkly cz stones, sits snugly on my ear, and is simply quite an elegant little piece of jewelry. LOVE IT!!"
"This ring is so beautiful and gorgeous. I would highly recommend Vive, she was so sweet. I will order more jewelry for sure!"
It is honestly a great ring. Nice quality and you can't beat the price. Although it didn't work out for me (my ring didn't fit well with it) I highly recommend this shop!
"We were looking everywhere for a classic and quality charm bracelet for our daughter. The oval and round link bracelet is perfect, and they customized the size to her wrist. The service was great and very quick responses. Would absolutely recommend and buy from here again!"
"Gorgeous!!! I‚Äôm so obsessed with these earrings! Needed something for my 2nd hole that‚Äôs a bit off center from the others and it was perfect. Great communication, fast production and shipping. Love love love."
"I wore this to my wedding and received more compliments on this than my dress. So pretty, loved wearing it, will definitely wear it again and again."
This ring is just perfect! It‚Äôs dainty and beautiful! I will def be ordering more for my friends. Thank you!!
These are my favourite so far. So classy!!
"Parfait, super belles."
"Beautiful earrings, I love the flecks of gold!"

"I had seen this beautiful jewellery in a stall in Amsterdam and came home disappointed I didn't purchase more jewels. Thankfully, Nynke was able to custom make me a ring just the way I wanted. She was so friendly and kept me up to date with how it was coming along and very helpful with purchasing it. I'll definitely be purchasing some more items in future and would recommend for someone to buy some as a treat for themselves or as a present. The opals stand out beautifully against the silver and gold tones. Thanks again Nynke!"
"These earrings are simply stunning. My mother loves hummingbirds and a dear memory from growing up is sitting out by our flowers staying very still while the hummingbirds came about and fed on them; she always knew what flowers they liked best and no matter where we lived, every season we‚Äôd have hummingbirds come around. So, when searching for a Mother‚Äôs Day gift, I stumbled upon these earrings. They arrived just in time and they are absolutely beautiful. It was a bonus that they were opal, my mother‚Äôs birthstone! They are crafted with such care and they sparkle and shine gorgeously. My mother put them on immediately and she LOVES them calling them ‚Äúthe PERFECT gift!‚Äù The size of the earrings are just right, you can really see the hummingbird detail. Craftsmanship is unmatched. Plus, Nynke was such a pleasant seller! Thank you!"
absolutely love my earrings! They are my favorite piece of jewelry that I own.
"absolutely stunning. high quality and excellent craftsmanship, with a beautiful stone! Hubby wanted to get me an opal bracelet for 14th anniversary, but didn't like what he found online (or was too expensive), so he asked for my help. We went to Etsy and found this perfect piece. It nests beautifully in the join of my wrist, but doesn't ""cut in"" or restrict movement when using my hand/wrist. A perfect gift at an excellent price! Thanks!"
Tr√®s fin et d√©licat merci
17-year old great niece loved them! Her first pair of climbers.
"My new favorite climber earrings! Unique, comfortable to wear, and perfect size. Great quality, not flimsy where you are afraid the will easily break!!"
I was looking for unique but simple silver earrings and these were it. It took a few days of adjusting them to get them comfortable but now they fit perfectly and are super cute. I get compliments on them all the time.
Beautiful!! Love‚ù§Ô∏è
Very beautiful and easy to wear! Thank you
I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
"First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered. My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning! High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for."
"I love the these! I have been looking for jackets for my studs, and these are so fun!"
This shop is top shelf. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love my earring jackets and I look forward to getting more Thank you Carl you are awesome üëèüèªüòÉ
I LOVE THESE!!! They are beautiful just as described will definitely buy again.
these are so cute and perfect !!!
"I love them, I did have to put a plastic piece in the back to hold it on my ears, since I have small ears."
Came in adorable packaging I loved it
"I was so afraid to order this pendant because I saw another one of these at another shop that when calculated out was approximately 1/16 (pinhead size)."" I was looking for a small pendant with turquoise but not that small. I found LaineBenthallDesigns and thought I'd give it a try. I received my pendant yesterday and it is SO BEAUTIFUL, JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND THE COLOR IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. It nestles right at the hollow of my neck just above two other necklaces. They don't compete with each other and I've already received complements. Oh, and I forgot to mention the quick delivery. Laine, THANK YOU, so very much for this piece. The only time I will remove it is to clean it!"
"I think these earrings are now the prettiest thing I own. I love them so much. Super fast delivery, too. Thank you so much, Laine!"
"I paired this with a Catbird NYC Sweet Nothing chain. It's the perfect mix of sparkle and understated. The size of the moonstone is small, which is exactly what I wanted. I'm in love with it; might buy an emerald one, too!"
Absolutely gorgeous ring!!! I‚Äôm in love!! Laine was amazing to work with and created exactly what I‚Äôd imagined!! Communication was always quick! Very professional and the craftsmanship is impeccable! Such a special ring and I can‚Äôt get enough of how beautiful it is!!! Thank you!! I will be ordering again!!!

"i have been wearing this nonstop since i received it -- and, unlike other ear climbers, it has not fallen out! i am really happy with it: minimalist, goes with everything, stays put, and looks great! took a little while to get it, but that was to be expected for a handmade earring, and the wait didn't exceed what the seller promised."
I love the pattern on it. So chic!
"These are exactly what I've been looking for. They are simple but sweet. I was born with tags on my ears and my earlobes flip up. I hate dangly earrings, and normal earrings show the backs just as much as the front, so these are that perfect solution. Will definitely order from SDMarie Jewelry again!"
"Beautiful, and classy! These are so easy to wear because they feel weightless and go with everything. Thanks, Sam, for yet another addition to my collection of SDMarie jewelry!!"

"I love this ring! It sits perfectly on my finger and there is no shortage of gold that would prevent it from doing so. My favorite thing about this ring which you can not see in the pictures, is that it's made so that you can see both sides of the coin. I could not have found a unique piece like this for such a great price anywhere else. Also, I can't forget to mention it's hand made so you can be sure your receiving a quality piece. Thanks again Kotinos!"
"This Ring is absolutely gorgeous in every way. My husband was over the moon to receive it this Christmas. This beautiful ring is almost an exact replica of a ring that my husband bought for his Mom 50 years ago and which has worn since her passing 12 years ago. He lost it doing yard work about a year ago just before WE married, so to say the least, he was heartbroken. We searched all over & even used a metal detector without any luck. I began a search to see if I could possibly find one to replace it as a small token and this was it. I paid for express shipping and was not disappointed. The price, the shipping, the great customer service and the ring is exceptional in every way. My husband was overjoyed and myself too. I never knew my husband's mum but I'm sure she was as special as that ring! Thank you Kotinos!!!"
"Atemberaubend sch√∂ne Ohrringe. Ich bin total begeistert! ü§© Tolle Verarbeitung und genau das, was ich gesucht habe. Aussen satiniert und mit diesem h√ºbschen, griechischen Muster. Innen gl√§nzend poliert. Sauber gearbeitete Verschl√ºsse. Sie sind leichtg√§ngig und schlie√üen gut. Dazu ein netter Kontakt üòç und megaschneller Versand. Hier schaue ich gerne mal wieder rein! üòä"
"Beautiful ring, really quick delivery. Haven't taken it off since it came. So lovely I ordered another ring and would recommend, top class jewellery."
These earrings are super cute and exactly what was pictured. They‚Äôre made from a high quality material and came in a cute burlap satchel that I can put all of my other earrings in. This seller is also very helpful and understanding as she responded in a timely manner to help me switch the shipping address after the order had already been placed.
Just got these and LOVE them! Beautifully done and love that you can wear them 2 different ways! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I love what I ordered from this shop!! I will say, because I'm in the US and it was coming from Australia, it took nearly a month and a half, which during this crazy time is totally expected. So aside from the waiting, it was SO WORTH IT!!! The quality of the jewelry is amazing. And I had asked to customize the length of the two pieces I ordered and every was accommodated so kindly. ABSOLUTELY ORDER FROM THIS SHOP!!!!! xx"
"So different from what you find in stores and beautifully constructed. They are my latest ""favorite"" pair of earrings and look for excuses to wear them. Purchased them to wear with other items from this shop so that I can matching options. Nice secure clasp and light weight make them fun to wear without fear of losing them. I highly recommend this shop for their unique designs."

"So happy I purchased these!!! I'd been in search for wedding earrings for a while and kept coming back to these. I finally purchased them, a little late so I had to express ship them but the seller was very friendly and helpful and the earrings are BEAUTIFUL. 10/10 recommend!"
"Th√© earings are very beautiful and Dana very Kind good service. Th√© only fact is to be carefull with custom device because i live In europe, i had to pay 30 euros more. Thank you for you good customer service."
These earrings are SO nice and so beautiful! I plan on wearing them on my wedding day.
gorgeous. made it just in time to USA. quality superb.
These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
I messaged her with a photo of my engagement ring and she was able to help me find a perfect pair of earrings for my wedding! I‚Äôm beyond thrilled!
This bracelet is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! The quality is far more superb than the picture. It glistens and sparkles constantly it's not dull at all. It fits my wrist and I was worried that it wouldn't because I have a fat wrist. It's not flimsy and it feels very sturdy like it won't break. All that I can say is thank you so much for this beautiful piece of jewelry. I definitely will be shopping again!
So gorgeous. Loved wearing these amazing earrings on my birthday üñ§
"The seller was able to completely customize my jewelry to how I wanted it, so it matched both my nostril jewelry and my Bridge. It turned out perfectly!"
Sooo tiny. Perfect size for lip labret!!! LIVE THIS JEWELRY. Hard to tell the color of the metal spheres because they're so tiny. I chose white opal and yellow Gold but it is difficult to see.
Beautifully made. Came in a beautiful little wooden box. I have just ordered another in a 18 gauge as I purchased this one and gauge is too thick for my piercing (my fault). Thank you.
Beautiful beyond words! The pictures do no justice. The detail is amazing and the red opal is stunning! The entire nose screw is made very well and I highly recommend this shop! Shipping was fast and I received my nose studs almost 2 weeks sooner than expected. The nose studs came in a very cute jewelry box and the entire thing was well packaged. Thank you to TitaniumFashion for creating beautiful products and for the amazing customer service! I will definitely be purchasing from this shop again.

This is my second pair of aspera earrings and I‚Äôm obsessed. I love minimalist jewelry and theirs is unique and beautiful. Thank you.
These are delicate and beautiful! They look tiny in the package but they do take up a good amount of space on the ear. Very modern and edgy. And comfortable! I will be buying more as gifts.
"I really love my earrings. They arrived quickly in eco-friendly packaging (love that). Also I have had another style of this earring and it fell out. However, this style is great, stays in place and it will not fall out. Overall a great product :) WIll shop at this store again soon."
"Just lovely. I wear them every day (and night, because they‚Äôre comfortable enough to sleep in). They‚Äôre the perfect basic minimalist staple!"
"Bel article, fid√®le √† sa description, argent ne s'oxydant pas facilement"
How cute are these lil guys!! Obsessed!
"These are SO cute! Purchased for my daughters who are 12 & 6 and although a little bigger than I expected on them, they are ADORABLE!! My girls love them and have not taken them out of their ears all week (which says a lot because both have very sensitive ears). Quality, fast shipping, and sweet owner. I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Exactly as pictures! I get compliment every time I wear them! Lightweight and they don‚Äôt jangle a ton so I forget I‚Äôm wearing them! (Chapstick pictured for scale)
These earrings are super cute! I love the mismatched look. The seller is very helpful and responded quickly to my questions!
Je suis ravie de ma commande les boucles d‚Äôoreilles sont magnifiques juste comme je recherchais üòçüíö La livraison a √©t√© rapide et des petits pr√©sents ajout√©s dans le colis ‚ú®üåà Merci üòä
"Envoi soign√© et rapide, elles sont superbes, je recommande cette cr√©atrice!"
"Ma lair de plutot bonne qualit√©, javais flasher sur ce pendule le mois dernier, jai eu un r√©el coup de c≈ìur sur sa beaut√©, je pense que je peu rester des heures √† ladmirer... envoie tr√®s tr√®s rapide je suis vraiment contente de mon achat, un grand merci !"
ce bracelet m aide beaucoup ! j ai commenc√© par le mettre 2 heures par jour ! puis en tirant mes mes cartes ! et une nuit sur 2 . de 3 heures de someil (gros probl√®me) depuis des ann√©es : je dors 8 heures et vraiment repos√©e ! merci de tout coeur Ginger !!
"Product received in a reasonable amount of time. Seller was cordial and let me know when they were likely to ship. Shipping and tracking information accurate. Product the size indicated with good detail. Despite the size they have a little noticeable weight which is often a good sign. Good quality, fits well, and sits better. I recommend this one!"
The items were amazing üëè. I love butterflies ü¶ãso it was just what I was looking for.
They are so pretty I absolutely love them can‚Äôt wait to wear them soon ü¶ã
"This ring is absolutely beautiful! Packaged professionally, and the shipping was extremely fast! Customer service was top notch, can‚Äôt say enough great things about this experience. I will definitely be purchasing more jewelry from this shop!"
I think these are my new favorites! Love them!
These earrings are absolutely beautiful! Shipping was unbelievably fast. I will definitely order again!
"Beautiful earrings that complete any look. The turquoise posts add that pop, silver lace detail including studs draws attention. Light on the ear and heavy on ear lobe. Received order quickly and completely satisfied."
Lovely!
"I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect! Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get them before the new year!"
"Just received these jackets. LOVE LOVE them. Beautiful. Feel bad as I kept asking the seller if they were returnable as it said on the site store credit if after 7 days & w shipping these days things take awhile. He assured me they were returnable. I was worried my diamond studs might not fit in opening but they do fit perfectly. They really look more than the $400 price. Thanx, will be wearing them all the time!!!!!!"
"Absolutely love my ring. However, we had him sized at few different jewelry stores before I had this ring made, and it still came in about a half a size or so too small. So now I have to send it back to them to be resized, which unfortunately includes a $15 shipping cost. The ring is lovely though. Definitely worth it. I was nervous buying a custom made ring off line, but it is beautiful."
"5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture.. Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle"
I love ear climbers and this one of my favourite in my collection as it‚Äôs really elegant and makes a statement at the same time.
"Mom loves it a lot! This such a cute and fashionable style, good for everyday wears. Great quality ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Love !!!! My 5th order!!! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Super cute and edgy! A cool on piece to add!
I got these as a present for a friend. Super cute! It's always nice to find more options in a metal we can wear. I feel like a lot of titanium earings are boring/repetitive. These are cute and creative! I wish all your styles came in titanium. Keep up the good work!
I really love these earrings!! They are absolutely beautiful and even nicer than pictured! They arrived quickly and nicely packaged with great care! Maria was very helpful when I asked her sth! I am very happy with my purchase!
"I absolutely love these earrings and wear them all the time. They are really well made and I'm so pleased that they don't react with my very sensitive ears. They are also really comfy, I could wear them all day and forget they are in! Also, I like the fact that one side are extra fancy and the other side are plain gold. It means that I can still wear them at work but dress them down a bit."
"While these earrings were delayed for a month with everything going on, Maria kept me up to date throughout. When they arrived, they were exactly what I wanted; very happy with purchase!"
"These earrings are just what I was looking for! They are dainty and unique, perfect for my everyday wear. Thanks Kate for great communication and lovely packaging! I'm impressed. :)"
"I love these so much, they are beautiful earrings!"
These earrings are gorgeous! I put them on as soon as I received them. They are so comfortable to wear and look so cool. The earrings were securely packaged and arrived quickly. Also included was a cleaning cloth and lovely note. I will definitely be back! Thank you Kate.
I love them! Absolutely perfect üòç
"Holy cow I ADORE these earrings! Beautiful, understated, and came super fast. Pro tip you have to twist them in backwards (from the back of your piercing instead of the front) to get them to lay right--took me wayy to long to figure out but was super easy once I did!"
"These earrings are gorgeous! So much so, that the second I put them on, my partner told me that she was going to steal them."
"I love these earrings! I wore them for prom and get soooo many compliments, they weren‚Äôt too heavy either!"
I was super excited for these. I really love the look of black earrings and the designs were awesome. The paint on these earrings is coming off though so a little disappointed.
"BO ""bon oeil"" Les anneaux suppl√©mentaires ajout√©s leur conf√®rent un air encore plus boh√©mien... Que les pr√©dictions soient fiables ! Les astres n'ont plus qu'√† bien se tenir. Lol. Merci Muriel, elles sont super."
Elles sont superbes! √âl√©gantes et l√©g√®res. L‚Äôassociation des couleurs est bien pens√©e. Muriel a beaucoup de go√ªt pour associer les couleurs et les formes. Je guette les nouveaut√©s !
I am in love with every set of Frida earrings I've purchased and these are no exception! So beautiful and so well made! Cannot rate highly enough! Delighted as always. Thank you ‚ù§

"Merci Camille pour ces superbes boucles d'oreilles ! Elles sont arriv√©es tr√®s rapidement, bien emball√©es dans une jolie pochette. Elles sont tr√®s belles et de bonne qualit√©. Je recommande compl√®tement !"

I purchased this ear climber to wear for my wedding. It arrived on time and it was the exactly the subtle touch of character that I was looking for. When it first arrived I had no problems putting the earring in. I slept with it for a night and woke up with a sore ear. I struggled putting it in when I was getting dressed on my wedding day but with the assistance of a bridesmaid it went in. I blame my wedding jitters for this. I'm still waiting to receive my wedding photos but I'm sure there is a perfect one of my friend helping me put this in. Dare I mention that I haven't taken it out since?! I have slept on it now for 6 nights and love waking up to my little wave. Thanks Melanie for being part of my big day!! Jules
I absolutely love this earring! And I love how I don‚Äôt have to try and screw in a ball to the back! So easy to put in! Can‚Äôt wait to buy more jewelry from this show!!
"this ear climber arrived very quickly, and was packaged in a sweet little box. i immediately put the earring in my ear, and i don't plan to take remove it any time soon! IT IS PERFECT for my cartilage piercing! i've slept in it -- with no problem whatsoever! ((you don't even notice it's there when your head hits the pillow. no earring post to jab the side of your head.)) it doesn't tangle in my long frizzy hair (like some other cartilage earrings have done in the past). even while shampooing in the shower, it stays ""put"". IT IS THE PERFECT CARTILAGE EARRING!! thank you for making this product! =^)"
"Just received my wave cartilage earring and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Exactly like the picture! It's so dainty and comfortable! I've been looking for something like this forever, so glad I found you! My Order came in less then a week and the packaging is adorable! Thank you so very much!!"
"
            Customer service was great. The necklace is even more beautiful in person. It's a Christmas present so I'm happy it came in time. Overall I'm extremely happy.

            These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!

            I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!

            I'm incredibly thrilled with this ring! First time ordering with Zircon - this is my new go to for jewellery for exceptionally well crafted product with lustrous shine.  I love bold rings with a realistic look and fee.  This ring meets all my needs!
Ordered a size 6 and fits very comfortably!

            Gorgeous ear cuff!  I saw this on the site and it was not in stock.  Vivi was excellent in communicating with me and when she got it in, she let me know and I ordered it.  So happy I waited to get it.  Shipped quickly in a cute leopard box, is beautifully made with excellent little sparkly cz stones, sits snugly on my ear, and is simply quite an elegant little piece of jewelry.  LOVE IT!!
        "

            This ring is so beautiful and gorgeous. I would highly recommend Vive, she was so sweet. I will order more jewelry for sure!

            It is honestly a great ring. Nice quality and you can't beat the price. Although it didn't work out for me (my ring didn't fit well with it) I highly recommend this shop!

            Love these! I have a total of 7 earlobe piercings and this is perfect for something a little different. I wear ball studs in all the other piercings.
        "
"
            The beads were a little bigger than expected and the posts are extra long. I thought it would be a bit dainty-er (maybe I just have a tiny ear lobe?). Otherwise, great quality and I haven‚Äôt had an issues with sensitivity or reactions to the earrings, which is fairly rare for me. The seller had super quick turnaround and I got these in record time

            We were looking everywhere for a classic and quality charm bracelet for our daughter. The oval and round link bracelet is perfect, and they customized the size to her wrist. The service was great and very quick responses. Would absolutely recommend and buy from here again!

            Gorgeous!!! I‚Äôm so obsessed with these earrings!  Needed something for my 2nd hole that‚Äôs a bit off center from the others and it was perfect.   Great communication, fast production and shipping.  Love love love.

            Gorgeous piece! Thank you!

            Arrived in a very timely manner! Absolutely gorgeous and well-made. There are so many boring ring holder necklaces, and I was thrilled to find these unique ones. Splurged for the rose gold, and it was worth it. I will say the video of how to use the ring was a little vague, so it took me a couple tries to figure it out. The holder portion is a little tight so it‚Äôs easy to feel like you‚Äôre doing  something wrong or going to damage your ring. But once I got it, it became a piece of cake!

            absolutely perfect! i ordered a while ago but was so worth the wait! the rings came perfectly how i wanted them and are so cute! eugene kept communication through the WHOLE process and replied within 24 hrs. it is so sentimental and they fit true to size.  highly recommend!

            The earrings are fantastic... but what really made my day was the handwritten note, beautiful packaging and extra gift included.  My Heavenly Atelier goes over and above!

            I love them, I did have to put a plastic piece in the back to hold it on my ears, since I have small ears.

        "

            I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.
        "
"
            First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered.  My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning!  High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for.
        "

            I love the these! I have been looking for jackets for my studs, and these are so fun!

            I was so afraid to order this pendant because I saw another one of these at another shop that when calculated out was approximately 1/16 (pinhead size).""  I was looking for a small pendant with turquoise but not that small. I found LaineBenthallDesigns and thought I'd give it a try. I received my pendant yesterday and it is SO BEAUTIFUL, JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND THE COLOR IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. It nestles right at the hollow of my neck just above two other necklaces. They don't compete with each other and I've already received complements. Oh, and I forgot to mention the quick delivery. Laine, THANK YOU, so very much for this piece. The only time I will remove it is to clean it!
        "
"
            I think these earrings are now the prettiest thing I own. I love them so much. Super fast delivery, too. Thank you so much, Laine!
        "

            I paired this with a Catbird NYC Sweet Nothing chain. It's the perfect mix of sparkle and understated. The size of the moonstone is small, which is exactly what I wanted. I'm in love with it; might buy an emerald one, too!
        "
"
            Absolutely gorgeous ring!!! I‚Äôm in love!! Laine was amazing to work with and created exactly what I‚Äôd imagined!! Communication was always quick! Very professional and the craftsmanship is impeccable! Such a special ring and I can‚Äôt get enough of how beautiful it is!!! Thank you!!  I will be ordering again!!!

            They look gorgeous! Small enough to use for work, yet edgy enough to go out. Love ‚Äòem! Bought them in two different tones.

            I would wear this pair of earrings all the time, all day long if it were solid gold. Got compliments all the time, very well made. Beautiful item! I love it!

            Product received in a reasonable amount of time. Seller was cordial and let me know when they were likely to ship. Shipping and tracking information accurate. Product the size indicated with good detail. Despite the size they have a little noticeable weight which is often a good sign. Good quality, fits well, and sits better. I recommend this one!

            These are delicate and beautiful! They look tiny in the package but they do take up a good amount of space on the ear. Very modern and edgy. And comfortable! I will be buying more as gifts.

            I really love my earrings. They arrived quickly in eco-friendly packaging (love that). Also I have had another style of this earring and it fell out. However, this style is great, stays in place and it will not fall out. Overall a great product :) WIll shop at this store again soon.
        "

            Just lovely. I wear them every day (and night, because they‚Äôre comfortable enough to sleep in). They‚Äôre the perfect basic minimalist staple!

            These are SO cute! Purchased for my daughters who are 12 & 6 and although a little bigger than I expected on them, they are ADORABLE!! My girls love them and have not taken them out of their ears all week (which says a lot because both have very sensitive ears). Quality, fast shipping, and sweet owner. I‚Äôll definitely be back!
        "

            Exactly as pictures! I get compliment every time I wear them! Lightweight and they don‚Äôt jangle a ton so I forget I‚Äôm wearing them! (Chapstick pictured for scale)

            Beautiful earrings that complete any look.  The turquoise posts add that pop, silver lace detail including studs draws attention.  Light on the ear and heavy on ear lobe.  Received order quickly and completely satisfied.

            I got these as a present for a friend. Super cute! It's always nice to find more options in a metal we can wear. I feel like a lot of titanium earings are boring/repetitive. These are cute and creative! I wish all your styles came in titanium. Keep up the good work!

"
            I absolutely love these earrings and wear them all the time. They are really well made and I'm so pleased that they don't react with my very sensitive ears. They are also really comfy, I could wear them all day and forget they are in! Also, I like the fact that one side are extra fancy and the other side are plain gold. It means that I can still wear them at work but dress them down a bit.
        "

            While these earrings were delayed for a month with everything going on, Maria kept me up to date throughout. When they arrived, they were exactly what I wanted; very happy with purchase!

Le cadeau a √©t√© appr√©ci√©.
Seul inconv√©nient: ces boucles ont tendance √† glisser et ne restent pas fig√©es sur l'oreille. Je conseille donc pour √©viter de les perdre, de placer un petit fermoir.

            Tr√®s tr√®s beau bracelet. Conforme √† la description et convient vraiment pour des petits poignets.
Mais quel dommage, article re√ßu plus de deux semaines apr√®s la commande et z√©ro communication de la part de la vendeuse malgr√© mes interrogations. 
Je comptais acheter d'autres bijoux (vu que je suis vraiment fan!) mais vu la premi√®re exp√©rience, je laisse tomber.

            i had a custom order. she and i talked a lot about what i wanted and she even took pics of everything so i could see before she sent it to me. she did everything perfectly. i am a happy camper to say the least. she is FANTASTIC. don't be afraid to ask for custom work, you can get anything that the artist can provide within reason..it works.

            Alors comment dire... J'ai flash√© sur ce sautoir ! Malheureusement √† la r√©ception je l'ai trouv√© bien trop court. J'ai longuement r√©fl√©chi, c'√©tait ma premi√®re commande chez Julie. Est-ce que je vais l'ennuyer avec mes probl√®mes de centim√®tres ou pas ? Je le conserve comme √ßa mais je ne le mettrai pas ? Et j'ai tent√© le coup ! Et Julie a r√©pondu √† toutes mes attentes. Elle m'a rallong√© la ""b√™te"" (c'est le nom d√©sormais de mon sautoir) et il est magnifique, pil poil ce que j'attendais. D'ailleurs je le porte aujourd'hui ! Alors mille mercis Julie, et conseil √† toutes vos futures clientes : allez y les yeux ferm√©s !

            Arrived so quickly and is in perfect condition. I used to have a similar romper to this in high school and I wore it to death. This one is almost exactly the same just with a different pattern! I am so so happy I snagged this before someone else did

            Looks good from far, but cheap closeup. I requested the stone to be change to red instead of blue, the seller agreed to it but wasn't done. The quality is cheap I thought will be better quality for the price I paid. The seller is good responding to your messages, and delivery was on the  time expected.

            Very sorry you didnt like the item, I mentioned that i cannot change color of the stone. The color of the stone is set as listed

            The climbers are even better than I thought. Very pleased with this order! Lightning fast shipping. Will order again!

            This style had the perfect style of gems and length I was looking for, and was a great value. The business was very communicative and considerate (Covid related delays).

            I love these climbers! I needed solid rose gold bc I wear them 24/7 and my previous plated gold climbers lost the gold. But I didn't want real diamonds in case I ever lost them. So these solid gold with CZ were the perfect combination.  Very comfortable and sparkly

            Well The 14k two tone gold Gucci was beautiful but the size 2.5 that I got it was hard to see the two-tone! But That‚Äôs just my opinion. This being my first gold necklace, an Denize was wonderful I contacted her and I exchanged it for a solid Gold color marina, 14k gold necklace length 18‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Also purchased a second necklace 14k solid tricolor gold Valentino, 22‚Äù and I love that one too, both from Denize.

            I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.

            First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered.  My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning!  High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for.

            I'm skeptical of buying over the internet, but this was worth every cent. The beads are stunning and beautifully wrapped. Depending on your screen, the beads may look more blue based, orange based, or neutral in tone. In person they are beautiful! Photos don't do it justice. The red color is difficult to describe. Highly recommend this store. And the extra gift is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. I wish I could give more stars. *Once the package is sent, another company has control. Please allow more time for the parcel to come to you.  Wherever you are in the world, please wait at least a month. These small businesses have no control over the postal industry.*

            I am SO picky with earrings. These exceeded my expectation. Finding a small hoop that I love, yet also stylish ‚Äî I simply didn‚Äôt think I could find one. These are the perfect small hoop. I am in love.

            The turquoise color of these beads are out of this world. Photos don‚Äôt do them justice! Can‚Äôt wait to gift these beauties to my sister in law!!

            I was really impressed with the speedy shipping. I immediately put this item on and it works fairly well but not as great as my expectations. I ordered the three piece one. The clasp came around to the side and it did tangle a bit but not near as tangled without it. I am still glad I bought it and would tell friends and family.

            The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think.

            I would love to review this item that I purchased on December 3, 2020 but still have not received as of December 17th.  This is not the fault of the seller but due to the overwhelming effect that COVID is having on the US Post Office.  I look forward to receiving the earrings eventually.

I wanted to update my review once I received the earrings.  As always, EarfashionByRoger does not disappoint.  The earrings were even prettier in person than in the picture. They were meant to be a Christmas gift but due to their late arrival due to post office issues, I will be forced to keep them for myself.  What a shame, right?  I  know I will be purchasing more in the future.

            These earrings are beautiful and shipped fast! These will be perfect for my wedding
        "

            OMG ! It took sooooooo long to get it ! It's not the fault of Demian, but I need to tell what happened : The comb travelled slowly through all Europe with all the Christmas parcels to finally get in France BUT somehow, for no reason it came back to Ukraine so Demian had to send it back to me and there it is ! Damn ! 
By the way Demian is very nice and we had a good communication all along this adventure each time one of us had some new informations.
I told you that so you don't have to worry about his professionalism !
And the comb itself is very well made, small enough to take it with you everywhere ! Will be perfect for my beard !
        "
"
            I love the finish of this comb and it‚Äôs apparent durability. I do wish the legs were a little longer. But other than that it‚Äôs great l!
        "
"
            I like the feel and length of the teeth on my scalp. Heat-treated titanium is beautiful; a great comb for my collection.

            Very nice little carabiners. The edges are not polished or rounded, which means that your rope won't slip once it's tightened. They're also small and light, so they're not cumbersome and could easily have a lot of other uses, with some imagination. The seller is super nice and sent mine very fast. Lovely service, definitely recommended!
        "

            I freaking LOVE these earrings!! The finish is lovely..and they're super comfy to wear too! Get some..you won't be disappointed :)

            Love these gold leaf ear climbers. They're beautifully made and affordable. They're relatively easy to hook into your ear. Took a while to be delivered - understandably as they came from Europe. Can't wait to wear them out.

            These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! The picture doesn't show just how fine and dainty they are. They're also fairly sturdy, so I'm not worried about their durability. They are a little tricky to wear. They kept sliding off of my ear until I realized that pulling the earring a little further through my piercing tightened the grip over my ear. I recommend buying these!
        "

            I'm not that into statement items, but these were to pretty to pass up!! I got the green version and I could not be any happier!! Love them! ps they're just like the photo!!

            The hook goes upward along the curve of the ear. Get used to that, and you're good :) I like these small but not ""dainty"" earrings. Sometimes, you just need serotonin. And when you can't make your own, store-bought is fine!

            What a beautiful delicate little earring! I‚Äôm so impressed not only with the earrings but the service from Mon Roma. I originally ordered the silver version of these earrings because the gold had sold out but the next day new batches of the turquoise and gold were available. The seller swapped my order with no issues and I‚Äôm so pleased as they‚Äôre so pretty. Even more delicate in real life and really suit me :)
        "

            The customer service was top notch! She has been great to communicate with and the earrings are just beautiful! They are a little smaller than I though but lovely craftsmanship! Turquoise is my absolute favorite and her jewelry is true art.

            The earrings are exactly as pictured except more sparkle! I initially ordered in gold but needed to exchange for silver to better match my dress and the seller was extremely kind and helpful with the process. For me, these earrings are a little edgy/modern while still classic making them really versatile. I absolutely love my earrings, thank you Dana!!
        "
"
            These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!

            I love this piece! It‚Äôs so cute! I will say that if you like leaving your jewelry in for long periods of time, you will need to like just go over the jewelry with like a cotton swab and something to clean it with. Gets kinda dirty fast for some reason! Will buy from this seller again. Lol I‚Äôm like super faded in the pic but it shows the jewelry so whatever lol

            I love these earrings! They are very well made, and look delicate and beautiful. I was worried about them falling off my ears, but they fit very well and stay on perfectly. I have been wearing them ever since they arrived.

            I ordered two sets of earrings and love them both! This open hoop is a little big for my ear but I just tilt it up and it works perfectly. I tried it in my first hole and ended up liking it better in my second.
        "
"
            I love these earrings! Very dainty and modern. I love pairing the dot and the triangle together. I do find they can rotate a bit after sleeping on them, but I've worn them for a couple of weeks now and I've had no issues with them falling out at all! They stay put well and they're very comfortable to wear. I also have very sensitive ears and I've had no irritation with these! Would absolutely recommend these and get them again.
        "
"
            These are beyond gorgeous and the perfect size! Now I don't have to take all of my earrings out every night before bed because my head isn't being stabbed by the standard posts. I'm in love and never going back!
        "
"
            So comfortable and adorable for everyday wear!  I was confused with how to order a pair, the seller was helpful and honest when I ordered two single hoops and refunded me for the overpayment.  If you want a pair, select 2 hoops; it doesn't mean it has two hoops, it means, you get a matching pair of single hoops!
        "
"
            I got the pair of these in silver and they are so cute! I‚Äôm really loving the fact that you don‚Äôt need a cartilage piercing for these. They were also packaged beautifully with a hand-written note from the seller. The snake ear cuff is also from here üòä
        "
"
            This ear cuff is SO stunning. I think it‚Äôs such a fun way to give your look a little more edge. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it out. I also appreciate that there‚Äôs a 925 stamp, it reassures me that my earring will stay beautiful! I also appreciated the lovely packaging and handwritten note from the seller.
        "
"
            I purchased these two pair of earrings and I 100% suggest you to buy them !
Look very expensive and are so lightweight and shine,adored them! 
The lady had put a handwritten note inside wich made my day !!
Thanks Victoria lots of love ‚ù§Ô∏è

            I bought these for my girlfriend's birthday and she loved them! She said they were so comfortable and even slept in them with no problems. They are super cute and are a nice alternative to just regular earrings.

            I like them and they look exactly as pictured. My ears are a bit different in shape I think so one of them doesn't fit as nicely as the other one.

            Great quality, fast shipping and beautiful product. Back jacket is a bit too thick for me or maybe my earlobe is too skinny but non the less wonderful jewelry!

            I liked this pair more than any other pair of earrings and when I finally received the pair I was disappointed. They are much smaller than the picture.

            I love this ear jacket and I couldn't wait to receive it. I have many style studs (casual to elegant) and I also love hoops! So.... when I saw this I had to have it! I decided to pair it with a pair of chain link earrings and love the look! It came on time.

            First time dealing with this vendor-liked what I saw on the web-site & ordered.  My SS jacket hoop earrings just arrived yesterday (Jan 7) & they are stunning!  High quality SS & I was able to put my recently deceased Mom‚Äôs diamond stud earrings into the opening of the jacket & they are stunning!! I will order again from the artist, Carl-ThankYou!! Packaging was gorgeous & not a long time for arrival. Excellent experience & got exactly what I was looking for.

            Looks good from far, but cheap closeup. I requested the stone to be change to red instead of blue, the seller agreed to it but wasn't done. The quality is cheap I thought will be better quality for the price I paid. The seller is good responding to your messages, and delivery was on the  time expected.

            Very sorry you didnt like the item, I mentioned that i cannot change color of the stone. The color of the stone is set as listed

            The necklace is beautiful, but it took an inordinate amount of time to arrive (purchased Apr 5, 2021, received May 11, 2021). I wouldn't have minded this so much if the shipping were free, but it was $9 :/

            My daughter has had 3 horrible experiences with getting her ears pierced. She absolutely cannot wear any type of pierced earring and her ear lobes are vey scared. She is absolutely thrilled with these earrings. They don‚Äôt look like ‚Äòfake‚Äô pierced or clip on earrings and the metal doesn‚Äôt irritate her at all. They are very comfortable and very cute. We could not be happier. Before her Senior photos she lost one in a dressing room and cried. I immediately got on Etsy and ordered her another pair and another single earring to go with the one she saved. The owner of the shop immediately responded and got the earring to us very fast. We are huge fans and will continue to buy jewelry from this shop. Thank you so much!!!!

            This is my third ring from Isabelle -- I loved my first two so much I thought I would buy the oxidized silver ring, even though I was a little unsure about it. It is actually my favorite! It is so beautiful in person -- subtle and stunning and goes with everything; a perfect everyday ring.
        "
"
            I adore this ring!  I have purchased numerous pieces from Isabelle at the One of A Kind Show and they have become staples in my ring collection. 
Her attention to detail and the quality of her pieces rival any big jeweller.
Please don‚Äôt hesitate to make a purchase. The piece will not disappoint.  
This particular ring can be sized to easily fit any finger which adds to the versatility.  The mix of metals is very tastefully done.  Enjoy the ring!

            These are absolutely gorgeous! A first of a kind for me. The only thing is, I think the shape of my ears may not be optimal, because the earrings don't sit perfectly where they should. The part that climbs up is very near the edge of my ear and a bit tricky to keep in place. Also, I could see the shop owner carefully wrapped the earrings, nonetheless they were a bit squished upon arrival. I managed to place the silver thread in the back in alignment with the earring itself, but maybe I didn't do it right and this explains why they are not sitting perflecty on my ear? Not sure! In any case, I gave these earrings a 5 star rating because I've dealt with this wonderful artist before and she is simply amazing and offers fantastic customer service, I know she'll help me find a way to make these sit the way they should! :-) Thumbs up!
        "

            Stunning! They are now my every day earrings. They are subtle yet striking. I got the rose pearl, with the silver plate, I have now bought the white pearl to mix and match. Amazing quality, wonderful customer service. Will be getting more!

            Wonderful!!! And charmingly gift wrapped as these are for my daughter's birthday. As I've not yet seen her to bestow gifts, I used all restraint to not open to peek, but that would spoil the presentation.
And, I DID purchase two pairs in addition. One for myself, ( the Bronze 1930's...worn them 3 days in a row, love them!)  The Bronze Folklore will 
be a future gift. These arrived in rapid time, before the Birthday (delayed by snowstorms) all the way from France to New York in less than 2 weeks, with a lovely personal note to me, best wishes to my daughter in an envelope I shall keep as the mailing stamps are art as well. I  shall take another virtual vacation to a beautiful country sans doute (without a doubt?)  Merci!

            This necklace is extremely worth every penny! I love it. I wish I had the option to buy a shorter necklace but all in all it is gorgeous and well worth the price. Thank you

            I just received them today and I absolutely love them.   They are nice quality and look good on.  Would also make a nice gift for someone who sings etc. like I do.  Love them.

            Looks good from far, but cheap closeup. I requested the stone to be change to red instead of blue, the seller agreed to it but wasn't done. The quality is cheap I thought will be better quality for the price I paid. The seller is good responding to your messages, and delivery was on the  time expected.
        "

            Very sorry you didnt like the item, I mentioned that i cannot change color of the stone. The color of the stone is set as listed

            Beautiful! Daphne is my namesake and I love her story. This ring is perfect. I‚Äôm hoping the silver gets restocked :)

            The necklace is beautiful, but it took an inordinate amount of time to arrive (purchased Apr 5, 2021, received May 11, 2021). I wouldn't have minded this so much if the shipping were free, but it was $9 :/

            ¬°Esta pulsera es lo mejor que me ha pasado en meses! Amo mi pulsera de Vincent, no s√≥lo es bonita, tambi√©n se ajusta muy bien, ligera pero s√≥lida. Muchas, muchas estrellas.

            I love these climbers! I needed solid rose gold bc I wear them 24/7 and my previous plated gold climbers lost the gold. But I didn't want real diamonds in case I ever lost them. So these solid gold with CZ were the perfect combination.  Very comfortable and sparkly
        "
"
            These are breathtaking! They are actually quite long and follow the natural curve of the ear beautifully! I was worried about their solidity, but am glad to say that they are definitely solid. I get compliments ALL the time and they're very comfortable. I looooove them so much‚ù§
        "
"
            Perfect! They look even better in person and they‚Äôre so comfortable I forget I‚Äôm wearing them. Thanks also to Denize who worked with me on shipping :) Cannot recommend highly enough!!

            I love my silver choker. I am able to wear it longer or shorter. I have gotten many compliments on it. It arrived quickly and the vendor also included an adjustable silver ring at no cost as well. I will definitely buy from this vendor again.
        "

            Just received my bracelet and it exceeds my expectations!!! WOW! Absolutely beautiful. I'm not one for large, clunky jewelry so it's hard to find items that stand out without being large and clunky. This one is it! Thank you! I will wear it with joy :)

            I love working with Piccadillypendants. I had some problems with my order(my doings) and it was taken care of right away. I also love my earrings! They were just what I was looking for and this site was the only place I could find them; I can't wait to look at more jewelry!
        "
"
            These are the perfect lightweight earrings! They have a nice shine and are so light I almost don‚Äôt even notice I am wearing them. Love them as a memorial piece for the dog I recently lost.

            Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again.
        "
"
            Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy!
I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. 
However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! 
Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently.

            These earrings are absolutely adorable!!! I loved them and instantly put them in. I have not bought any earrings that climb your ear so I was nervous but they look great!!!

            It's so stinking cute!! The skulls lined up just right on my toe. Two days later it broke while I sleeping! I'm so sad.. May be better as small ring for the top of your finger...

            I totally love the look of these gold hoop earrings, they are exactly what I was searching for and have worn them everyday - however, the fastenings are wobbly and I worry they won't last that long.

            A lovely piece of jewellery, looks just like the pics, really pretty but with an industrial edge. And made to measure so really comfortable. May have to get another colour combination

            Custom necklace Ali made.for me with kuem boo gold on some of the silver nuggets. I left the choice.of which nuggets to accent up to her... The effect is breathtaking (pic does not do them justice)! The necklaces are totally separate so can be worn together or individually/various combos. I got the combination of lengths pictured.on the model. Bc the two longer ones don't have a clasp suggest being careful putting them on as the medium just makes it over my head LOL.
        "
"
            This is not my first pair of earrings from this shop and certainly wont be my last. They are so stylish, modern and well made. Ali is great at communicating whenever I have questions and she even sent me a surprise and lovely gift. Thank you so much Ali for another amazing piece!!!
        "
"
            Modern and sleek little hoops. The gold accents make them sparkle wonderfully when the light hits them. Have several pieces from Ali's shop and every single one is lovely, unique and a work of modern art. Ali was wonderful about communicating about my order, shipping times, and my package arrived super fast.

            So cute! I have only worn them once since they were delivered and received compliments on them all day; purrrfect for cat ladies young and old!  They also got to me super quick in New York from Israel :)

"
            I really love these earrings! They‚Äôre super cute and the perfect size. I also have an allergy to nickel and some other metals and so far I haven‚Äôt had a reaction yet in my weeks of wearing them. The only down side is the backs they come with are plastic so I have to use the backs from a different pair of earrings to make sure they‚Äôre secure in my ear.

            As always! Beautiful craftsmanship. My fav shop on etsy!

            I received my ring yesterday and I love it. I was advised by seller to upsize, which I did but I should've went up 1/2 more. But it fits! And I love it!
        "

            Absolutely gorgeous! This is my second purchase from this shop. I‚Äôd take a photo with the earrings on but I just recovered from Covid and I look terrible. Trust me, they are beautiful and bold. And not too heavy.

            These are totally cool in design!  They are long and very artsy!  I can hardly wait to wear them and feel totally vogue in them, LOL!  LOVE them!

            Beautiful, and classy!  These are so easy to wear because they feel weightless and go with everything. 
Thanks, Sam, for yet another addition to my collection of SDMarie jewelry!!

            Wonderful. Great quality, have not had any adverse reactions to the product. Very easy to put in and the perfect size. Large enough to see but not where its overbearing on my ear. I really love the look of the hammered silver texture on the front of the earring. 

Very easy to lose heads up!

            I love these earrings!! I‚Äôve had them for quite a few months and they are comfortable and very pretty. I keep getting compliments because of them. Definitely unique and good quality. I‚Äôm very happy with them and would by more in the future.

"
            I ordered these for myself and absolutely love them !!! They are comfortable to wear ! I never wear earrings to bed because earring backs have always bothered me but I did not have an issue with these at all ! I reached out to the shop because shipping was taking a little longer than expected and they replied the same day and were extremely helpful! (Delays were due to the postal service , not the shops problem)
        "

            I love these as an addition to my jewelry! They‚Äôre light and delicate but still eye catching.

            These earrings are exactly how they look in picture. They are so cute and well made, I've literally been wearing them almost everyday since they arrived. I was a bit skeptical if they would be comfy to wear because the point doesn't look too enticing, but you forget they are even in your ears. Perfect for the holidays! It also came in a cute tiny burlap bag to keep them safe. Arrived in a few days after being shipped. LOVE THEM THANK YOU <3

            Really pretty and quickly sent. I would definitely recommend this and buy some more from this shop !
I would have preferred the ""jacket"" to be attached to the rear part of the earing though, to make it more convenient and control its orientation (right now it has to be against your neck).

            I purchased the earrings as a birthday gift for my mom. She really liked them. Found them quite special and could see that they were handmade. Would purchase again. Thank you

            I love this piece of jewelry it‚Äôs unique  and gets a lot of attentionüôÇ the first couple times I wore it I realize that I have to keep an eye on it when dawning my Covid mask. I found when I took my mask from around my ear I saw the earring on the ground so I hv to remain conscious that its there - its so light weighted!  I just got to be careful n touch my ear now n then to make sure it‚Äôs still there! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too big I did get the large I think the small might be too small but I think I would have the same issue but I love it!  thank you.  Customer support was great because I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to get the large or the small and I measured my ear as instructed and was advised on the large.  

A Beautiful piece of jewelryüôÇ

            Oof, I love this earring. I had it in my wishlist for so long and I am very happy that I finally got it.

Things to know, the metal is extremely thin and easily bendable. To me, this is a good thing. What I didn't notice from the pictures is that the lobe portion pushes your lobe forward a bit and can look a little unflattering, but it is easy to ever so slightly bend the metal where it needs to go. I also have extremely hard cartilage that gets irritated easily so I was able to make the curve in the top a little wider to accommodate my ear.
Last thing to know if it is not wide earphone friendly. The earring will hit the pause button on my raycons, haha! Again, not much of an issue, I just adjust it and I'm good.  I've worn them all day (paired with the threader long threader earring to make that asymmetrical look).

            This is my second pair of these rose gold earring jackets.  I love them so much, I wanted a backup pair in case I lose one.  The color is absolutely beautiful.  They are a sleek, elegant design, and very high quality craftsmanship.  Perfect for a variety of styles and purposes.  Packaging is lovely, and shipping was really fast from UK.  A wonderful purchase!!
        "
"
            I wasn't sure how I would like this, but I am not exaggerating when I say I love this earring so much!!! I am a lazy person when it comes to jewelry and always prefer to keep earrings in, then forget about them. While I can't, and definitely wouldn't recommend sleeping with it on, it is always immediately back in my ear once I wake up. 
I can't recommend this shop/earring enough! Love it!

            Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!
        "
"
            Finally! I got the ring and it‚Äôs so pretty! The color is not as vibrant as in the picture‚Ä¶ a more pale pink. I got it in silver because I was afraid the gold plated would fade with time. The seller was very quick to reply to my inquiries. The shipping was slow (international shipping, from Greece to the USA). Even thou the seller provided the shipping tracking number, I wasn‚Äôt able to track it. I relied on the Etsy app telling me I could leave a review on Wednesday (today) and I received the ring on Monday. It took around 3 weeks from the day I ordered to the day it was delivered. So keep in mind the shipping times if you need the ring within a certain date.

            These are exactly what I've been looking for. They are simple but sweet. I was born with tags on my ears and my earlobes flip up. I hate dangly earrings, and normal earrings show the backs just as much as the front, so these are that perfect solution. Will definitely order from SDMarie Jewelry again!

            I‚Äôve picked my fingers for years and they look awful.  With my wedding coming up I was worried about how the pictures would look and wanted to do something to stop myself picking.  This ring has stopped me picking!  And not only that, it looks really lovely too üòç I am really really impressed with it!

            My ring is absolutely beautiful!! It‚Äôs so cute and the balls are the perfect size. I have really bad anxiety and am constantly picking at my nails and the skin on my fingers ... this is perfect to keep my hands occupied. It‚Äôs such good quality also and totally exceeded my expectations. Can‚Äôt wait to order more!! Thank you so much Elina üíó

            This was such a beautiful ring! The inspirational message with the purchase made me tear up. My anxiety has cause me to pick at my fingers for years and this ring makes me feel like I can finally break that cycle.

            The shipping was speedy and packaging lovely. I got this ring to wear alongside my silver wedding band when I am working with my hands or do not want to wear my engagement ring that day. (For some reason, my silver band alone seems too thin or that it‚Äôs just missing something-my own opinion) I do love this ring and how the rings look together. It was just what I was looking for. However, the pictures looked as though the ring is a more rounded shape, through the 2mm, where I would consider it more square on the edges, but that‚Äôs not a problem for me. Also, I did think the oxidizing was a bit heavy, but with some silver/gold polish I got it just right for what I wanted. Overall a beautiful ring with lovely details.

            Very good craftsmanship, feels solid and adapts perfectly on the ear due to adjustable length and the right shape of the jackets
        "

            I have bigger earlobes so whether or not an earring will accentuate that has always been my concern. These earring bars are the perfect size in terms of the length and the thickness, and I like that it's a round bar and not a square one. The back clasps are tight and secure and the posts are sterling silver, which are all great. To me they stand out amongst other Etsy bar earrings in all these features. 
What's worth noticing though is that the posts used here are slightly shorter and thicker than normally what you would see in stores (for example Claire's earrings). It has two dents at the end and only the second one fits my ear. Make sure you measure the earring posts you normally wear to avoid getting your ears squeezed and swollen!

            Pulls a little pinker than expected but that‚Äôs how it is ordering jewelry online. Still very cute. Its a little hard to get the jacket secured on the post but they look great and are quality.

Actually, editing and adding to the review a little later cause they tarnished so quickly, about a month or so later, without me even wearing them. I tried on once and decided they were for special occasions, but sitting in a separate jewelry box they tarnished and are now a super dark color. Almost a dirty penny. They don‚Äôt match any of my rose gold, so I can no longer use them.

            The design of the ring was absolutely beautiful. The metal of the adjustable band was a little softer than I anticipated, but it makes sense since it's meant to be adjustable. Due to how soft the metal is, I would say this feels more like occasional/costume jewelry rather than an everyday ring, but I am still satisfied with this purchase and working with this seller.

            I like it well enough, though I didn't receive the exact item pictured. I got a pair that had a clear gemstone on the one star. There was a bonus pair of climbers, though, so that was a nice surprise

            The earrings are cute ü•∞‚ú® but I've knocked off a star because I ordered them thinking they were being shipped from UK.. but they take a really long time as they're actually being sent from Bulgaria! The owner needs to update the description to include this and be transparent..
I have photos to add to the review to show this but I can't add them unless I give 5 stars!

            Kathleen from Macalania has to be one of the kindest shop managers on all of Etsy! I had experienced shipping delays due to COVID which was not her fault at all and she made sure to send out a second pair of earrings so that they would arrive in time for a gift. She consistently tracked and updated my order to make sure I felt reassured the entire time. Her generosity and kindness went above and beyond! The earrings are GORGEOUS they are delicate and shined to perfection and I love so much that they are a gold and silver color which will allow me to match with all my other jewelry. They are amazingly minimal and make the perfect gift for all your designer friends!! I cannot thank her enough for this beautiful gift and I cannot wait to buy from this shop again! Thank you thank you ‚ú®‚ú® And they were shipped with extra backings!

            These are stunning!  So pretty.  The seller is so nice!  She custom made these for me after I saw them in her ""sold"" section, and they shipped right away.  Amazing.   I love the denim lapis.  Beautiful color.  Love that you can wear them several different ways.  They're very comfortable, and easy to wear.  They arrived super fast, and were beautifully packaged with extra ear backs. Perfect!   I highly recommend this site for outstanding jewelry and customer service.

            These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! The picture doesn't show just how fine and dainty they are. They're also fairly sturdy, so I'm not worried about their durability. They are a little tricky to wear. They kept sliding off of my ear until I realized that pulling the earring a little further through my piercing tightened the grip over my ear. I recommend buying these!

            This Ring is absolutely gorgeous in every way. My husband was over the moon to receive it this Christmas. This beautiful ring is almost an exact replica of a ring that my husband bought for his Mom 50 years ago and which has worn since her passing 12 years ago. He lost it  doing yard work about a year ago just before WE married, so to say the least, he was heartbroken. We searched all over &  even used a metal detector without any luck. I began a search to see if I could possibly find one to replace it as a small token and this was it. I paid for express shipping and was not disappointed. The price, the shipping, the great customer service and the ring is exceptional in every way. My husband was overjoyed and myself too. I never knew my husband's mum but I'm sure she was as special as that ring! Thank you Kotinos!!!

            If I could give 10 stars I would!! I absolutely LOVE THESE, they are perfect and just what I wanted!! They seem to be good quality (I‚Äôll update this if they aren‚Äôt) and the shipping was super fast (I live in the US). They are small just like I hoped, for reference my second lobes are 4-5mm from the piercing to the bottom of my ear. I am so glad I bought these, there was even a free gift included! Now usually when there is a free jewelry gift, it is cheaper and not something I would actually wear; but these came with little gold rocket ship earrings with green emerald stones üò≠üò≠üò≠ I love both earrings so much!!!!

I will be recommending this shop and buying more for sure!! <3

            Cathy is one who can almost read my mind when it comes to putting together something.  I have purchased some small pouches, a hair barrette and recently a pair of earrings.  Some have been for presents but for the most part, I like her crafty items so much, I keep them for myself.  In addition, I love the variety in her designs and the colors she uses as they tend to pop with a brightness that makes one happy

            Cathy the seller is the reason I joined Etsy.  I have purchased four items from her thus far and no doubt will continue to do so.  I found that the little pouches that I purchased can be used to keep my money and coins in or cigarettes and matches - if you smoke, put your business cards,in it, etc..  It is a very versatile item.  The barrette I just purchased is to keep my long hair away from my face and with the HOT weather coming I know I will appreciate its effectiveness, practicality and as an aside, I love its dragon design.

            I originally ordered the rose gold pierced earrings and they were out of stock. They contacted me and offered me a different finish. When I got them today I mail they sent me the rose gold climbers, which I didn‚Äôt order along with the other finish of the ones I originally ordered.  Pleasant surprise and what great customer service!  Thank you

            I received a lot of compliments on this pair of earrings. The picture didn't do it justice. It's absolutely more beautiful in person. The crystals and the faceted stones are shiny, in a subtle way, which I like very much. The whole piece is elegant. It quickly became my new favorite.

            I love, love, love this Hamsa.!! Very unique and I love all the items you make. When I get more money...I will be ready for earrings and a ring!

            I‚Äôm absolutely in love with these gorgeous earrings! Due to health reasons I had to let go of my pierced ears and to be honest it wasn‚Äôt until I saw these gorgeous earrings I was ok with it. They look even more gorgeous in real life and feels like a real treasure! ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm hoping for more earrings similar to this in your shop, I‚Äôm obsessed with mine and would love to buy more later. I‚Äôve also had several compliments for them üôèüèª

            I ordered this ring in 14 K white gold. I got matching M√∂bius bands and proposed to my SO. This is the ring I ordered for myself and it is everything I wanted and more! The pictures don‚Äôt do this ring justice! It‚Äôs not too flashy, but it‚Äôs still very elegant. I would definitely recommend this ring as a budget friendly engagement ring!

            I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!

            This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are

            I so much love  my new pair of very elegant and stylish clear crystal ear climbers. Their so well made and look like the real thing. The Crystal ear climbers are a great statement piece that can be worn dressy or casual and will make any outfit look amazing.

            I love these earrings and give you a 5-star rating.  They came quickly and well packaged. They are not too heavy for my earlobes.  They have a locking mechanism that keeps the backs from being lost.  That is important because I have lost so many backs from putting on and taking off my face masks.  I love the little soft pouch they can be kept in also.  I noticed the engraved part of the signs have sparkles in them.  This, I think, adds to their appearance and glamour.  Thanks so much for your work in designing these.  I honestly look forward to buy more items from your shop.

            I totally adore the beautiful necklace !!The necklace, which arrived promptly, was  exquisitely packaged, from the beautiful ribbons & box, to the beautiful note card and wonderful quality paper for the printed cards - all so very wonderful! I  love the gorgeous colors of the necklace, the stones of excellent quality, the subtlety of the way the colors flow, the length, the design - I am delighted! Thank you very much!!

            I am so in love with these earrings! Everything about this purchase was amazing. These are my favourite everyday pair, thank you!

            These are so beautiful! I also like that you can wear them with or without the backing. My new favorite and everyday earrings!

            I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit. Only issues are putting them on and taking them off is a challenge because they are very small and have 3 pieces to manage. I've dropped the pieces several times. But that's getting better with practice.

            These earrings are BREATHTAKING. The packaging was pristine and super neat, came with a lovely hand written note. The card the earrings are attached to is high quality and beautiful watercolor. I am so happy with this purchase and so excited to wear my new earrings! Thank you so much!!! :) I am so happy to be one of your first dozen orders!

            OMG so cute! So light weight. I love that they‚Äôre studs instead of hooks! They shipped and arrived super fast. Thank you!

            I have bigger earlobes so whether or not an earring will accentuate that has always been my concern. These earring bars are the perfect size in terms of the length and the thickness, and I like that it's a round bar and not a square one. The back clasps are tight and secure and the posts are sterling silver, which are all great. To me they stand out amongst other Etsy bar earrings in all these features. 
What's worth noticing though is that the posts used here are slightly shorter and thicker than normally what you would see in stores (for example Claire's earrings). It has two dents at the end and only the second one fits my ear. Make sure you measure the earring posts you normally wear to avoid getting your ears squeezed and swollen!

            Pulls a little pinker than expected but that‚Äôs how it is ordering jewelry online. Still very cute. Its a little hard to get the jacket secured on the post but they look great and are quality.

Actually, editing and adding to the review a little later cause they tarnished so quickly, about a month or so later, without me even wearing them. I tried on once and decided they were for special occasions, but sitting in a separate jewelry box they tarnished and are now a super dark color. Almost a dirty penny. They don‚Äôt match any of my rose gold, so I can no longer use them.

            I purchased these with the double bronze drop rings for my birthday.  They are beautiful together---separately---and mixed and matched! So many combinations. Sizing is accurate. Shipping was better than expected with current border restrictions.  I love them.
        "
"
            Nice, but was hoping it was bigger. Didn't realize how tiny they were. But are pretty.
        "
"
            These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! The picture doesn't show just how fine and dainty they are. They're also fairly sturdy, so I'm not worried about their durability. They are a little tricky to wear. They kept sliding off of my ear until I realized that pulling the earring a little further through my piercing tightened the grip over my ear. I recommend buying these!
        "

            I'm not that into statement items, but these were to pretty to pass up!! I got the green version and I could not be any happier!! Love them! ps they're just like the photo!!

            Merci pour l'envoi de ces beaux bijoux dans un joli pochon et bien prot√©g√©s par l'enveloppe bulle. J'ai bien aim√© le message timbre ""Un grand merci"" ! Tout est arriv√© dans le d√©lais estim√© par Etsy. J'utilise deux bagues d'oreille dor√©es (une martel√©e et une ""classique"") et elle sont confortables, tiennent bien et habillent joliment mes oreilles :) Le collier initiale et l'autre bague d'oreille dor√©e sont un cadeau pour No√´l, et j''esp√®re que √ßa plaira ! Belles f√™tes de fin d'ann√©e ! (m√™me si elles ne seront pas comme les autres !)
P.S. : Je mets le m√™me avis pour chaque bijou achet√©, d√©sol√©e pour la r√©p√©tition !

            J'attendais avec impatience mon colis et claiiirement je n'ai pas √©t√© d√©√ßue ! Je suis ravie du bijou, il est magnifique (tout comme le reste des bijoux command√©s), √ßa habille parfaitement mon oreille comme les photos le laissaient pr√©sager ! N'h√©sitez pas !! :)

            Beautiful  delicate earing just love the color. It's me.

            So ....I was trying to achieve a look. My own hair dye failed to make the cut, but these extensions did not! 
The seller was incredible and created a custom color just for the style I was trying to achieve. They are vibrant, and even after styling they held their color.
I‚Äôm looking into other combos just to keep for the fun of it. They hold well to fine hair (like my own) and give a great option for customizing your signature look :) VERY pleased.

            Boucles re√ßues en France 10 jours apr√®s la commande. Il serrait bien d'indiquer le diam√®tre de la perle, la photo ne permet pas de l'√©valuer. Elles m'ont paru plus petites en r√©alit√©. Et la finition de l'attache de la perle pourrait √™tre un peu plus soign√©e. Autrement tr√®s jolies boucles, perles ros√©es et c'est encore plus joli.

Thank you, Julia and I love your Etsy store!!

            I love the cute little bee friend so much! Looks really pretty and happy under some sunlight. The only issue I had was the chain it came on kept breaking after I'd  fix it, so I just put it on one or my own chains

            I am very happy with my experience with LilyOM.  Einat was very helpful and a great communicator.  The pants took a look time to arrive because, as she explained to me she was waiting on her order to arrive.  As a consolation for the wait, she threw in a free bra, which I love and didn't realize she sold.  The quality of the fabric (both pants and bra) is soft and lovely and the package arrived smelling like roses!  Thank you!

            Wonderful. Great quality, have not had any adverse reactions to the product. Very easy to put in and the perfect size. Large enough to see but not where its overbearing on my ear. I really love the look of the hammered silver texture on the front of the earring. 

Very easy to lose heads up!

            I love these earrings!! I‚Äôve had them for quite a few months and they are comfortable and very pretty. I keep getting compliments because of them. Definitely unique and good quality. I‚Äôm very happy with them and would by more in the future.

            I ordered these for myself and absolutely love them !!! They are comfortable to wear ! I never wear earrings to bed because earring backs have always bothered me but I did not have an issue with these at all ! I reached out to the shop because shipping was taking a little longer than expected and they replied the same day and were extremely helpful!

            Update 2:
Charlotte followed up with me promptly about the status from her postal office. It‚Äôs been delayed there & unsure of when it‚Äôll arrive. She sent a new pair earrings for free to New Zealand immediately. I really appreciate it! 

Update 1:
The store owner has replied me after I posted this review. I‚Äôm glad to know she has contacted the postal office. The item hasn‚Äôt arrived in New Zealand yet. I don‚Äôt know what the quality is yet. I‚Äôll edit my review once it arrives. 
============
Purchased on 2/17 to have it shipped to New Zealand. It‚Äôs March 26 today & still in transit. Wrote to the owner a week ago if s/he can send me any status of the package. No reply. I‚Äôm very disappointed with this shop. If you are the owner reading this, please reply my message ASAP, or I‚Äôll have to send a complain.

            Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again.

            Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy!
I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. 
However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! 
Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently.

            Earrings are beautiful and shipping was fast. I also really like the handwritten note.

            To say I am obsessed with these earrings is an understatement! They are so neutral and look great with my 10 other earrings (what can I say? I like to decorate my ears!).

            These shipped so quickly, the packaging secured them very well, and the actual climbers are perfect. No green on the skin, no worries about the clampy part slipping off my ear. These are perfect

            The climbers are even better than I thought. Very pleased with this order! Lightning fast shipping. Will order again!

            This style had the perfect style of gems and length I was looking for, and was a great value. The business was very communicative and considerate (Covid related delays).
        "
"
            I love these climbers! I needed solid rose gold bc I wear them 24/7 and my previous plated gold climbers lost the gold. But I didn't want real diamonds in case I ever lost them. So these solid gold with CZ were the perfect combination.  Very comfortable and sparkly
        "
"
            Well The 14k two tone gold Gucci was beautiful but the size 2.5 that I got it was hard to see the two-tone! But That‚Äôs just my opinion. This being my first gold necklace, an Denize was wonderful I contacted her and I exchanged it for a solid Gold color marina, 14k gold necklace length 18‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Also purchased a second necklace 14k solid tricolor gold Valentino, 22‚Äù and I love that one too, both from Denize.
        "

            So. Beautiful. This chain is teeny and dainty. I wear it as a choker. I can‚Äôt believe how low the price is for such a great piece. Also, it shipped and arrived to me so fast. I feel so pretty. All the stars! Xo
        "
"
            I can not say enough how amazing this is! I have very sensitive skin and can only wear gold or steel, so finding a good quality gold fill chain that is so dantiy has always been a struggle until now!

            Very beautiful earrings. On the picture they look more massive, than there are actually. I was  a bit scared that they might be too heavy, but they are perfect size and weight)) Thank you!  Just an idea, my friends have told  that therese faces look like famous Russian poet - A. Pushkin, or lile zodiac sign - Gemini:))) so it can be a nice gift fro people born in June) Thank you, and also thank you for the nice box and bag with flower. was very sweet)

            Gorgeous ear cuff!  I saw this on the site and it was not in stock.  Vivi was excellent in communicating with me and when she got it in, she let me know and I ordered it.  So happy I waited to get it.  Shipped quickly in a cute leopard box, is beautifully made with excellent little sparkly cz stones, sits snugly on my ear, and is simply quite an elegant little piece of jewelry.  LOVE IT!!

            I'm incredibly thrilled with this ring! First time ordering with Zircon - this is my new go to for jewellery for exceptionally well crafted product with lustrous shine.  I love bold rings with a realistic look and fee.  This ring meets all my needs!
Ordered a size 6 and fits very comfortably!

            It is honestly a great ring. Nice quality and you can't beat the price. Although it didn't work out for me (my ring didn't fit well with it) I highly recommend this shop!

            This is my third ring from Isabelle -- I loved my first two so much I thought I would buy the oxidized silver ring, even though I was a little unsure about it. It is actually my favorite! It is so beautiful in person -- subtle and stunning and goes with everything; a perfect everyday ring.
        "
"
            I adore this ring!  I have purchased numerous pieces from Isabelle at the One of A Kind Show and they have become staples in my ring collection. 
Her attention to detail and the quality of her pieces rival any big jeweller.
Please don‚Äôt hesitate to make a purchase. The piece will not disappoint.  
This particular ring can be sized to easily fit any finger which adds to the versatility.  The mix of metals is very tastefully done.  Enjoy the ring!

            These are absolutely gorgeous! A first of a kind for me. The only thing is, I think the shape of my ears may not be optimal, because the earrings don't sit perfectly where they should. The part that climbs up is very near the edge of my ear and a bit tricky to keep in place. Also, I could see the shop owner carefully wrapped the earrings, nonetheless they were a bit squished upon arrival. I managed to place the silver thread in the back in alignment with the earring itself, but maybe I didn't do it right and this explains why they are not sitting perflecty on my ear? Not sure! In any case, I gave these earrings a 5 star rating because I've dealt with this wonderful artist before and she is simply amazing and offers fantastic customer service, I know she'll help me find a way to make these sit the way they should! :-) Thumbs up!

            Stunning! They are now my every day earrings. They are subtle yet striking. I got the rose pearl, with the silver plate, I have now bought the white pearl to mix and match. Amazing quality, wonderful customer service. Will be getting more!

            I needed to add a birthstone ring to my collection - we had another baby! The seller of the original set I have is no longer live on Etsy so I searched for a similar ring and this was the closest I could find. It‚Äôs the closest I could possibly ask for considering I was looking to match a 6 year old set. It blends right in with the other three I already had and makes a complete set. Shipping was super fast and tracking was updated which is always nice. Overall I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase.

            I have purchased many ear jackets and studs from Emma.  She also did a custom stud earring for me with boulder opal that was beautiful.  Very happy with everything I have received, and the fact that she is so pleasant and accommodating!  I enjoy being a customer and communicating with her.

            I am so pleased with my purchase of earrings with gold and silver jackets. The packaging was so pretty and the earrings are gorgeous. I highly recommend this shop. Thanks so much.

            Took exactly 6 weeks to receive these earrings but finally they arrived safely and I am loving them! Very comfortable- the posts are not too long so they do not poke behind the ear. They fit my lobe better in my second piercing- rather than the first- but that works just as well. I love anything new and different and these are certainly that! Thank you!
        "
"
            Love the weight and feel of these, as well as how secure the notched posts feel. The gold is very warm and shiny, making the snakiness very subtle, which I love. Now I want them in silver too!

            My second pair of earrings from this shop, and I doubt it will be my last! I ALWAYS get compliments whenever I wear either pair. The craftsmanship is amazing, as is the shop owners communication. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you!!

            I absolutely love this ring. I've spend ages looking for a unique piece of jewelry and finally found it with this one. I also always have trouble finding jewelry that fits because I'm quite petite. Thanks to the wide range of sizes I finally found a ring that fits. The seller is also amazing and easy to reach via message. A+ customer service. Package arrived quickly and beautifully packaged. I immediately sent a picture of the ring to my friends cause I was so ecstatic! I will definitely be buying again from this shop.

            Great seller, excellent communication, and a very creative idea!  
 The ruffled edge is lovely.  I like them best with my tiniest studs with only one of the jackets.   I bought numerous sets of colors and sizes but found the layering to be a bit clunky which also resulted in a short stud stem.  They felt like they might fall off easily.

            Purchased these for one of my bridesmaids and I'm really tempted to get myself a pair too! The seller was great, especially when I had to make a change to my order! Would buy from this shop again!

            I love these earrings. They were a bit bigger than I had wanted but I followed my intuition and got them any ways and was instantly ecstatic when I put them in. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt the only one who like them as my pet chicken ate them... right out of my ears. I immediately ordered a second pair and anxiously awaited their arrival and am so happy they are here. I‚Äôve favorited a few more like them but with different stones. I have sensitive ears and not one issue. I love them!! Thank you so much Heart House Studio they are FABULOUS üíú

            Since becoming pregnant my hands get swollen throughout the day and my wedding ring no longer fits. üíî I was looking to find something simple and elegant that I could wear during my pregnancy. This adjustable ring is perfect! I can literally change the size throughout the day as my hands change. It's is very delicate which is my style. I love it. 

My original order got lost in the mail over the holidays but the seller was kind enough to send me a replacement. She was very good at communicating back and forth while I was upset about the long time it had been since ordering it and not receiving it. She was very kind and made the process smooth and hassle free.

            Loved these gold ear climbers! They are so cute. I have an allergy to some metals, but I can keep these in my lobe overnight with no issue. 

I also can wear them while wearing my headset. they don't bother me like some of my hoops and studs. I'm really happy with these earrings.

            I love these earrings so much that I've bought them in silver, too! They're the perfect size, and they add just the tiniest bit of edge.

            The earrings arrived very fast, feel high quality, and are just incredibly charming. They are for my daughter for Easter. She's been wanting to try dangly earrings but has been too intimidated to try them. I think these will be the perfect gateway earrings :))

            I love, Love, LOVE these eye-catching snowman earrings! üòç I like front back earrings in general, and these are perfect for the holidays! I am so happy with how they fit me, meaning the snowflakes hang down low enough to be seen and are not hidden behind my ear. I appreciate the high quality of the earrings, and the little soft bag they come in just adds a touch of elegance. The earrings also come with an extra pair of backs if you want to just wear the snowman without the snowflake jacket.

I cannot say enough good things about this seller. Kellan & Kiera are absolutely fantastic! Besides super fast shipping, they included a sweet handwritten thank you card. This was my first purchase on Etsy and I will definitely be shopping here again!!

            My fianc√© realized a week out from our wedding that he needed cuff links for his shirt. He liked the idea of the initials design, so I reached out to the seller with my concerns. She was very friendly and was able to turn around our order very quickly, and it arrived with 3 days to go! Even more impressive considering it was sent from Turkey, and I‚Äôm still waiting on orders from the US where we reside. Pretty box, the cuff links look like good quality.

            Very high quality product. I am always a bit worried ordering online. I was especially anxious to see the quality of cuff links. I was worried they have not be as thick as I would like. However the are very sturdy and have a nice weight to them. I would highly recommend. The gift box is also beautiful. Very nice keepsake !!!!

            It was a pleasure to order from Seher. I placed my order on 5/5/21 and received it in San Francisco, CA on 5/12/21. Seher sent me a draft prior to production and communicated with me each step of the process (mock up, completed cuff links, and shipment). The cuff links are gorgeously packaged and of high quality of 925 silver. It should last a long time with good care. Highly recommend!

            Really great clip. I got one pink and one white by mistake, but I still like them both. I was worried about how the shape would look, would it stick out. But this is now my favorite clip. It had great staying power and looks fabulous in my hair!! Great clip for thick hair for sure!

            This is a great size, I have thick, long hair and it holds it up well. The color is a bit more orange in person, but I don‚Äôt mind. It‚Äôs really good quality too, and the price is good.

            These earrings are absolutely gorgeous! The picture doesn't show just how fine and dainty they are. They're also fairly sturdy, so I'm not worried about their durability. They are a little tricky to wear. They kept sliding off of my ear until I realized that pulling the earring a little further through my piercing tightened the grip over my ear. I recommend buying these!

            The hook goes upward along the curve of the ear. Get used to that, and you're good :) I like these small but not ""dainty"" earrings. Sometimes, you just need serotonin. And when you can't make your own, store-bought is fine!
        "
"
            I have bigger earlobes so whether or not an earring will accentuate that has always been my concern. These earring bars are the perfect size in terms of the length and the thickness, and I like that it's a round bar and not a square one. The back clasps are tight and secure and the posts are sterling silver, which are all great. To me they stand out amongst other Etsy bar earrings in all these features. 
What's worth noticing though is that the posts used here are slightly shorter and thicker than normally what you would see in stores (for example Claire's earrings). It has two dents at the end and only the second one fits my ear. Make sure you measure the earring posts you normally wear to avoid getting your ears squeezed and swollen!

            Pulls a little pinker than expected but that‚Äôs how it is ordering jewelry online. Still very cute. Its a little hard to get the jacket secured on the post but they look great and are quality.

Actually, editing and adding to the review a little later cause they tarnished so quickly, about a month or so later, without me even wearing them. I tried on once and decided they were for special occasions, but sitting in a separate jewelry box they tarnished and are now a super dark color. Almost a dirty penny. They don‚Äôt match any of my rose gold, so I can no longer use them.

            I absolutely love these! They are a little bit more tiny than I expected but that‚Äôs okay, I love them just the way they are! 

They are real silver, I did a couple of at home tests to confirm it and I have extremely sensitive skin, so if they weren‚Äôt real silver I couldn‚Äôt wear them for long periods of them. I have been wearing them for a little over 48 hours and my ears are fine! 

I highly recommend those, they are super cute, great quality and got here (Canada) very quickly! ü•∞ü¶ïü¶ñ

            I absolutely LOVED my earrings. I got so many compliments on my wedding day. They were simple and yet they also stood out in the best way. And the best part is I can still wear them to work or for a night out!

            These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!

            Absolutely love these earrings! I was hesitant to purchase them at first because they‚Äôre a bit pricey, but I looked everywhere and kept coming back to this design. Simple yet unique and elegant with great shine! Not too clunky - exactly what I was looking for! Shipped and delivered super fast!

            These are the most sparkly and beautiful earrings I have ever owned! I was worried about getting dangle earrings because sometimes they hurt. These ones are perfect! I'm allergic to most types of earrings and these don't hurt, I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! They absolutely perfect!!

            I am very happy with my experience with LilyOM.  Einat was very helpful and a great communicator.  The pants took a look time to arrive because, as she explained to me she was waiting on her order to arrive.  As a consolation for the wait, she threw in a free bra, which I love and didn't realize she sold.  The quality of the fabric (both pants and bra) is soft and lovely and the package arrived smelling like roses!  Thank you!

            Great quality and so much prettier then the photos posted. A definate must to add to your jewelery collection.

            I am completely blown away with how fantastic the customer service has been throughout my buying process. Einat was terrific about communication, and even though there were a couple snags she did everything she could to make sure I was happy, and kindly gifted me a little extra goodie with my original order. Plus the pants are super comfy and a gorgeous color. I'm in love ‚ù§Ô∏èüåû LILYOM has just earned a customer for life!

            These are so amazing! I keep getting compliments everywhere I go! I was a little nervous about the metal since I have sensitive ears but I haven‚Äôt had any issues!

            Extremely cute, arrived in very good time considering the state of the post right now, and I am really pleased with them! I was expecting the cherry part to feel soft, and it's more like a marble. Nothing wrong with that! I was surprised but not unpleasantly so! Excellent experience.

            These earrings are amazing! One of the easiest pair to put on and the most compliments I've ever received! Nice weight to them as well. Would definitely recommend and I've directed a few to this page! I have to hide these from my mother ha ha maybe I'll have to get another pair for mother's day ü§î

            The earrings are exactly as pictured except more sparkle! I initially ordered in gold but needed to exchange for silver to better match my dress and the seller was extremely kind and helpful with the process. For me, these earrings are a little edgy/modern while still classic making them really versatile. I absolutely love my earrings, thank you Dana!!

            They are absolutely beautiful. I got multiple compliments the first time I wore them. My only complaint is that the earring backs are not the best and come off very easily. I have gone out and bought other backs because I definitely would be very sad to lose one of these!!

            i LOVE my unicorn snow-globe necklace!  i have worn it every day since it arrived.  the quality is very nice--the size is not too large, but large enough that you can easily see the unicorn charm inside.  the glitter swirls when you wear this while walking.  i have received many compliments on this necklace!  i will probably order another one as a gift because people like it so much! i highly recommend this seller.  fast international shipping.

            SO PRETTY! I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on this beautiful jewelry. I actually  just wear it all day and to bed/shower/etc and haven‚Äôt had any problems w wear/chipping/etc. 

I also accidentally dropped the star stud down the sink, so I had to switch the chain to the moon stud‚Äî still works great! üòä‚≠êÔ∏èüåô

            It is just pefect! The communication with the seller was really friendly and she was super helpful when it came to customization, I would totally buy again from this shop - also the earpiece arrived way earlier than estimated! Really great shop, if you're hesitant, just go for it :-)

            I am ecstatic about my new pair of customised tassel earrings. The seller is amazing! She had my earrings done up and delivered so fast! The earrings are so cute and customised into a silver metal from gold and white tassel to suit my Asian skin colour. Super love!

            I wear the triple band ring as a pinky ring. My pinky is about a size 4 and it fits perfectly and looks fantastic. I really love this ring. It seems like it resizes easily but I think it probably looks best and is more comfortable on smaller fingers. I love the design and it looks great!

            This is so much more beautiful in person. I‚Äôve had it a few weeks, worn all day and night, and it‚Äôs not gotten tangled or caught on anything and been so easy! I was initially worried it would be too short in length but it‚Äôs perfect. Doesn‚Äôt choke while trying to sleep and lays perfectly during the day.

            Purchased the gold link bracelet and it by far exceeded my expectations! It looks great in the photos but in person it‚Äôs so much prettier. Love the minimalist style! I don‚Äôt wear much jewelry but this I‚Äôll keep on always :)

            I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my ring so much!!! It is beautifully made and is exactly as described!! I got the most amazing and most patient customer service from Miss Zang! I was given updates at every step and was also provided with pictures of the stone before the ring was made. I had so many questions but she patiently answered all of them and accommodated my last minute requests for customisations. Given the current situation it took a few weeks to get here but it was totally worth the wait! If you can‚Äôt tell, I am extremely happy üòä

            OMG! I AM SO HAPPY with my most recent Lenti purchases! The earrings are beautiful. They are so light and have great movement. I am hooked (literally) I will be purchasing more Lenti earrings for myself and as gifts. 

The necklace is smaller than I thought, and the clasp is backward for me but I LOVE IT!! It is great to wear by itself, with the crescent moon earrings, and it also looks fabulous with my Kyanite necklace. The chain links make it very easy to adjust lengths. My picture shows the many ways I can wear my new jewelry. Thank you.

            My third purchase from the shop. Vasso makes jewelry that I just want to wear ALL THE TIME. These pearl stud earrings are timeless pieces that go with any outfit. They are simple yet intricate and sophisticated. You can tell they are excellent quality and made with meticulousness and care. In addition, Vasso is so lovely and easy to communicate with. I had a few questions and concerns along the way and Vasso was responsive and attentive. Shipping was super quick and somehow even faster than domestic shipping! Once again I couldn't have been happier with my purchase. Thank you, Vasso.

            Oh my GOODNESS!! This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! I received it much sooner than I anticipated, and it came in a beautiful box with a hand written note. Vasso, thank you so much! I adore this necklace. I‚Äôve never felt smooth kyanite before - when I find it where I live now, it‚Äôs rough and much lighter in color. These kyanite pieces are bold and smooth and quite powerful statements from nature. I‚Äôm so so proud to have this piece and will probably wear it every day. Also, it came with some beautiful herbs that decorated the inside of the package. Such a beautiful and lovely touch. I‚Äôm curious as to what they are! Buy this piece - you will be in awe!

            I‚Äôm  really happy about it. It was a gift for my girlfriend and she wears it all the time now. It came really fast and it looks very nice.

            Love the concept of these, the quality and work of the seller! Though I would love if it had one extra height hole in the back of the moon part (there are two in order to adjust the height of the moon relative to the bottom of your ear). My earring holes are quite low, so the moon dangles more than the reference image; the extra hole would be nice to make it fit closer to the lobe. Regardless, they're beautiful!

            These are perfect! I have to have tiny earrings because my earlobes are small and my piercings are closer together since having torn lobes repaired. I have a hard time finding the size I need and these are exactly what I needed. I searched high and low for the perfect Saturn studs and these did not disappoint! Excellent craftsmanship!

            Absolutely beautiful, I love them! So happy with both pairs of earrings I purchased! Handmade with care, interesting and unique.

            Super fast shipping. Jewelry is as described, and even nicer in real life than on the website. I especially like the fact that the clasp on the chain is slim enough to fit through the pendant attachment, so I can swap out different chains. Very thoughtful.

            I love this ear cuff!  It is even better in person.  Also, what I didn't realize is that the chained sword can slide along the bottom ring of the cuff which I super appreciate bc then you can place it where you want - I love this feature a lot bc I really prefer things hanging more on the front of my ear than off the side.  Seller was so nice to receive and get this order out to me the day before(!) he left on a trip - amazing.

            I came across this shop by accident and decided to give it a try after eyeing a few very beautiful ear cuffs for a few days.

After ordering, I was not disappointed. The ear cuffs I received were so gorgeous that I decided to place a second order, but this time I opted for a custom piece. Tommy was super responsive and I so appreciated his support with helping me create something lovely with the color of stones I desired. I highly recommend this shop for not only beautiful pieces, but excellent customer service!

            When I received my order it was clear to me that the color of the center stone was not the right match for my wedding dress. I sent Tommy a picture of my dress and he immediately suggested the right color center stone, even sending photos and videos to ensure I could see the color in different lighting. When I told him I planned to wear them for my upcoming wedding, he made sure to rush production so I would receive them in time. I can‚Äôt wait to receive the new pair! Thanks, Tommy.

            This piece is so pretty! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. I bought one for each ear but I like the look of just 1 in better. When they‚Äôre both in together it‚Äôs almost too much because of how sparkly they are

Le produit; tr√®s jolie.

            A beautiful and very cleanly crafted ring.  It is aesthetically pleasing both its appearance and its feel.  It is adjustable but fit perfectly as is.  It looks so intricate it is as if it was made by elves from lord of the rings.  This was a very high quality piece and although it took a long time to arrive it was worth the wait, the quality is every bit worth your patience.

            Wow are these gorgeous! I‚Äôm a minimalist and picky about what goes into my closet. I‚Äôve searched for a few years and finally found the perfect piece. They‚Äôre light, well-crafted, extremely stylish. Very happy customer!

            I‚Äôve recently had to go back to wearing glasses, so I picked out unusual frames that are like jewelry... I get lots of compliments.  I wanted small earrings that compliment rather than compete with them. I found exactly what I was looking for!  I bought two pairs, one in my signature peace sign design, and they‚Äôre perfect.  The quality is amazing and the way this artist packaged these was great too!  Take a look at what she has to offer... you‚Äôll find things you love too!

            La vendeuse r√©pond tr√®s vite aux messages et a eu la gentillesse de me cr√©er une fiche personnalis√©e prenant en compte le surcout li√© √† un envoie par colissimo. Emballage minimal exp√©dition et r√©ception rapides. Les motifs et couleurs sont conformes et tr√®s joli. Seul b√©mol le ch√¢le est annonc√© en coton, mais il semble √™tre en mati√®re synth√©tique type polyester ou polyamide, et aucune √©tiquette n'est pr√©sente sur le produit. Dommage.

            I am so happy I went with this Etsy seller. I LOVE this ring. Had it checked to verify it is 10k and real moissanite. 

I can‚Äôt stop looking at it and will DEFINITELY be looking for Mother‚Äôs Day and Christmas! Thank you Harshita for answering my many questions also. I am very particular about stone size and having my rings be similar in thickness and width.  Pictured is my new eternity bezel set 1.24 ctw in moissanite next to my 2 ct moissanite solitaire ‚ù§Ô∏è I love love love!!!!!

            These earrings are so beautiful and delicate and the diamond quality is incredible. I continue to add pieces from this designer to my collection for ALL of my piercings, including my cartilage helix piercing. I love that they also can make them for piercings - that is so rare and hard to find with real diamonds and high quality gold without overpaying for the name brand. These are just as if not more gorgeous as any of the high-end piercing brands out there, at between a quarter or half of the price. You will not be disappointed!!!

            Update: 1/19/2021 
Unfortunately I am changing my review because after about a month a stone has already fallen out. I am truly so disappointed because the ring is gorgeous (that isn't the issue) and this was not a cheap piece of jewelry. I had reached out to the business to see what the steps could be and have never heard anything back. I know this happens in jewelry with the gems falling out but a month seems too quick for me. I wouldn't order again because for the price I paid for the ring and the short amount of time I had it isn't worth it. I will buy from places that have insurance/warranty. 


Words cannot express how much I love this ring. I bought it for because my sons birthstone is Ruby and I love how it goes with the rose gold band. It‚Äôs a very dainty, great stackable ring. Thank you so much!!

            Wow! I ordered this diamond sun ray‚òÄÔ∏èring in rose gold. I thought I would wear it on my pointer finger as an accent for showier rings on my actual ring finger. Wrong! This is a STATEMENT ring! An absolute stunner! ü§© It is gorgeous, and .31 ctw of diamonds is actually a lot of diamonds for this setting. The ring is super sparkly and definitely draws attention.üåü From a practical perspective, you should be aware that the sun rays that extend out horizontally (at the base of the ring) are pretty long. In my photo, you can see they actually extend out a bit past the width of my finger. Because of that, I won‚Äôt be wearing this ring while playing the piano or being active, but man, what a gorgeous piece! ü§ó

            OMG, these earrings are sooooooo bada$$!!! I searched high and low for a triple spike earring and am thrilled to finally have found these through Etsy. I ordered a 10 mm, 14 k gold pair. The quality is unreal. They are solid gold and feel very sturdy and the clasp feels very secure. The polish is beautiful too! So shiny! Honestly, they exceeded my expectations. I have never written a review on Etsy before this one, but this item deserves it and more! I can not praise them enough‚Äì‚Äì‚Äìboth product and seller‚Äìtop-notch. Look no further. You will not be disappointed!

            I wanted to buy my daughter her first real diamond (it‚Äôs her birth stone) for her Sweet 16. She was born 3 months premature and her birth stone was supposed to be ruby. This lovely ring has both. I‚Äôm speechless about how beautiful this ring is, it‚Äôs prettier than expected. It came in a beautiful box. However I had purchased this heart box before the ring came. So I am using the heart because it fits this occasion better. The craftsmanship is wonderful. It‚Äôs dainty yet sturdy. It shines bright and shiny. My daughter will love it. It‚Äôs an item that for sure can be handed down as a family heirloom. Especially if she has a daughter of her own one day. Thank you!

            My earrings shipped quickly and are absolutely gorgeous in person. I got the 10mm size and they are a little bigger than I expected. The diamonds are very large and sparkly and the clasp feels very secure, I haven‚Äôt taken these off since they arrived.

            Stunning! Its from my home country and its a double happiness. So glad I cane across this piece and the shop. The shipping was super fast. I received the bracelet in US in 4 days!

            La boutique; Super sympathique, r√©pondent aux questions, sont rapides et efficaces.

Le produit; tr√®s jolie. Je suis un peu d√©√ßue par la taille car je m‚Äôattendais √† plus petit mais j‚Äôai quand m√™me mis 5 √©toiles car sur l‚Äôimage on voit bien que √ßa fait la taille d‚Äôune pi√®ce de 1 euro et qu‚Äôau lieu de regarder la pi√®ce j‚Äôai imagin√© dans ma t√™te et l‚Äôai vu plus petite. 

Merci pour tout!

            Second pair. Love this shop! My 1st pair was the black in this style and now I have the gold. So so so many compliments on these at work! Thank you
        "
"
            Great items. Ear jacket is the perfect size. A bit hard to put on first time but it's very elegant looking . The small earrings are dainty and beautiful, have enough detail despite their size. Both stay put in ears. The metal backs of the earrings were hurting me so I replaced with rubber backs. Seller shipped quickly and prices are fair. Awesome purchase!
        "
"
            Same as the other earrings I ordered. I love the way they look once I get them on. They're difficult for me to put on because of the three holes on the jacket piece - it's hard to get them even. The back is extremely small and I have trouble getting it on and off. But they are really pretty once I finally get them on. I will enjoy wearing them.
        "
"
            These are great! I love the adjustable backing. Turns out my ears are different sizes, so they need to be on different holes but they still look even.
        "
"
            I ordered the Matte Rose gold for myself and gave the shiny rose gold to my sister. We love them! Great for everyday wear! The quality is awesome and the price is affordable! Awesome customer service! Can't ask for anything more! Thank you!

            I love my Sterling silver and matte gold ear crawlers. I receive the best compliments when I wear them out with my hair up. 
Vermeil Supplies has great customer service and A+ quality. Thank you!

            These are EXACTLY what I was looking for! I love having these in my third piercing and they're incredibly comfortable even to sleep in. I just ordered the lotus flower studs and can't wait to add to my collection! 
        "
"
            These are the perfect simple earrings, that give you a little edge to your everyday wear. My original pair got lost in the mail (i think one of my neighbors stole them, cause they were so cute!) I told them what happened and she shipped out another pair and all i had to pay was the shipping! Super fast responses and amazing products! Will definitely order again!  :)

            I can't say enough good things about this shop. Their jewelry is high quality, their prices are great, and the customer service is fantastic! Pretty soon, I'll have bought a pair of every earring they have.  :)

            They look gorgeous! Small enough to use for work, yet edgy enough to go out. Love ‚Äòem! Bought them in two different tones.

            This is my 2nd purchase from this shop, and I plan to buy more again in the future. I purchased these earrings in gold, silver and rose gold, plus a 14mm gold and was very happy with them! The hoops are perfect for everyday wear, and are great way to enhance any outfit. Thank you for great items and friendly customer service!

            Beautiful, exactly as pictured.  They work in my third lobe piercings perfectly.  The post is a bit short, so they fit closely to the lobe, which keeps them in position.  Definitely recommend!

            These are gorgeous!!!  Much better than the photos!  The contrast of blue and white is stunning. .. Although the size of the clip is smaller than others, and not secure, and slipped off,, quickly,,, resulting in getting lost. ( I loved them so much that I insisted on putting them back on many times.) I deducted a star for that.  Quick delivery, good packaging and a great personal feel to the service. Thanks Fad√©la ""ClipAddict"" !!!

            I purchased the small hammered sterling silver circle earrings with ear jackets and they are great. I have itty bitty earlobes so I only wear post earrings so as not to damage my ear. That means I rarely get to wear dangly or long earrings. With the addition of the ear jackets, these give the illusion of a hanging earring, a depth of design I usually cannot achieve.  Very happy.
        "
"
            This is my second purchase and if I could rate Higher than 5 stars I would!  My first order was the X and O earrings and I get so many compliments on them, they are beautifully crafted and I love them!
A little while ago I requested a custom order for hearts hammered like the X and O and again, they are beautifully crafted!  
Customer service is amazing!  One of my favourite shops!!
Thank you!!  : )

            Ildiko is my kindred spirit of jewelry makers. The first time I saw her work was at the market in Port Moody, British Columbia about 10 years ago. It was instant jewelry-love: classics with just a hint of sass. I‚Äôve slowly been building my collection of Ildiko silver ever since by putting them on my birthday/Christmas wish lists. Each piece is a gorgeous workhorse that draws comments from coworkers/strangers and is durable enough to withstand daily wear.
I was looking for gold hoops and was thrilled when Ildiko expanded out to gold. These hoops are as beautiful IRL as in the photos. With a little twist of the hook you can adjust which way they hang. (I like mine to hang parallel to my face.) Her online customer service is as friendly and efficient as her in-person market service. I can‚Äôt recommend Ildiko‚Äôs jewelry enough!

            They are super cute, but they irritated my skin. So beware if you have sensitive skin. I ordered them in black rhodium so it might just be that material I'm sensitive to. I also have the moon phase ear climbers in sterling silver and they don't bother me. I will definitely order more earrings from this shop!

            Awesome earrings, great quality. Love how you can wear trianular piece separately. Fast shipping. Back metal bracket a little short- the spikes barely hang underneath my ear lobe and you cant see them much.

            Such a beautiful and unique piece! I really love this bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and bracelets tend to be too big for me, but this one fits perfect! It has an adjustable clasp so I was able to fit it exactly right. I look forward to buying from this shop again.
        "
"
            Super cute! Makes my t-rex loving heart happy!
I will say I struggled to get this in. You screw off the head and put the base through the back and then screw the head back on. It took a good half an hour. A ball in back would have been so much easier. 
However, like I said, my heart is so happy and I never want to take this out! 
Not the best pic, my flash was on. Without flash it was too blurry since my rooms aren't lit enough apparently.
        "

            These earrings are absolutely adorable!!! I loved them and instantly put them in. I have not bought any earrings that climb your ear so I was nervous but they look great!!!
        "
"
            It's so stinking cute!! The skulls lined up just right on my toe. Two days later it broke while I sleeping! I'm so sad.. May be better as small ring for the top of your finger...
        "
"
            I love it! It's very pretty, and very very sophistacated. I have to practice a bit with wearing it. The shape of my ear is probably a bit different. Therefore the upper part of the cuff hurts a little. But it's easy to (carefully) adjust the shape of it, so I will probably figure this out soon!
        "
"
            I am very happy with this purchase. The earpiece was packaged with care and fits its description. I had to tweak it a bit to get it to fit my ear but the result is lovely. Olga responded quickly to my messages and did everything she could to ship it to me in time. Communication was very smooth and shipping was fast, I would definitely recommend this shop !

        "
"
            It's a beautiful piece! I ordered one ear cuff. Keep in mind it's designed to be both a cuff and a stud, so if you're like me and don't have your ears pierced you'll need a clip on converter for the flower stud.  Once I got one, it worked fine! Can't wait to wear it to my wedding
        "
"
            What beautiful and unique earrings! They arrived professionally packaged in a neat box with an adorable bow and flower attached! I wore these earrings right away at the airport and got complements from a custom agent. I was happy to tell him they came from Greece!

Now onto the earrings, they are extremely lightweight and comfortable to wear. At first I thought they were too long but then I got used to them. They can also be worn vertically if desired instead of as an ear crawler. I thought I would have to add an earring back but once they are in the hole and secure against your ear lobe they do not move or come off. I even swim with them on and had no problem, and slept with them too and they are so snug you don't notice they are there. To prevent moving around, press in the sterling silver bar tightly to secure. Love these!

            I absolutely love these earrings. I have received so many compliments about how they are ""so you.""  I never like wearing earrings because they usually are heavy on my ears or poke my head behind my ears. Most earrings irritate my skin, but these don't. These ones are light weight and lay in my ear naturally. i cant even feel them. I could sleep in them! Thank you, i will definitely be back!

            The earrings took two weeks to arrive. It was totally okay it's understandable because I ordered it on the 22nd of December. The earrings are simple and beautiful. I definitely needed a youtube video to help me put them on. After viewing the video it takes you seconds to put them on. Totally worth the money! Must by

            These ear climbers are adorable! Takes a little time to figure out how to get them in your ear and situated correctly, but once they are in they seem to hold well and look great. I have very small ears and didn't want something too large and these are the perfect size. Also, the items came so nicely packaged in their own boxes and with jewelry cleaning cloths. Always a really nice touch, would definitely buy from this shop again!

            This ear climber is truly brilliant; the sparkle is superlative! Quality is sturdy, and it stays in place for hours without leaving my ear feeling sore as other cartilage clips and magnets have done. 
Shipping was fast and the earrings were spotless and nicely packaged; I'm so looking forward to wearing this climber to several upcoming occasions! Thank you Iloniti!

            I had to switch these out for a different pair only because my ears are a bit smaller than average and it didn't sit right. Ilona to the rescue! She was so accommodating and allowed me to seamlessly exchange for a pair that perfectly compliment my headpiece and dress. Thank you soooo much!

            These earrings are so beautiful. I am absolutely in love. My ears are sensitive and my piercings close all the time and I love that I was able to get a clip on. They are so comfy and feel super secure! I can‚Äôt wait to wear for my wedding. Don‚Äôt think... just buy.
